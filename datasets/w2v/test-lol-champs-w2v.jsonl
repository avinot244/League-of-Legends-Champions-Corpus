{"text": "As warwick, Keep going for short burst trades with your Q in this matchup but don't use your E too freely. It can be used to bait Warwick under your tower.\n\nYour W will help you a lot in this matchup. Make sure you drop it on him when his E is active and he is running at you. Also, do not stay in the lane with low health.\n\nGet some Grievous Wounds quickly in this matchup. It will let you balance the duels that happen in the top lane.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and ask your Jungler to gank you regularly. Also, ensure that you tell the Jungler to be on high HP else Warwick will see the gank coming."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Trading against Heimerdinger can be extremely tedious, but it can be done. Removing his Turrets Q will be the main focus for poke or trading with him. When you use your skill shots (if they are AOE), try to target them so that they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q. This will allow you to clean them up more easily and increase your death pressure in the way. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, his death pressure and strength increase considerably. Keep this in mind and attention to his abilities empowered."}
{"text": "As jax, In addition, the CC aspect will allow him to score many peaks throughout the game. His mid-game is not as weak as his first game because he will have his basics and can use his Passive quite well. He will also be part of many objective fights, allowing him to land a multi-man e stun on the enemies. Once he gets two points in his Ultimate t, he will become powerful during the team fights. That's because his survival will increase, which will increase the amount of constant damage he has suffered with his automatic attacks."}
{"text": "As hecarim, He can easily be killed if he goes in without his Ultimate t and gets CC\u2019d by the enemy team. This will allow the enemy ranged carries to kite and kill him while the enemy tanks keep him away from their carries.\n\nThe enemy can completely counter him if they play in open spaces like the lane and are properly spaced when Hecarim goes in. This will prevent Hecarim from fearing the entire team and will allow the enemy team to retaliate.\n\nHecarim won\u2019t be able to flank the enemy freely if the enemy team sets proper vision around the lane they are fighting. This will force Hecarim to engage upon the enemy team in a direct fashion, which will allow the enemy team to react accordingly."}
{"text": "Against jax, Aim to trade when Jax has used his e as it will block the basic attacks. He has a long cooldown, so make sure to exploit his weakness. Jax does not have a build-in support and is melee. If you have the advantage of reach, try poke and harass him as much as possible to prevent him from searching for all-in. This will also force him to burn through his potions quickly. After level 6, each third car will provide extra magic damage. Do not engage in extended trades with him- especially if he was able to stack his auto attacks on the minions in advance."}
{"text": "As yasuo, After your bot lane has rotated to the mid lane, move to the side lane and start farming and gaining XP there. You can look to 1v1 any enemy who tries to stop you.\n\nLook for frequent trades with the enemy throughout the laning phase. Getting an early kill could snowball the lane heavily in your favour.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, look to play more aggressive. Your Ultimate R is a great skirmishing tool and you can get kills with it."}
{"text": "As diana, Diana is really good in team fights because her Ultimate R is a large AOE tool. She is really good in team fights.\n\nDiana\u2019s 1v1 potential throughout the game is very high. She can 1v1 most enemy Junglers to gain an early lead.\n\nPossibly one of the best flankers in the game. She can take out the enemy backline almost instantaneously during a team fight if she is left unchecked. Besides, if she happens to get caught, her tankiness and defensive items will keep her alive for quite some time."}
{"text": "As talon, His first games are quite solid because he can quickly E on the walls and catch the out-of-guard enemies. His damage is nothing to saw at either. Level 6 is a massive peak. He increases his overall burst of damage in the game, and he can easily bamboozle enemies by hiding himself. He can also use it defensively to avoid adverse situations. The first element should help him a lot with duels and his compensations. His release of damage will be really high during this phase of the game, and he can catch the out-of-guard enemies easily."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 11 is not a massive peak like other Supports. It only gives a slight increase in damage and no utility, unlike other Supports. That being said, the lower cooling certainly helps. Its first capacity will be maximized to level 9. This means that it can inflict a massive amount of burst damage to any enemy it gets too close. Pantheon is quite powerful during the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As karthus, It has a very fast clear jungle. This allows it to hit the major power peaks faster than the enemy Jungler. Karthus has tons of card pressure when his Ultimate e is up. As long as he keeps an eye on the minimap at all times, he can use it to easily pick up the killed. Even when Karthus dies, he is still a threat to the enemy team thanks to his Passive as he can continue to use his 1 and e briefly while he is dead."}
{"text": "As yone, Once he reaches level 16, he will use his ultimate R way more frequently. This means that he can easily choose enemies, as well as several CC enemies during the team fights. Yone will have all his articles finished by then. This means that he will hit like a truck, and whoever gets caught by him will probably die. Yone is superb at the end of the game because his articles will be finished, and he will have reached his most powerful powerpike. If the enemy team finds himself being CC-heavy, he should get a defensive element to preserve his power."}
{"text": "As neeko, Level six is a significant spike for Neeko as she gains access to her power Ultimate R. Team fighting will become really easy now.\n\nThe first component will allow her to spam abilities and not run out of mana. It will also let her deal a lot of damage in the lane.\n\nOnce the warding quest is done, Neeko can start setting up a vision around the map. Her W will make it quite challenging for the enemy to ambush her.        "}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen wins the pressure of the global card when he unlocks his Ultimate R. Follow him and play accordingly because he can influence a gank or fight in a way once he rises. His post-level 3 ganks are pretty good when he unlocked his taunt E. Shen. The choice of potential in the middle of the game can be devastating enough to play against."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Beware of roaming when Ziggs in lane as he has good wave clear and can easily take your tower while you\u2019re gone. Kill him and then roam when he\u2019s off the map.\n\nZiggs\u2019 main poke tool in lane is his Bouncing Bomb Q. This skill has a short cooldown and does a decent amount of AOE damage. Do not stand in the minion wave to avoid taking free damage.\n\nZigg\u2019s will be looking to constantly poke and push the minion wave so he can get an early tower with his W. Try to match his wave clear so he is unable to push you into Tower and take it easily."}
{"text": "As riven, Extremely weak when she is CC-D as she can't use her dashes and can be killed easily. This allows the enemy team to take her before a major fight or when her e is on cooldown. Too steep of a learning curve, which makes it very difficult for new players to master this champion. Efficiency is reduced if the player can't cancel the automatic attack animations. Very difficult for her to return to the game if she falls behind early. Very useful for the enemy team to spoil her when she is pushed up or dive her when her r is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 9, Ezreal will max out his Q. He will be quite strong at this stage of the game thanks to the additional damage his Q will do and the items he would\u2019ve picked up by then.\n\nPutting the second point in Ezreal\u2019s Ultimate R at level 11 will offer him a lot of extra damage. He will also be able to threaten steals on major objectives like the Baron or Dragons.\n\nEzreal is really good at poking the enemies down before a fight thanks to his low cooldowns and overall damage. During the mid-game, he will be able to harass and poke the enemy a lot."}
{"text": "As zeri, Just play safe and focus on using your charged attacks and Q to poke the enemy out. Ward around the lane for extra precaution.\n\nUse your E with extreme discretion in this matchup. It can save you from ganks if you manage to hug the terrain while pushing. Be careful though as it can give a lot of incentive to mid-laners with skillshots.\n\nOn getting your Ultimate R, you should be able to dictate the pace of crucial neutral objective fights. Just make sure that you don't go too deep.  "}
{"text": "Against shaco, Shaco has good Dragon control in the early game. Make sure you keep it warded at all times so you can spot him before he takes it.\n\nHis duelling power is rather good in the early game. Think twice before fighting him especially if you\u2019re spotted as he may place a Box x behind him and use try to chase him down.\n\nAs a laner, warding bushes directly outside of lane won\u2019t prevent a gank, so you want to ward in places where he can Deceive e over terrain of some kind."}
{"text": "As poppy, Focus on getting level 3 first so that you can gank reliably. Try to ask your laners to give you a hard leash and make good use of your Passive.\n\nOnce level 3, you will want to actively target overextended targets when you get the chance. This will allow you to get your laners ahead and will allow you to assert a lot of pressure in the game.\n\nLevel six isn't that huge of a power spike. It allows you to win neutral, objective fights, though. You can just Ultimate R the enemy Jungler away so that they can't Smite the objective.        "}
{"text": "As soraka, Soraka is really good in team fights due to her Q and E. The amount of damage and healing she can provide is phenomenal and should allow her team to play more fearlessly in the game.\n\nOnce Soraka gets 2 points in her Ultimate R, her ability to impact fights increase as a whole. She can use the ability quite frequently as well, which allows her to save her teammates often.\n\nHer W and Q > W combo will provide a lot of healing for her team. All she needs to do is make sure that she doesn't get picked off while warding.        "}
{"text": "Against karma, Karma has her Ultimate a at level 1, so she will be strong enough up to level 6. If you are strong at level 6, you will be stronger than she once you both have reached level 6. Do not isolate yourself at all from the minion wave. Stay behind the minions at any time (but not too close to them because her Q deals AOE damage) so they block the damage. When Karma uses her d, she will be vulnerable to attack."}
{"text": "As morgana, Look at your abilities so that they hit both the ziggs and the minion wave at the same time. Stand outside the wave so that it can not push adn you poke at the same time. Its level 6 is stronger than yours. Keep this in mind when you fight early. This is an agricultural game."}
{"text": "Against ekko, Ekkos main source of damage comes from his Passive. Avoid letting him stack his Passive by dodging his Q and standing outside his E range.\n\nEkko will look to set up a W stun by walking out of vision. Be cautious of this and wait a few seconds after he appears again before trading with him.\n\nEkko will look to constantly push the wave with his Q.  Punish him whenever he uses it for waveclear by engaging in trades."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, She doesn\u2019t do well in extended auto-attack trades. Wait for her to waste her C or Q and then use the cooldown to play aggressive and kill her. \n\nTaliyah doesn\u2019t gain access to a damaging Ultimate R at level 6. If you\u2019re a champion with a strong Ultimate, try to abuse her weakness at this time.\n\nWhen trading with Taliyah, always keep behind at least 1 minion. This will make it very difficult for her to deal damage with her Q."}
{"text": "As masteryi, A fully maxed out Ultimate r will allow Master Yi to mow down the enemy team. This is highly beneficial when it comes to cleaning up late-game fights.\n\nHis damage will be massive during the late game. He can keep on all-in'ing enemies as his Ultimate r will be up quite frequently.\n\nHis team fighting is on another level during this phase of the game. This means that he will be the pivot for his team's success, and his e usage will determine the game's outcome."}
{"text": "As akali, At this stage, teams will be closely grouped together so it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be able to assassinate anyone. Continue to look for picks but expect there to be more than just 1 enemy nearby.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult for you to 100 to 0 someone as many champions will be full build in the late game or at least have defensive tools like Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass or Guardian Angel available to them.\n\nContinue to play team fights slow. While your cooldowns will be short, you need to play around your W as much as possible to ensure you can kill the enemy."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan IV will be unlocking his d > e combo at level two, which will allow him to catch and CC overextended enemies with utmost ease. This will also let him show extreme prowess during Jungle duels.\n\nJarvan's first item component will give him a massive boost to his dueling and survivability. He will now be able to put his d Passive to good use, especially if he manages to catch an enemy out on his own.\n\nJarvan IV will unlock the ability to completely separate an enemy out from their team and lock them down at level 6. It is incredibly beneficial when the main goal is to separate out a single target and get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Poppy does not point to level 6 as most Supports that its Ultimate R is primarily a utility tool. However, it can use it closely to start a fight. Keep this in mind and keep your distance. More Poppy gold gets under its belt, the stronger it will be. Note that you will need to invest in armor or magic pen items if you want to break through its defensive stats. Once Poppy has both its E and Q unlocked, its all-in-one potential increases. Try your hardest to stand away from walls at any time during the wool setting phase."}
{"text": "As yasuo, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline line. Flank in the team fights to get the enemy backline up easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight, especially allies with knockups."}
{"text": "As aphelios, Aphelios is good in the team fights in the middle of the match thanks to the potential of his Ultimate R and the mix of his weapons. As long as he has not fallen behind in the beginning of the game, his mid-game will be where he will really shine. During the middle of the match, Aphelios should have finished several articles. He will start to cut down a lot of damage, and he will find it much easier to get down the enemy front line. Aphelios is a good champion in the middle of the match, especially when he is associated with a utility support or a team that can empower him."}
{"text": "Against tristana, The extended trades will work heavily in favour of Tristana, if she has placed her E on you. At level 6, Tristana, killing pressure increases because her Ultimate R can cause you a lot of damage in the 1v1 trades. Its Ultimate R is also versatile and can be used as a self-plubbing tool. When it reaches level 9, it would have maximized its first ability. Its potential 1v1 will be much higher from below."}
{"text": "Against swain, When the laning, make sure that you have always stayed far behind, but in front of your Caster Minions. This will not allow him to land his Root E and CC you. The extended automatic attack jobs will always work in favor of the AD champions. Wait for him to use his E before playing aggressively and looking for the all-in-one. Swain=s support will be a problem; especially if he is with a healing support."}
{"text": "As seraphine, During the laning phase, focus on poking the enemy down to gain a health advantage. When the enemy is low, commit to an all-in.\n\nTry your hardest to keep your ADC alive for as long as possible in lane. Provide them with heals W whenever they need them.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "Against zoe, The ZO range increases on its Q and E once it reaches level 6. At this time, its death pressure will also increase. Whenever its E is in place, play safer. Its damage production increases considerably once its first article is finished. It will also be able to release the waves very easily. Stand behind the minion wave at any time. The more the game goes, the stronger Zoe becomes. In particular, it is very good in the middle of the game and its selection potential is incredibly strong."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan has the range advantage and will try to bully you down with his superior range. In the early game, only move forward to trade or secure minions so he cannot bully you for free.\n \nFocus on keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early. This will prevent him from zoning you away from farm, and also allow you to all-in him when he walks up to the minion wave.\n\nYour level 6 power spike is far superior to his. Keep this in mind and try to play aggressive and shut him down when you\u2019re level 6.\n\nA good time to trade or fight Akshan is when he uses his jump aggressively. You can then jump on him, CC him and then try to fight him."}
{"text": "Against shaco, At level 1, wait for Shaco to have placed several x boxes around the track. Wait for the minion wave to approach before walking towards the track. Do not hug the side of the track at level 1 as it is likely that he has placed boxes there. Avoid standing towards the sides of the track. It is better to stand in the middle and follow the line the minions take so it is impossible for any x box he has placed to attack you. If Shaco does something funky, it is probably because he baits you in his x boxes! Do not fall for it as you will always come worse."}
{"text": "As irelia, Irelia is extremely strong when her Passive is stacked up. This is when she should be going for a significant fight as it will ensure a massive victory for her as long as she has a target to auto-attack. Bonus points to survivability if she can Q to minions and reset the ability.\n\nThe first item component will help Irelia massively in this lane. It will bolster her dueling potential and increase her survivability. It will be highly beneficial when her Passive is stacked up completely.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant power spike where Irelia can start dictating the pace of this lane. Her opponent will have to be very careful as Irelia can decimate them with her Ultimate R and Q should they get hit by the initial Ultimate R cast."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Forcing a fight or fighting when Swain isn\u2019t around will make it easier for your team to win team fights.\n\nAvoid grouping too closely around objectives or in team fights as it may allow Swain to land a really good multi-person E and start the team fight.\n\nBurst and poke is the best way of winning a fight against Swain. Try to poke him down before a team fight starts. When he activates his Ultimate R, burst him down so he is unable to dish out lots of damage."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius starts to fall in the end of the game, but it is still powerful. He falls as other champions start to get elements that counter him, and many champions will be more tankier, which makes it harder for him to kill them. At level 16, Dariuss Ultimate e will be an essential tool in team fighting. As he can do a considerable amount of damage and as he is an execution- he will be able to remove targets and use reset to kill several targets. At this stage of the game, Darius should be almost max build. As he builds items that increase his damage and offer protection, he will be relatively tanky and difficult to remove."}
{"text": "As azir, Purchasing a Sweeper and playing around vision will be really good as you will be able to flank and 'Shurima Shuffle' the enemy backline into your team with your Ultimate R.\n\nBe on the lookout to secure picks when inside the enemy Jungle. The enemy Support and Jungler will have to set vision up, which makes them prime pick targets. Get rid of them and then use the numbers advantage to win a fight.\n\nIf you see one of the enemy carries in the side lanes, see if you can flank them from the fog of war and kill them rapidly. This can be done very easily, even when the target is near their tower, due to your Ultimate R displacement distance."}
{"text": "As sett, His mid-game team fight is quite powerful during this phase of the game, especially if he gets a multi-man E on the enemy. The second point of his Ultimate R will allow him to do more damage with the ability. It is necessary to make sure that he throws the target in the right direction. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to inflict massive amounts of damage during the ganks and mid-game fights."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Level 2 is a massive spike as Nautilus can now all-in the enemy blatantly and come out of the engage after taking no damage in return.\n\nOnce he hits level six, the enemy will have to play very carefully in the game. The enemy can't come too close to Nautilus, else they will get killed immediately.\n\nBoots are a minor powerspike in the lane but will allow Nautilus to roam quite frequently. This will allow him to help other lanes out and invade the enemy jungle with the allied Jungler.        "}
{"text": "As shaco, Look for picks all around the map during this phase of the game. If you can take down a carry from the enemy team, the next fight will pretty much be a guaranteed win.\n\nUse your Ultimate l carefully during this phase of the game. Remember that you can easily target the enemy backline with it while your team deals with the enemy frontline.\n\nWhen fighting around choke points, make sure that you set your x around properly. Also, make it a point to use your Ultimate l around chokepoints for maximal effectiveness."}
{"text": "As volibear, Once he has reached level 11, he will put another point in his Ultimate R. This will make him more powerful and cement his position as a player in the team. Volibear's first ability will be maximized to level 9. This is very beneficial as his duel potential will skyrocket, and his ganks will become more powerful. Volibear is good in team fighting due to his E, Passive and Ultimate R. He should use the fog of war and target the essential portages on the enemy team whenever possible."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Always try to Ultimate e Taliyah as that will get her killed easily. She can't do much once CC'd and Supressed at the same time.\n\nRemember that Taliyah will certainly get a defensive item to counter your damage and all-ins. You will have to bait it out before looking for a full blown all-in on her, else you will definitely end up dying.\n\nTaliyah will be focusing to counter gank you a lot in this matchup. This means that when going for an all-in, use your dash with extreme discretion.\n\nIt is important to keep an eye on Taliyah's whereabouts in this matchup, else, she can easily interrupt or initiate a gank using her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As gangplank, The level 6 of Gangplank is a good powerspike for him in this way, especially if Gankplank has been pushed all the time. This will allow him to hunt the enemies with ease and kill them if he has already piqued them with his r. He also has a significant impact during the team fights. His initial base element will give him a massive boost in duel power. He can now go, and 1 v 1 targets with ease and can completely blow the enemies with his barrels. His early play is weak because he is entirely dependent on items to cover the damage. However, he can compensate for her using his r to fire the enemies with ease and use the brushes of the track to hide his barrels. He will catch the out-of-guard enemies and will allow Gankplank to get the top."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, Mordekaiser has a healthy but slow light in early play. Try and invade him to steal his camps to delay his first power peak. Fortunately, Mordekaiser has rather scenarized ganks. Place the vision around his jungle entrances to spot him leaving his jungle. If you are nearby, you could try to counter gank; but at least ping his position. Once Mordekaiser reaches level 6, he will find a little easier gank with his Ultimate R. Try to match his pressure by gauntling as much as you can in the early game, and whenever he shows up on one side of the map, try gank another way or take a goal."}
{"text": "As ezreal, This can also allow it to go up to all enemies once they are low enough after taking the Poke Ezreal Dam has to offer. Its Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during early play to wave. This is very useful when it tries to clear the wave quickly in order to get a reminder. Ezreal=\"E allows it to exit sticky situations with ease and makes it one of the safest ADCs in the game. It can also buffer it in response to the CC capabilities that will allow it to avoid following CC if it manages to get the initial CC capability."}
{"text": "As orianna, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in the way. You have a lot of poke, so try poke the enemy down as often as you can. Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your d. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}
{"text": "As skarner, His first ability will be maxed out at level 9. It should bolster his survivability and damage in the game, and he should be able to make more picks now.\n\nSkarner\u2019s team fighting is phenomenal during this phase of the game. He can soak up damage while ensuring that he gets crucial picks on the enemy team.\n\nAt level 11, he would put a second point in his Ultimate. The reduced cooldown will help him make picks more frequently.\n"}
{"text": "Against hwei, When he hits level 3, he becomes stronger and he is harder to handle. Bait out abilities and then fight him.\n\nOnce he hits level 6, he unlocks his R which makes him better in 1v1 fights.\n\nAs the game progresses, and as teams start grouping, Hwei becomes stronger and stronger as he is a great team-fighting champion.\n"}
{"text": "As monkeyking, The final point in his Ultimate n will allow him to deal tremendous amounts of damage to the enemies. He should try to look for flanks during team fights to maximize his Ultimate n usage.\n\nHe will have many items now, which will make him really tanky and will allow him to deal lots and lots of damage in a short amount of time. The enemy team will have a hard time dealing with him.\n\nWukong is pretty intense during this phase of the game, but he will have a hard time killing them due to them purchasing defensive items. You will want to group up with your team as frequently as you can."}
{"text": "Against shen, Take care as Shen has good ambush potential in the mid-game thanks to his E. Do not go to ward or walk in unwarded parts of the map if you know Shen has been nearby as it may result in your death.\n\nIf Shen uses his Ultimate R and leaves his ADC alone in lane, try to kill them as he will be unable to protect them if he is elsewhere on the map. However, you could cancel his Ultimate R if you think he will be able to turn the exchange around.\n\nTry and poke and harass Shen down before a team fight starts. If he is low, he will find it very difficult for him to peel and protect his carries. "}
{"text": "As karthus, He has a really fast jungle clear. This allows him to hit major power spikes faster than the enemy Jungler.\n\nKarthus has tons of map pressure when his Ultimate e is up. As long as he keeps an eye on the minimap at all times, he can use it to pick up kills easily.\n\nEven when Karthus dies, he is still a threat to the enemy team thanks to his Passive as he can continue to use his 1 and e briefly while he is dead."}
{"text": "As sivir, Just like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone as you will die easily.\n\nDo not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and auto-attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will focus you and take you down.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target."}
{"text": "As yasuo, If you succeed in reaching a high priority target, you should be able to enter and do a quick job from them. Get a defensive element as quickly as you can. This will help a lot when you deal with CC in this game, because CC is your worst enemy can get you killed indefinitely. In the late game, look for shots on immobile or misplaced enemies. Taking someone into the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, seat a goal or take the Baron or the Old Dragon."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, Avoid team fights around major goals if Seraphine is nearby. The tight grouping will benefit her and allow her to get a good Ultimate Roff and CC all your team. Similarly, avoid fighting in the jungle because your team will be grouped together, which can allow her to get another good Ultimate Roff. Try to fight in the open air and separate slightly so she can't CC your entire team. Seraphine will often go to the hall alone during the middle of the game. You can use this to your advantage to fight and choose her. While she's dead, you can look to take the Baron, a Dragon or look for a team fight with the advantage of numbers."}
{"text": "As shaco, The first ability will be maximized to level 9. This ability will now hit like a truck, and it can quickly assassinate enemies if they are weak. Shaco is decent enough during team fighting. This is mainly because his clone can cause all around the mahema for the enemy team. His ability to sneak behind the enemy team is phenomenal. Team fighting will become better for Shaco. Another point in his Ultimate it will allow him to use the ability frequently and increase the damage of the clone bursting."}
{"text": "As neeko, Level six is an important peak for Neeko as it gains access to its Ultimate R power. Team fighting will become really easy now. Its early play is pretty decent because it can get the enemies out of the range. Its E will be empowered if it can properly manipulate the minion wave. The first component will allow it to spam capabilities and not lack mana. It will also allow it to do a lot of damage in the way."}
{"text": "As sion, Its tankness will be really high during this phase of the game due to its articles. This, combined with its W, will make it almost indestructible and will allow it to absorb a lot of damage. A completely exhausted maximum Ultimate R will further strengthen its all-in-all potential and the overall damage inflicted in the long term. It will be a massive peak of power for it because it can ensure easy choices with it. It is great during the fighting of the team of the end of the game due to its Q and Ultimate R. Its efficiency increases if it manages to find a flank on its enemies or land its Ultimate R on a group of enemies stuck together."}
{"text": "As xerath, Distinguish yourself from the wave of minions as much as possible. This will force the Xerath to choose between pushing and pushing you. Correspond to its thrust power.

Usually, Ezreal will want to recall once he has enough gold for Tear."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks Ultimate R is very good in team fights, especially in closed areas as it will allow him to deal damage to tons of champions at once.\n\nFurthermore, in team fights, his W will heal him a lot. The extra sustain/damage will be really beneficial in team fights.\n\nFiddlesticks laning phase is pretty simple. He is also pretty safe in lane. Focus on poking, trading, and not falling behind."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Poke the enemy and harass them as much as you can before looking to fight. Bursting someone down with a few Q\u2019s and your R will allow you to force a team fight with the numbers or health advantage.\n\nAvoid using your E aggressively in late game fights as you\u2019ll be vulnerable briefly. Only use it aggressively if you\u2019re 100% sure you cannot get abused for it.\n\nStick with your team and avoid walking too far away from them. If you get caught out, your team will lose out on a lot of damage in a team fight, and it would be your fault. Stick with your team as much as possible."}
{"text": "As brand, He will be dishing out humongous amounts of damage during this phase of the game. Right now, he should be focusing on staying alive and not getting CC'd and picked off by the enemy team.\n\nFighting around chokepoints is absolutely necessary as Brand will be pretty effective with his Ultimate R. The ability will have quite a short cooldown, making it easy for him to win team fights frequently.\n\nHe should be working with his team and setting up death brushes around the map. His ability to completely blow up squishy targets will make team fights highly unfair for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level 3 is a decent powerpike because Heimerdinger will have access to all its capabilities. It can easily ADC still CC and explodes them with its turrets and rockets. Its E will be very beneficial in going for objective battles. Level 6 is undoubtedly a colossal peak of power for Heimerdinger, as it can now lure enemies to their death with ease. It can also take towers very quickly or slow several enemies with its E. The first mythical element will allow Heimerdinger to deposit a ton of damage of poke in the track with its turrets. Its gust damage will also be quite powerful, and it can fire an enemy with the greatest ease."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 9, Ezreal will max out his Q. He will be quite strong at this stage of the game thanks to the additional damage his Q will do and the items he would\u2019ve picked up by then.\n\nPutting the second point in Ezreal\u2019s Ultimate R at level 11 will offer him a lot of extra damage. He will also be able to threaten steals on major objectives like the Baron or Dragons.\n\nEzreal is really good at poking the enemies down before a fight thanks to his low cooldowns and overall damage. During the mid-game, he will be able to harass and poke the enemy a lot."}
{"text": "Against nilah, Avoid fighting in the jungle because the teams will be regrouped, which will allow him to get a multi-person Ultimate. Bought out of his W before starting a team fight and then abusing the cooldown. Wait for him to finish, then start the fight. Lock her up with CC at the beginning of the fight. It will make it difficult for him to reposition himself with his E and escape."}
{"text": "As renekton, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate t is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate t is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "Against lux, Always make sure that you are standing behind at least 2 minions so that she is unable to root you with her g. If Lux uses her g and missing it, use the cooldown of this aggressive ability to play because she will not be able to protect herself and prevent the effectiveness of all-in. Mitigate Lux=l standing behind and not inside the wave minion. This will make her choose between using her l for poke with or to push with."}
{"text": "As draven, Once you have destroyed the first lap in the track, turn to the middle lane and try to seat the center tower to open the map. While Draven has tons of pressure to kill, it's important that you don't walk too far from your team at any given time. Stick with your Support and hold their hand. Wait for your teammates to make the first move. Let them engage while you focus on the automatic attack of the nearest enemy champion and pick up your Axes g."}
{"text": "As chogath, After Cho\u2019Gath has put multiple points in his s, he will be able to trade more effectively with the enemy. Combined with some of his other power spikes we will discuss, he can start to out-trade many enemy champions.\n\nCho\u2019Gath cannot trade too well until after his first back. When he picks up his first component item, trading becomes much easier for him as his damage and survivability increases. \n\nAt level 6, Cho\u2019Gath\u2019s kill pressure intensifies as he can execute an enemy champion if they overextend. Even if he cannot kill them, he can still put his Ultimate t to good use."}
{"text": "As jhin, Try to keep the wave either in the middle of the track, or keep pushing it into its turret so you can win a good CS lead. At level 6, Jhin is stronger than you in 2v2. But if he activates his R, run on him to force him to cancel it. Focus on early farming so you can get CS and gold under your belt. When you have your first item, look for more aggressive play."}
{"text": "As urgot, Urgot's first game is quite good, especially once it has access to all its basic capabilities. It can easily all-in an enemy and then proceed to destroy them with its passive and automatic attacks. The level six of Urgot is solid because it allows it to execute its targets when they are below a certain threshold of health. It is really good when trying to deal with tanks. The first element of Urgot will be beneficial because it will increase its overall damage and survival in the way. It will be instrumental when it will be combined with the regular use of track brushes by Urgot."}
{"text": "As pyke, Pyke is a very mobile champion thanks to his W and E. This allows him to escape sticky situations quite easily.

{"text": "As seraphine, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As lillia, Lillia is really fast and mobile thanks to her Passive. This makes her hard to catch out of position. It will also allow you to dodge skill shots and CC.\n\nYour goal in the early game is to gain as much gold and XP as quickly as you can. Power farm and gank lanes that are overextended to increase your gold income.\n\nYour Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Whenever it is up, try to use it to help your allies get kills.        "}
{"text": "Against camille, Try and stay closely grouped as a team when playing against Camille to make it very hard for her to engage. Camille will want to lock down an isolated target with her Ultimate R, but by standing close together it will reduce her ability to do so.\n \nCamille will often hunt vulnerable targets who are isolated walking around the map. Stick with your team to reduce Camille\u2019s assassination attempts.\n \nIn addition to grouping closely, Camille cannot easily get on to the backline by running at the enemy. Instead, she will try to flank from the side. So whenever you\u2019re sieging an objective or fighting in a lane, make sure you have sufficient ward coverage to the sides so you can spot her before she engages."}
{"text": "Against sejuani, You can reduce Sejuani\u2019s ability to get successful ganks of by warding her jungle entrances or placing wards in the river. If you know where she is, she will be unable to get good ganks off.\n\nSejuani has good Drake control in the early game. Ensure that you take the bottom side scuttle crab and keep the Drake warded at all times so she is unable to sneak it away from your team.\n\nOnce Sejuani hits level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, she will be looking to gank as often as she can. You could delay this power spike by invading her in the early game or stealing away her camps when she is spotted on the other side of the map."}
{"text": "As anivia, Anivia doesn\u2019t spike at levels 2 or 3 like most champions. This is because she is weak in the early game and needs a lot of time to come online. But, that doesn't mean landing a cheeky t will not be impactful.\n\nOnce Anivia has completed her first component item, her kill pressure and ability to trade with the enemy will increase. It is not a bad option to play somewhat safe early and then play more aggressive after your first back.\n\nWhenever Anivia\u2019s Egg is down, you need to play somewhat safe and avoid overextending. You\u2019re an easy target for the enemy ADC and Support if you overextend while it\u2019s down."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of kill pressure in the mid-game, especially once she puts 2 points in her Ultimate R. The reduced cooldown and additional damage make her a huge threat during this stage of the game.\n\nCass should have her Tear stacked by this stage of the game. She will have a somewhat endless mana pool once it\u2019s maxed out.\n\nAt level 9, Cass will max out her E. As long as she lands her Q, her bully potential will be incredibly potent. Her all-in heavily intensifies at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As zac, Massive all-in potential with the ability to chain his crowd control abilities with his allies. This makes him a very potent ganker, especially due to how his E works.\n\nHe can keep gaining some of his health back in a fight by collecting his W blobs. This makes it very hard for his enemies to kill him easily, which makes focusing him down first quite useless.\n\nHis Passive and Ultimate R can allow him to singlehandedly take a group of enemies out of a major team fight, by simply zoning them away. He can also deal a lot of damage to the enemy backline if they ignore Zac."}
{"text": "Against sejuani, Once Sejuani reaches level 6, her death pressure increases significantly as her Ultimate R is an excellent inflation tool. Expect that she will inflate every time her Ultimate R is in place. As soon as Sejuani finishes her juggling, it will be difficult for you to kill her because she will rather be tanky. Avoid fighting her at that time unless you have an advantage. Sejuani is really good during the middle and end of the game because she can catch the players in a team fight with her Ultimate R. Look at your positioning so she can't isolate you and start the team fight."}
{"text": "As soraka, Mid-game will require you to be poking enemies and healing allies at the same time. Don't wander around alone as killing you is very easy.\n\nYour E placement can make or break a fight with ease.

Do not overuse your W though, else you will end up dying quickly.        "}
{"text": "As kayle, The 2 points in his Ultimate R will give him another significant peak of power. This will allow him to get rid of a lot of damage. His first ability will be maximized to level 9.

It will get added effects, and consecutively self-attack will allow him to melt through the enemies."}
{"text": "Against poppy, The more the game goes, the Poppy Tanker will become. Try and reduce its gold revenue by flying its camps during the start of the game. This will also delay some of its other power peaks. According to its construction path, Poppy Power peaks will change as its AD construction and tank have different power peaks. Once Poppy touches Level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate R, it will have much more utility and will be able to disengage from a skirmish."}
{"text": "As lissandra, At level 9, Lissandra's Q will be maxed out. This means that she will be dealing tons of damage now, especially in grouped fights.\n\nLissandra is really good in team fights. She can easily CC high priority targets and single-handedly win a team fight due to her AoE abilities and Passive.\n\nHer Ultimate R at level 11 will provide her with a lot of pick potential. She can use that ability frequently, which means that team fights and picks will be pretty frequent."}

He should accumulate a lead during this phase of the game by bursting enemies down with his Q and Ultimate e.\n\nHe is terrific in team fights due to his Q , E, and Ultimate e.

Make sure you secure all the Dragons when possible to deny them from the enemy.\n\nAt level 6 is when the enemy will probably start ganking. You can track them with good vision through wards placed in and around the river. If you\u2019re nearby, try to counter gank as they have nothing to offer once they\u2019ve used their abilities which you can capitalise on. If you\u2019re not nearby, start the Dragon or try to gank a different lane.\n\nWhile the enemy Jungler will not be ganking, fighting them alone will be difficult as they have tools to escape or prevent the fight. If you spot them alone, try to force them out of their jungle without over committing to the fight without assistance. A good time to invade and look for them is when your lanes nearby have priority."}
{"text": "As samira, Just like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone as you will die easily.\n\nDo not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and auto-attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will focus you and take you down.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target."}
{"text": "As masteryi, 2 points in his Ultimate r will make him more powerful during the fights. He will have to flank enemies and make sure that the entire CC on the side of the enemy teams is exhausted. His first ability will be maximized at level 9, which will allow him to inflict heavy amounts of damage in a very short period of time. He is decent enough during the team fights. He can completely decimate the enemy team if he manages to get an e reset off with his Ultimate r activated."}
{"text": "As samira, Samira has an incredibly strong all-in-one. This will allow him to go for the murders frequently, especially when the enemy overextends or walks too far.

{"text": "As milio, Unfortunately, Milio has long cooldowns, especially with its Ultimate. It's the key he doesn't waste his abilities or it will be an easy target. Positioning can be difficult for Milio as it can easily be killed and locked with CC. If he gets CC=d he can't use his Ultimate, so it's important that he never get CC=d. Moreover, Milio is sensitive enough to CC. It's quite motionless and squishy, so positioning is the key."}
{"text": "Against varus, Varus is good at level 6 thanks to its Ultimate R. It has good selection potential and good gank configuration. Varus is excellent in team fighting thanks to its poke damage and the selection potential of its Ultimate R. Be on the lookout for aggressive games and don't walk too far in team fighting.

If you manage to accumulate a lead, you should quickly take over the game from there.\n\nGetting your form is going to be massive for you.

{"text": "Against cassiopeia, In team fights, don't regroup closely to make it impossible to land a Ultimate R. Be ready to turn if she looks like she's about to launch her Ultimate R. Never fight the enemy in the jungle or around a goal like her Ultimate R is really good in tight areas when teams are stuck together. Fight spaced in a track when possible. Cassiopeia will seek to ambuish or assassinate targets that move across the river alone.

At level 14, two of his capabilities will be completely out of date. It will be an increase in his overall gank potential, and Warwick will benefit significantly."}
{"text": "Against gnar, Gnar can easily escape ganks with his E. Try and bait this ability out before your Jungler arrives in your lane to reduce his chances of escaping.\n\nDo not commit to using your Ignite or any burst spells if Gnar is about to change forms as Mega Gnar gives him extra health that will allow him to survive. \n\nAs he is a ranged champion, it\u2019s important that you do not let him poke you down and harass you with basic attacks. Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP if you\u2019re low."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Focus on getting level 3 quickly in this matchup and make sure you ask for a hard leash early on. It will allow you to gank enemies quickly after that. Look at all the overt enemies as much as you can since your g and e will both facilitate CC'ing the enemy."}
{"text": "As kaisa, It is important that you stick with your team in the late game. Do not move around the map or go anywhere unless someone is with you.\n\nStand towards the back end of your team near your Support. Avoid walking too far away from anyone in the late game. Getting caught out will result in the enemy being able to push their advantage and finish the game.\n\nWatch your positioning in the late game. Focus on kiting and auto-attacking the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so you do not get caught out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "Against syndra, Watch your flanks and avoid walking on an unclassified territory because Syndra has an excellent configuration with its combo Q and E. Don't let Syndra take you down before a team fight happens. Its goal will be to harass as much as it can before you look for a choice. Get involved as fast as you can so that it can't bring you down. Avoid fighting in the jungle or around an objective as it will facilitate multi-person landing and stunning. Fight in the open air when possible and avoid regrouping too closely."}
{"text": "As maokai, They will be ganking early, and Pantheon can gank early, too. Make sure you apply as much pressure to them as you can.\n\nPost 6, it\u2019s better to avoid fighting him unless you have a clear advantage, as it will take some time for you to kill him due to his tankyness and Ultimate.\n\nPlace vision around the map to help you spot him before he can gank your allies. Maokai is a strong early ganker.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to secure those objectives. You have good objective control, so make sure you use it!\n"}
{"text": "As kled, Kled is really good early on as he can use his Q and E to all-in and destroy his enemy in trades. His W plays a pivotal role in it as well.\n\nOnce Kled hits level 6, he will gain access to his Ultimate R, which will allow him to all-in laners in different lanes. He can even pay a surprise visit to the bot lane.\n\nThe first item component will increase Kled's dueling potential. It will make him more powerful than he already is, which is terrible news for the enemy.        "}
{"text": "As trundle, Another point in his Ultimate n will strengthen his overall power during the duels. This will also allow him to have a massive presence during the team fights. He should have his basic elements now. This means that he will be tanky and will do a lot of damage to his enemies. This should be amplified with his Ultimate n. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will give a significant boost to his skirmish potential during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "Against yuumi, Yuumi will seek to bring you down with her Q. When she uses it, run inside the minion wave so she can't easily land it. Otherwise, if it's safe to do so, stand inside the minion wave at all times. Invest in an early execution call or similar Wounds Grevious article to reduce her healing and support in team fights."}
{"text": "As irelia, After the laning phase has ended, go to a different lane (or stay top) and just split push. You\u2019re a good split pusher and can draw a lot of attention to your lane.\n\nIf somebody tries to contest your split push, look to fight them. Irelia is a good duelist and will be able to fight most enemies who try to stop her.\n\nWhile you\u2019re a champion that is usually sent to split push, you might need to group with your team if the enemy is trying to force something. Be prepared to rotate around the map and help them fight."}
{"text": "As renekton, You will want to keep it falling with your e in this matchup. It will be very easy for you to take Renekton quickly. Keep your Resource Bar half filled before a trade to inflict maximum damage to the enemy. This is important to counter its bursting. Your Ultimate will allow you to easily all-in Renekton or separate it from his team. Use this opportunity to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Keep the wave in the middle of the way as long as possible in this matchup. This will help a lot when it comes to dealing with his all-in."}
{"text": "Against lucian, Level 2 is the first wave followed by a melee minion on the second wave. At level 6, Lucian has much more trading power thanks to his Ultimate R. Once he activates it, try to reposition it, disengage it or lock it with CC, so that he is unable to land all the balls on you. Every time Lucian E is up, he will be stronger than he can dodge addresses and CC. If he uses this ability aggressively, use the cooldown of it to play aggressive and trade with him."}
{"text": "As elise, Look to gank as often as you can. Elise is a good early game Jungler so you need to get your allies ahead by ganking as frequently as you can. She can start ganking from level 3 onwards when she has access to her E.\n\nMake sure you put focus on securing Dragons and objectives with your team. Elise can easily take objectives on her own, but you\u2019ll have more security if you do it with your allies.\n\nWhile Elise is a gank heavy Jungler, make sure you find a healthy balance between farming and ganking. Getting kills is good, but you need the XP and gold that comes from jungle camps to get ahead."}
{"text": "As vex, Try to set up death brushes when possible. Your W will easily fear enemies when combined with your Passive, and you can then blow them up. Stay with your team and take fights in or around bottlenecks for maximum efficiency. This will allow you to get multiple murders in a short period and ultimately win the game."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce has tons of poke damage and can constantly abuse the enemy before initiating a fight. Try to delay fights while you harass the enemy with your s.\n\nAs Jayce is a ranged champion, you can often bully melee champions down and harass them whenever they walk up to last hit.\n\nJayce has a lot of utility thanks to his basic abilities. This allows him to help his team out alot and helps them disengage or engage from fights with ease."}
{"text": "As zac, Take advantage of your range advantage against Zac, but be careful not to overextend and put yourself in a vulnerable position. Constant harassment can lead to your death, so pay attention to the risks involved. Be aware of Zac's crowd control capability (CC) and avoid detachment from your ADC when it is available. Being caught by its CC can lead to a dangerous all-in-one situation. Stay attached to security during these moments. Be careful of Zac's increased pressure at level 6. Its ultimate ability enhances its ability to engage and secure murders. Adjust your game style accordingly, prioritising safety and avoiding unnecessary risks. Zac excels in roaming, so it is important to piner and communicate with your team when it lacks track. Use this opportunity to apply pressure and intimidate his ADC while he is absent, making it difficult for the enemy bot track to trade effectively."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level sixteen will further reduce the cooling of its Ultimate t and increase the damage of its mushrooms. Enemies will have a hard time crossing bottlenecks now. It will have a lot of Hast capacity now, which means that it can deposit a lot more mushrooms around the map. Enemies will have to invest massively in the vision to keep themselves safe. It will complete its construction during this phase of the game, which will allow it to shoot a squisy target. Its blind t should come in practice during this phase of the game as well."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn't be fighting unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. Push the wave and look for roaming opportunities. Lissandra is a very good roaming champion that can impact the card and help its allies with ease."}
{"text": "As ksante, Roam around the map and look for picks with your Ultimate and use the amazing amount of CC you have to help your team get kills.\n\nPeel for your carries in team fights. Soak up damage and let them dish out damage. You could also use your Ultimate to isolate and take away key damage dealers.\n\nRemember to farm. You need to find a healthy balance between farming side lanes and team fighting with your team.\n"}
{"text": "As rakan, It\u2019s very important that you hit level 2 at the same time as Rakan. If you\u2019re not going to, back off slightly so they can\u2019t all-in you as soon as they get the level up.\n\nTheir Ultimate offers them a ton of additional kill pressure. Play smart and recall when you\u2019re low so Rakan cannot use their Ultimate to execute you.\n\nAs Rakan has a lot of built-in sustain, make sure you get some form of healing reduction quickly to make it easier for you to kill them.\n\nTo nullify all-in opportunities and diminish Rakan's trading potential, it is essential to maintain the wave closer to your side of the map, which will also aid in setting up your Jungler."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin may try to kick k somebody like the ADC into his teammates. Group close together to make it harder for him to kick a carry into the arms of his team.\n\nAs Lee Sin needs to get onto someone in order to kick them towards his team, locking him down with CC as soon as he engages is ideal as he is rather squishy and will be unable to escape if he\u2019s CC chained. \n\nLee Sin is really good at taking down or picking off isolated targets. Make sure you group closer to your team to make it harder for him to take anyone down whose alone."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level six is the 'power spike' for Teemo. It will let him be extraordinarily obnoxious and sneaky now, especially as the game progresses.\n\nThe first item component will increase his overall damage in the game. This will help him in duels and will allow him to use his spells frequently as well.\n\nMultiple items in the first ability will increase the damage and reduce the cooldown of the said ability. It can allow Teemo to do a lot of burst damage.        "}
{"text": "As annie, Take control of the lane brushes and keep poking the enemy champions with your Q and W. You should easily be able to zone enemies off doing this.\n\nThe first item component is a significant power spike in this game. It will give Annie the incentive to use more spells and poke the enemy relentlessly to help her ADC.\n\nHer most significant power spike is when she obtains her Ultimate R. She can easily burst people down and roam to other lanes using her E after stacking up her Passive.        "}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus doesn\u2019t want to fight in the early game. Instead, he wants to focus on farming and stacking his Q. Try to fight him when he is focused on stacking as he may focus on the farm rather than fighting you- which will allow you to gain a health advantage. \n\nDo not push Nasus under his turret as it allows him to farm safely. Instead, freeze the lane towards your side of the map so he has to overextend for farm.\n\nOnce Nasus has some levels behind him and has multiple points in his W, he will have good gank set up. You\u2019ll need to play safer if the wave is closer to his side of the map during this time so you don\u2019t die from ganks."}
{"text": "As nautilus, To maintain parity in the laning phase, aim to hit level 2 at the same time as Nautilus. This ensures that you and your ADC have access to your full abilities and can better respond to any aggression from the enemy duo.\n\nWhenever Nautilus roams, be proactive in pinging and communicating with your team. Alert them to his absence from the lane, as he can be a potent force in ganking other lanes. This allows your teammates to play more defensively and avoid potential engages or roams from Nautilus.\n\nWhen you are detached from your ADC, be mindful of your positioning to avoid getting hooked by Nautilus's Q. Position yourself behind minions or out of range to minimize the risk of being caught and engaged upon.\n\nTake advantage of your range advantage as Yuumi when Nautilus's Q is on cooldown. During this window, you can safely poke and harass him with your abilities. However, always be mindful of your positioning, as Nautilus can punish mispositioning with his crowd control abilities."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao will have two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. It will allow him to use the ability more often, making it easier for him to convert fights into a 1 v 1 as and when required.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out by the time he hits level 9. This is a crucial power spike as it massively increases his damage output and dueling capacity.\n\nXin is excellent in team fights and picking of enemies due to his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to single out enemies, allowing him to be immune from ranged carries.        "}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus' level 6 is a significant power spike as he can actually properly duel with enemies now. It will give him a massive advantage when dealing with enemy laners who are pushed up and run down by him.\n\nNasus is very weak early on and can be bullied hard due to the lack of HP and stacks on his Q. His main goal will be to farm and stack up to decimate the opposition during the later parts of the game.\n\nNasus' first item will give him a damage and survivability boost in the lane. It will bring him one step closer to achieving his most potent form in the game, but he should still focus on farming and stacking up his Q."}
{"text": "As aatrox, The first significant peak of Aatrox is at level 3 when it has access to all its basic abilities. This will allow it to go for favorable trades. Once Aatrox has obtained its first component element, it will be able to go for favorable trades. Look to play more aggressive once you get your first component element. When Aatrox has obtained its ultimate R; its death pressure increases considerably. Additional damage and healing that it gets from this ability can help it start a snowball."}
{"text": "As rakan, Level 2 is the power peak all in place for Rakan. It should use track brushes and work with its ADC to get a murder early. Level 6 will be another decent peak for Rakan. It can now multiple CC targets and chain with its W for a big knockup. Boots are a massive peak to its roaming ability in the game. It should seek to make games all around the card."}
{"text": "As malphite, Try to go a lot during this phase of the game. In addition, work with your Jungler when you can make sure that you can secure choices with your Ultimate h. Get your first element will help you a lot in the game. Make sure you keep hitting enemies with your d and then go to kill it with your Ultimate h. Participate in as many team fights as you can. This will allow you to kill multiple targets with your Ultimate h, especially in piled fights."}
{"text": "As azir, When no team fights are occurring, put yourself in a side lane and look to split push and farm side waves. Watch what your team is doing in case you need to move to help them at all times.\n\nDelay team fights for as long as possible while you try to harass the enemy with your long-ranged r and auto-attacks.\n\nUse your Ultimate R defensively in team fights. Use it to protect yourself and your allies from the enemy frontline/assassins."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 16 isn't that great a spike as it will only increase the damage of the ability and reduce the cooldown. It won't provide any utility whatsoever.\n\nHe will fall off later during the game due to the enemy purchasing defensive items. He should still rely on picks to get kills all around the map.\n\nMost of his abilities will be maxed out during this phase of the game. He can look for picks all around the map and can set up death brushes in the Jungle."}
{"text": "As lillia, Lillia\u2019s early game is rather weak. She needs to hit level 6 as fast as possible to make her ganks more effective.\n\nAs Lillia is usually built AP, she will struggle against teams that have high burst damage. She also struggles against poke and disengage, which can make team fighting difficult for her. \n\nWhile her Ultimate R is a great team fighting tool, it does take some time to come into effect. Your allies can also disrupt your damage if they deal damage to a sleepy target."}
{"text": "As kled, Kled's Passive is highly underestimated, but it will make all the difference in the game now. He can use it to absorb so much damage without risk of dying, and he can quickly get up if Skaarl runs away. Kled will have its construction almost finished now. This means that he will be tanky, as well as flattening heavy amounts of damage. Anyone getting caught by him will probably die. Since all his abilities will be maximized at this stage, Kled will be huge in the game. His ability to disrupt the ranks of enemy teams will be phenomenal, and he can easily peel for his wears as well."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, In team fights, use your authorized E to get choices to start the fight. Catching someone and then getting a murder could provide your team with enough time to take the Baron or Dragon. As a non-orthodox support, you could have more deaths than your ADC after the laning phase. You can engage in split thrust or agriculture in a side lane if the Allied ADC is not too effective and will not increase. Peel for your team in team fights. Use your Q on the nearest champion to protect you and your ADC."}
{"text": "As xerath, Stand outsdie of the minion wave as much as possible. It will force the Xerath to choose between pushing and poke you.\n\nMatch his pushing power.

{"text": "As illaoi, Illaoi will often push quickly with her Q. Stand outside of the minion wave whenever possible so she is unable to push the wave and poke you at the same time. Making her choose between pushing and poking will help you in this lane.\n\nUnless you can dodge all of her Tentacles, the difference between killing or dying to Illaoi is from the healing off of her Tentacles, so try to buy some form of grievous wounds as soon as possible.\n\nWithout her Tentacles, Illaoi dueling power diminishes fairly. Be proactive by destroying them when possible.\n\nUsing your Q will lock you in place for a short while and Illaoi players will try to capitalize on this with a quick Q. Use your Q to poke or farm when you know her Q is on cooldown or if she is out of range."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is really easy to kite. As he is immobile, champions with dashes, range advantage or poke make it difficult for Darius to get on to them and kill them.\n\nHe falls off in the late game. Darius is an early to mid game champion and once it gets to the later stages of the game, his strengths become weaknesses.\n\nHis Ultimate e is crucial in team fights to take down key targets.

{"text": "As rengar, Another point in his Ultimate R will increase his pick potential. He can easily lane gank the enemy laners and accumulate leads.\n\nHe will now have multiple items at his disposal.

He should be able to win multiple fights and zone off enemies by using his Ultimate R correctly.        "}
{"text": "As jax, Jax's W being maxed out at level nine is a superpower spike for him. He can take frequent fights and take little to no damage. In addition, the CC aspect will allow him to score many picks throughout the game.\n\nHis mid-game is not as weak as his early game because he will have his core items and can use his Passive pretty well. He will also be a part of many objective fights, allowing him to land a multi-man E stun on the enemies. His E can also be used to make cheeky plays using the lane brushes and lack of vision.\n\nOnce he gets two points in his Ultimate R, he will become mighty during team fights. This is because his survivability will increase, which will increase the amount of consistent damage dealt by him with his auto-attacks."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton is one of the first strongest game champions in the game. You can use this advantage to win an advance. To tons of support in the way thanks to his e.

{"text": "As rumble, Can do a lot of damage to enemy units with his Passive empowered Q and E who are close to him. This makes it easy for him to act as a disruptor during team fights.\n\nHis E combined with his W can allow him to run down a single enemy target easily. The W shield allows him to mitigate a good amount of poke as well.\n\nHis Ultimate makes him a menace during team fights. The enemy team can\u2019t afford to fight in closed spaces or they will definitely get chunked out by his Ultimate"}
{"text": "As anivia, Anivia has one of the strongest Passives in the game. It can prevent her from dying which offers her tons of extra protection throughout the game.\n\nThanks to your Wall e, Anivia has a lot of utility that can protect her and her allies. It can also increase her chances of surviving in skirmishes. It is really versatile and can also block the enemy off from entering a certain part of the map.\n\nWith your Ultimate m, Anivia\u2019s sieging power is incredibly strong. With lots of mana, you can constantly push the enemy into the enemies Tower and force them to stay in the lane."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius can start crashing as soon as he reaches level 3. He needs all of his basic capabilities before starting to gank. His best early-playing power peak is when he reaches level 6. His ultimate e greatly increases his 1v1 power and escarment and he will be a huge threat at that time. After completing his first component element, Darius trading and killing pressure further increases. He can 1v1 most enemy Junglers at that time."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, This champion is an early game bully. Play aggressive throughout the laning phase to get kills. If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate n is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate n is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As leona, Stay together with your team. Do not leave your ADCs, otherwise the enemy will capitalize on the fact that you are not there to protect your ADC. Peel for your carts in the team fights. After using your e and k, retreat and protect your allies and focus the closest champion. Look for choices with your Ultimate e. If you can catch someone when the enemy is not organized, you can force a team fight or a goal after."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Very strong when the enemy is pushed up and a new wave of minions is approaching. This allows him to use his E to catch up his enemy lantern and then hit them with his r. Yasuo can quite easily set up ganks with this tactic as well. Playing around the W can allow him to completely dismantle the various enemy matches. He can run around the windshield and save himself from a lot of damage in this way. Aglaist melee champions, it is always wise to retreat and maintain a certain distance from them. After six, he becomes extremely strong due to his Ultimate R crowd control as well as the penetration of the bonus armor he gets on the use."}
{"text": "As lillia, Keep playing with your Ultimate R to get more dead and more choices. Choosing the right target can allow you to take the Baron or Dragon.

{"text": "As amumu, As Aumu has 2 s, it can easily catch one of the enemy corridors as they walk outside of Aumu. First power peak is when it unlocks its Ultimate y. Level 6 is crucial, and you have to hit it as soon as possible to help your allies. Once Aumu has finished its first element, it will be much more robust and more threatening on the Summoners Rift. Make sure you find a healthy balance between glove and agriculture so as not to delay your first item."}

Additionally, it works really well when his target is the one who must go near the enemies to attack them.\n\nAt level 9, his Q will be completely maxed out. This will give a massive boost to his damage and wave clear. In addition, he can now help other laners out frequently and keep his wave shoved in at all times.

Get your allies forward by gauntling each time your Ultimate is high as it will always result in a murder or blown flash. Your objective control is quite high. Try to secure the Dragon or Rift Herald whenever you can. You need to keep Hecarim away from your teammates so make sure to use your Ultimate at CC Hecarim so your team can kill him. If you can't against Gank Hecarim, steal his camps. You can't just allow him to accumulate benefits and play passively."}

Disengage as soon as you see her channel her Ultimate R."}

If Trundle falls behind early after a bad game, it will really be difficult for him to get back in the game as he will be behind in gold and XP. Trundle needs to play aggressive early. If he can, then Trundle won't be as strong as he could be. You choose Trundle for early aggression and make coins."}
{"text": "As masteryi, His e et e allows him to drop the aggro tower and take reduced damage to the tower respectively. Is a monster of scale, and if he manages to get his articles and hit the middle of the game, he will be almost unstoppable. For a squishy champion, he can a-man the Baron if he is in front. His Ultimate r can completely move the tide of a fight if he is not controlled. This allows him to use his e frequently, which allows him to avoid CC. Combined with his Wuju Style, he inflicts a lot of damage."}
{"text": "Against sylas, To make it difficult for Sylas to land his E on you, always make sure to be behind at least 1 minion so that he can not land the CC on you. If Sylas is able to reach you, try to disengage as quickly as possible. A lot of Sylas damage is inflicted when it is on you. Try to stay within the maximum range as much as possible to make it harder to reach you. Sylas really has good card pressure and can err with ease. If he has left the track and started wandering, communicate with your team and push it in to deny him gold and XP."}
{"text": "As syndra, During this phase, take as many team fights as possible and always try to fight close to bottlenecks to maximize your stunning potential E.

{"text": "As ziggs, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in the way. You have a lot of poke, so try poke the enemy down as often as you can. Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your Q. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}

If the enemy has lacklustre ultimates, Sylas won\u2019t be able to do much.\n\nIf used improperly, his W can get him killed due to him getting displaced to another location. If the enemy purchases Grievous Wounds, they can easily counter this heal by a good amount.\n\nProper vision placement can ruin his chances of being able to flank the enemy team with his E. He won\u2019t be able to effectively impact a fight when he can\u2019t flank the enemy team."}

You are also not as effective if you aren't able to accumulate a lead on your enemies early on.\n\nRegardless of the additional movement speed your E offers, Annie has little to no form of escape. If you\u2019re overextended without your E to protect you, you will be an easy target."}

{"text": "Against rakan, Rakan has a strong level 1. Watch your positioning as he may look for an aggressive play at level 1 with his W and force you to blow a Summoner Spell. Similarly, watch out for his level 2 all-in.\n\nWhen Rakan has purchased Mobility Boots, his roaming potential increases substantially. Ping whenever he goes missing as he is a very good roaming champion.\n\nRakan is really good in the mid-game and in team fights. Expect him to engage as soon as somebody walks out of position."}
{"text": "As fizz, When no team fights are occurring, split push and draw the enemies attention to you while your team sieges or makes plays on the other side of the map.\n\nFizz is really good at getting picks with his Ultimate R. Look to catch out enemies who are alone or who are too far forward.\n\nLook to fight anybody who tries to stop you from split pushing or farming in a side lane. You\u2019re a strong 1v1 champion and as long as they\u2019re not a tank, you should be able to fight them."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Poke the enemy and harass them as much as you can before looking to fight. Bursting someone down with a few Q\u2019s and your Ultimate R will allow you to force a team fight with the numbers or health advantage.\n\nAvoid using your E aggressively in late-game fights as you\u2019ll be vulnerable briefly. Only use it aggressively if you\u2019re 100% sure you cannot get abused for it.\n\nStick with your team and avoid walking too far away from them. If you get caught out, your team will lose out on a lot of damage in a team fight, and it would be your fault. Stick with your team as much as possible."}
{"text": "As singed, It is quite weak before reaching level six. It is because it does not have much mobility, and enemies can easily get away from it if they have a vision of it. After six, Singed gets a massive boost in its power because it gets a team struggle impacting Ultimate n. It allows it to ride around and get ganks as well. The first element will give a boost to its survival and overall damage. It will be able to use its l for a prolonged period as well."}
{"text": "As drmundo, As the game progresses and it gets its basic elements, it will be able to inflict damage, as well as absorb a lot of damage for its team in the front line. This allows it to inflict damage freely. It can be a good initiator with its Q and R. Its ultimate R prevents it from dying or getting shot quickly. It is at its strongest when it is with its team because it will get a lot of follow-up damage and will be able to help its team get killed."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Trading against Heimerdinger can be extremely tedious, but it can be done. Removing his Turrets Q will be the main focus for poke or trading with him. When you use your skill shots (if they are AOE), try to target them so that they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q. This will allow you to clean them up more easily and increase your death pressure in the way. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, his death pressure and strength increase considerably. Keep this in mind and attention to his abilities empowered."}
{"text": "Against azir, Azir will try and delay a team fight and poke you down with his W as much as possible before his team initiates. Don\u2019t let him poke you down by starting the fight as soon as possible rather than delaying it.\n\nCC is your best friend to counter his engage and the Shurima Shuffle. If he goes in, try and CC him as fast as possible to shut him down and prevent him from pushing your team towards his.\n\nAfter his first back, Azir is going to be pushing constantly. Try and pick champions that have kill pressure and can match his wave clear so you do not lose your Tower early on."}
{"text": "As galio, Keep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them after they have used a capacity as they can not use it to trade with. Galio is less of a threat when they have a capacity down. Think twice before using your dash in this matchup. If you dash forward, they could all within you, or the enemy Jungle might appear. Look what is happening on the map before dipping forward. Make sure to hit level 2 before Galio so that you can abuse your level 2 all-in to get an early lead."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 11 is not too suitable because it can only move and play games. It will reduce the cooldown but do nothing else. It starts to come online in the middle of the game. Its burst damage is very important, and it can quickly get choices with its abilities. Its first ability will be maximized at level 9. It can do a lot of damage now, especially when fighting near objective pits or choking points."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Hard engage is the best way to deal with Ezreal during the laning phase. But you\u2019ll need to wait for him to use his E if your CC is a skill shot.\n \nEzreals poke damage starts stacking up if you take too many Q\u2019s to the face. Ensure you\u2019re always stood behind the minion wave at all times.\n \nIn team fights, you mustn\u2019t let Ezreal poke you down before you get the chance to engage. If he\u2019s isolated, run at him as quickly as you can to start the fight. Do not delay team fights against an Ezreal."}
{"text": "As xerath, Harass the enemy throughout the laning phase with your p and 2. Your goal is to constantly harass the enemy whenever possible and get murders. After destroying the tower of the lower lane, turn to the medium track and try to take this tower. This will open the map and give your team a gold advance. Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the goal to make it easier to secure the tower of the medium track. Every time your Ultimate 2 is up, try to use it on enemy travellers to get their weak health. Ideally, harass them first before using it to make it easier for you to kill the enemy."}
{"text": "Against alistar, At level 1, make sure to harass Alistar with basic attacks to get his weak health before reaching level 2. His level 2 all-in is strong enough, so you should try to get a health advantage to make it impossible for him to engage. Once level 6, Alistar can engage freely and trick dive with his Ultimate. If you are below 50% of health, make sure you can remember how easily he can dive and survive thanks to his R. Once Alistar takes Mobi Boots, he can wander and help other ways. As soon as he leaves the track, ping that he is missing. Communication is the key and you need to communicate with your teammates when he's gone."}
{"text": "Against zoe, Zoe\u2019s range increases on her Q and E once she hits level 6. At this time, her kill pressure will also increase. Whenever her E is up, play safer.\n\nHer damage output increases dramatically once she has her first item completed. She\u2019ll also be able to clear waves very easily. Stand behind the minion wave at all times.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Zoe becomes. In particular, she is very good in the mid-game and her pick potential is incredibly strong."}
{"text": "As rumble, Another point in his Ultimate b will seriously tip team fights in chokepoints into his favor. All he needs to do is time it well and drop it at the proper places.\n\nHe will now have multiple items at his disposal. This means that his damage will increase significantly, and he should have an easy time melting through enemy health bars.\n\nRumble's presence during mid-game fights is really fabulous. He should be able to win multiple fights just by using his Ultimate b properly.        "}
{"text": "Against zilean, Zilean is super squishy. Focus him rather than the enemy ADC in lane to increase your chances of getting kills.\n\nOnce Zilean is level 6, it will be harder for you to get kills in lane. Whenever his Ultimate t  is down, try to abuse him to get kills. One way of killing him when his Ultimate t is up is by locking him down with CC so he is unable to use it on himself.\n\nWhen looking to trade, try and bait out his Q before initiating a fight. This will make it impossible for him to CC you if the first Q misses. "}
{"text": "Against nilah, Keep the wave closer to your side of the map early. It will protect you from its all-in. Respect its level 6 peak power. It can quickly kill you when it gets the level up. It is also important to remember that it will hit level 6 before you. If you can, invest in an execution early. It will help to reduce its maintenance and make the laning against it easier."}
{"text": "Against kaisa, Once Kai\u2019Sa has her upgraded Q, her damage output will be incredibly strong. Do not disrespect her damage output once she has it upgrades, and avoid fighting her in a 1v1 as she will always beat you.\n\nWhen Kai\u2019Sa has multiple upgrades, she will be very difficult to fight against.\n\nAt level 6, Kai\u2019Sa gains extra utility thanks to her Ultimate R. Make sure you watch the map when recalling so she is unable to snipe you with her W and follow up with her Ultimate R. "}
{"text": "As gwen, In the first few levels, play safe and avoid committing to any trades. Your very early game is rather weak, so you\u2019ll probably lose trades versus an aggressive laner.\n\nOnce your Passive is stacked, you can look for fights with the enemy. Looking for skirmishes when your Passive is stacked will increase your damage output and increase your chances of killing the enemy.\n\nFocus on good wave management and going for favourable trades. If you are constantly pushing, you will not be able to get kills as your W  doesn\u2019t protect you against tower shots."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Make sure you\u2019re never near a wall otherwise Poppy will be able to use her E and push you into it.\n\nWhenever Poppy throws her Buckler and it lands near you, try to step on it. However, do not over commit to destroying it as she may use your positioning to play aggressive.\n\nPost 6 it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to kill Poppy as she will probably use her Ultimate R to knock you away. Keep this in mind and hold on to any CC abilities until she starts the channel."}
{"text": "As seraphine, During the middle of the game, your goal will be to be clear and get the priority of the track. The middle lane would certainly be better for you, but don't forget to show up for the skirmishes. Use your ultimate R very carefully, as it can be the decisive factor when it comes to winning a fight. Use the ability of multiple CC targets and chain it with your E CC. Fighting around closed spaces will help you a lot because you can easily target several champions. Your ultimate R and E should be quite easy to land."}
{"text": "As ekko, His W allows him to engage upon a group or enemy champions, or a single enemy champion with ease. This is really beneficial if he can land it from out of vision and then use his E to dash into the W circle to guarantee the stun.\n\nHis burst damage is not to be ignored as the game goes on. This is especially true when he happens to be ahead in the game. He can quite literally take the enemy backline out in one rotation of spells, if he manages to W E onto them.\n\nHis Ultimate R is the most powerful ability in his kit as it allows him to undo his mistakes, especially when he chooses a bad fight or fails an all-in. As the game goes on, the cooldown of this ability becomes shorter, allowing him to do whatever he pleases as long as he has his Ultimate R up."}
{"text": "Against zoe, Keep on the opposite of the path at any time. This will make it harder for her to land her Q and E. Make sure you're still behind the minion wave and not inside. As Zoe-Q deals AOE damage, you'll take damage if you're near the minion line. When you trade, keep an eye on what fate (if any) Zoe has picked up. If it's an aggressive spell, expect her to look for a job. If it's Flash, expect her to be more mobile and if it's a defensive spell, it'll be harder for you to kill her."}
{"text": "As malphite, It will now have its core of articles, which means that its d and Ultimate h should hit like a truck at the moment. Several points in its Ultimate h will allow it to use capacity frequently, make peaks, and land multi-man Ultimate h on enemies fighting near choking points. Malphite is pretty good during team fighting. It can damage many enemies at once and do it through vision, giving the enemy a small window to react."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, Nautilus is a good early game Jungler. He can start ganking very quickly as he has so many CC tools in his kit. Vision will make it harder for him to get successful ganks off.\n\nNautilus doesn\u2019t have the greatest objective control early. Try and secure the Drakes before he gets an opportunity to gank his bot lane and rotate to it afterwards.\n\nAs he will be ganking a lot early, try to counter gank if you can. If you can\u2019t, try and invade him, gank another lane or secure the Dragon/Rift Herald."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Do not group closely together when sieging an objective or team fighting as it provides Gragas with an opportunity to knock your whole team into his with his Ultimate R.\n\nWhen fighting, make sure you\u2019re not too far forward or split from your team. If you\u2019re too far forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught out like this could result in the enemy taking an objective shortly afterwards. \n\nYou can often tell Gragas is nearby when Predator kicks in. As soon as you see the marker, retreat to safety so you don\u2019t get killed. Having deep vision around the map to spot him early will also come in handy."}
{"text": "As teemo, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Stay with your team at the end of the game. Don't separate or stay away from them; otherwise, the enemy can try to take you or launch a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus on the only rear line, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "Against skarner, Place vision in unusual warding locations outside of the river. This will help you spot Skarner before he can use his E.\n\nDelay his level 6 power spike by invading his jungle and stealing away his camps. His Ultimate is a very strong tool, and delaying it for as long as possible is key.\n\nHe has good objective control. Make sure you keep objectives warded at all times so you can spot him before he can take it.\n"}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, If the enemy team focuses on destroying its Q turrets before invading it, it will have to play defensively until it can bring back its turrets. Missing its E will put it in a vulnerable place, especially if it is laning on its own or when it is pushed upwards. This error can easily cause it to kill. It is very effective when fighting in closed spaces like the Jungle. The enemy can reduce this by fighting in the tracks and then matching its thrust if he tries to divide the thrust."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Vel'Koz's level 6 is a massive powerpike because it allows it to fully use its passive. It is a great finishing capacity that is best used against enemies that are taken together. Its first element will give a massive boost to its overall efficiency in the way. It will increase its combo of brilliant damage, and it can force enemies to suddenly remember quite frequently in the way. The more points in its Q, the more its poke potential and the overall production of damage."}
{"text": "Against shaco, If your team is grouped and you don't have a vision on Shaco, make sure you have a scan and vision lens around you, then you will be alerted if Shaco tries to jump and assassinate a port. Don't hunt Shaco because he can lure you to run in his Boxes x or to his team. Shaco will try to assassinate sketched targets that move around the card alone. You can prevent this by playing as a team and avoiding walking in non-paid areas if you don't know where he was."}
{"text": "As neeko, Level six is an important peak for Neeko as it gains access to its Ultimate R power. Team fighting will become really easy now. Its early play is pretty decent because it can get the enemies out of the range. Its E will be empowered if it can properly manipulate the minion wave. The first component will allow it to spam capabilities and not lack mana. It will also allow it to do a lot of damage in the way."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, It can keep the enemy pushed in their turn at the beginning of the game that allows it as well as its ADC to get turn plates early. Heimerdinger can often prevent the ganks alone by having 3 turrets Q up because it is difficult enough for a gank Jungler when it is surrounded by them. Heimer has tons of poke throughout the laning phase with his Q and W. He also has a good business configuration with his E too."}
{"text": "As xerath, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in the way. You have a lot of poke, so try poke the enemy as often as you can. Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your 2. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in. Once you have hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Make sure you\u2019re only using your abilities when you have to; especially your E. Aatrox suffers from long cooldowns and is easily abusable when they\u2019re on cooldown.\n\nYou\u2019ll fall off in the later stages of the game. Try and end the game as quickly as you can or snowball your lead so you\u2019ll be a huge threat in team fights.\n\nAatrox is not an easy champion to learn. He has a unique mechanic on his Q which does take some time getting used to. You\u2019ll need to put in a lot of practice to master this champion."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen will gain a huge peak of power and finishing ability once he reaches level 6. This will let him go to regular short-blank exchanges against his enemies, leave his passive kick after the trade, and then go to the finish with his Ultimate R after having obtained the low enemy. In addition, the use of the track brushes to hide Garen's approach will further strengthen his position in the track. Garen's first element will either allow him to survive the track for a longer time (tank building) or significantly increase his damage (burner building). The first will allow him to take part in many team fights while the second will help him with duels."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, It has a lot of poke damage built in its kit. Its s is the most heinous because it helps it both poke and wakelear at the same time. This allows it to freely push the way and get damage as well. Its d makes a completely versatile champion and provides it with subsistence in the form of mana. It can even set up kills for its team with its gold card. Its Ultimate makes it the king of macro as it can use it to be present in any team fight, even if it happens to be on the other side of the map. It also allows it to detect each enemy champion on the map, which is very beneficial for its team."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Peel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nDo not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss on the CC it provides."}
{"text": "As shaco, Shaco's Level 1 is a decent time to install its boxes around the track and catch the enemies out of sight. Few Supports will take Sweeper first, so it should have a gala in the bot track. Level 6 is a massive power peak as it can now bait the enemies and bother them massively during the fighting. It can easily control it from the vision and make the enemies believe that it is the real Shaco they have to do. Its first element will give it a boost of massive damage and allow it to quickly shoot down the enemies. It can also get several murders while wandering around the map."}
{"text": "As syndra, Level 6 is a massive power peak for Syndra because it can easily shoot down enemies now. It also allows it to use its E correctly. The first element will give it a lot of apparent wave and damage. It will also give it a lot of mana to throw away its abilities frequently. Level 3 is a decent peak of power because it allows it to access all its primary capabilities. It also allows it to go to regular exchanges against its enemies."}
{"text": "As lillia, Your goal in the early game is to gain as much gold and XP as quickly as you can. Power farm and gank lanes that are over extended to increase your gold income.\n\nLook to secure objectives as often as possible. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes along.\n\nYour Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Whenever it is up, try to use it to help your allies get kills."}
{"text": "As neeko, Very squishy and can be easily gotten rid of if she is CC\u2019d. This is especially true if she is going for the AD build.\n\nCan\u2019t be very effective if the enemy sets proper vision around and can notice Neeko changing her forms or hiding in a brush to land her E.\n\nDue to her pushing power, she can be very susceptible to ganks especially after she has used up her W."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 16 isn't that great as it bolsters her roaming potential and nothing else. No additional damage is dealt by her due to that added point in her Ultimate R.\n\nShe will be dealing a lot of consistent burst damage during this phase of the game. All she needs to do is maintain her positioning and just land her abilities.\n\nHer late-game fighting is really potent. She can knock back multiple enemies and prevent enemies from coming too close to an objective pit during significant fights."}
{"text": "As swain, Stay with your team during the middle of the game. You're not strong enough to stay alone. Make sure you're always with your ADC at least. Place the vision around the main goals before the objective scares. Use your W to help you spot enemies so you don't have to check them. Look for choices with your team on isolated targets."}
{"text": "As viktor, All its capabilities will be upgraded during this phase of the game, which will make it sub-powerful. Its capabilities will hit like a truck from now on. Several articles will also allow it to inflict more damage to enemies, especially those who cling together during the team fights. A maximum of Ultimate m will massively hurt the enemy team. Any type of fight around the bottlenecks will automatically make Viktor the winner."}
{"text": "As fiora, Split push and draw the enemies attention to you while your team sieges a nearby objective.\n\nTry to pick someone off at the start of the fight. If you\u2019re able to get a pick and heal your team with your Ultimate R quickly, the chances of winning the fight will be higher.\n\nWhenever your TP is down or if your team isn\u2019t very strong alone, stick with them and fight as 5 rather than playing split."}
{"text": "As briar, Make sure you get to level 3 really fast in this game. It will allow you to run ganks easily and get a quick advance on the enemy. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should look for peaks all around the map. After getting your first element, you need to look for more fighting with the enemy Jungler or travelers to abuse your early strength."}
{"text": "As hwei, He will be stronger than you early, but once you have some levels under your belt you can start being a bit more aggressive.\n\nFocus on farming early and limit trading. Just poke if you can, but don\u2019t commit to anything.\n\nYou can start playing more aggressively after you hit level 6.\n\nWhen pushing, try to hit both the minion wave and Hwei at the same time."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Do not group very closely because it will allow Hecarim to get a multi-person Ultimate T that will help him and his teammates win the fight. Hecarims Ultimate T is about the same width as the paths inside the jungle. Try and avoid fighting in the jungle as it will allow him to get his Ultimate T on all your team. Hecarim can try to flank in team fights so he can get back with his Ultimate T."}
{"text": "As masteryi, He will focus mainly on cleaning during the start of the game. His e can easily be interrupted by any form of hard CC. This can make the lap divers risky and can get him killed almost instantly if he does not use the ability properly. Can't do a lot if the enemy team has just disengaged when his Ultimate R is active. Very sensitive to the CC, so if the enemy saves their CC for him, he will die."}
{"text": "Against trundle, Trundle is strong in the game very early in the role of Support. It expects it to go for the first games to move forward. At level 6, Trundle will be much stronger thanks to its Ultimate n. It will buff it and make it much more difficult to manage. Once it has bought boots, Trundle is the roaming potential and the overall pressure of the card increase."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, Stand outside of the minion wave at all times during the laning phase. Seraphine players will often use their Q (or empowered Q) to push the minion wave. By standing outside of the wave, she\u2019ll be unable to poke and push the wave at the same time.\n\nKeep an eye on how many empowered stacks she has. If she has 3, play safer as her next ability will be much stronger.\n\nOnce she hits level 6, expect her to either look for kills in lane or set up her Jungler for ganks. Her Ultimate R is a strong tool that offers her extra kill pressure."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, As Xin Zhao has a strong potential for invasion, it is crucial to monitor the entrances of your jungle so that you can spot them before they invade your jungle and kill you. Be careful that Xin Zhao is much stronger than you early. Keep this in mind, expect the gank often early, and you too. Don't let the enemy Jungler get all the Dragons. Try to secure them with your team after spoiling the lower lane. Make sure to focus on taking Dragons for your team. After spoiling the lower lane and turning immediately, you can take the first Dragon."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, Shyvana will try to delay a team fight so that she can harass you and harass you with her l in the shape of Dragon t.

Make sure you have your flanks watched so you can see her before she gets the chance to crash and shoot you."}
{"text": "As viego, Getting a complete build will allow your damage to skyrocket. Don't forget to use your Passive timely to avoid dying in clustered fights.\n\nYou can use your Ultimate R as an escape tool in heavily botched-up fights. This is not recommended because ability can allow you to turn a fight and save yourself almost immediately.\n\nYour E will be pivotal to fights during this phase of the game. Always try to flank the enemy and get kills on the backline. This way, you will be able to take over the game easily."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Don't regroup closely in an objective fight or team because it gives Gragas the opportunity to hit your entire team with his Ultimate R. In a fight, make sure you're not too forward or get away from your team. If you're too forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught like this could lead the enemy to take a goal soon after. Constantly try poke and harass Gragas. Having him in bad health will prevent him from playing or aggressively positioning himself."}
{"text": "As orianna, Using the lane brushes to land your d and d will be really easy for you in this matchup. Just make sure that you maintain your distance from the enemies at all costs.\n\nRemember that you can slow down enemies using your d.

{"text": "As zilean, It is an agricultural matchup. Focus on agriculture and just harass with your abilities. Stand outside the minion wave at all times.

{"text": "Against varus, Post 6, avoid extensing when you are defenseless. Varus. The Ultimate R can be used to catch you out of position and start a fight. Play safer whenever its Ultimate R is in place. Avoid standing inside the minion wave. This will allow Varus to poke and push the wave at the same time. Standing outside the minion wave will force him to choose between shovelling and poking with his Q. Varus will try his hardest for you poke out of the way. Try your hardest to avoid as much damage and abilities as possible. Opt for additional support if you can't dodge skill shots."}
{"text": "As lillia, She will be able to max out her Ultimate R at level 16. This will drastically impact team fights since her Ultimate R will be on a very short cooldown.\n\nLillia is excellent in late-game team fights. This is due to her AoE abilities and mobility, which can let her get a 5-man Ultimate R.\n\nLillia will have multiple items by now. Her damage output and prolonged burn damage will be really obnoxious for the enemy to deal with."}
{"text": "As teemo, All-in'ing Teemo is vital in this matchup as failing to do so will get you poked out significantly and you won't be able to do anything.\n\nThe lane will be riddled with traps in this matchup so it is vital that you use a Sweeper and purchase Control Wards.\n\nTeemo isn't really a massive threat but make sure that you pick him off every chance you get in this matchup. His Blind can be really obnoxious and prevent your ranged carries from doing anything in this matchup.\n\nKeep the wave close to the tower and focus on getting tankier in this matchup. Failing to do so can easily allow the enemy to all-in you."}
{"text": "Against kalista, The extended trades work in Kalista's favor. Try to keep the trades short and soft so that it can not inflict tons of damage with its r. Kalista will have the edge advantage against all the champions of melee. Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP to stay alive in the way. Take note of who Kalista has been paired. In many cases it will be either the Support or Jungler depending on the situation."}
{"text": "Against trundle, Stand in the middle of the track rather on the sides of the track. If you are standing around the edges near the wall, you will allow him to set up his Jungler with a quick and easy pillar e. As Trundle-S Passive regenerates health every time a minion dies, he will get a lot of additional support in the way. Try to get an early executor. Trundle calls to reduce his healing. Trundle is good at level 2 and 3. Avoid fighting him unless you are as strong as him, or if you have a lot of support too. He will be able to support you with every job if you engage with them early."}
{"text": "As akshan, This is the phase of the game where you will be dealing a ton of damage.

It will definitely help you with chunking out enemies who have already taken some damage.\n\nIf you have allies who have CC built into their kit, try to stick near them. You should always focus on the CC'd target and kill them when you get a chance. Also, if the enemy has an assassin, try to shadow them and see if you can get the kill on them if they assassinate your allies."}
{"text": "Against zac, The Zacs E can be used from afar to start the team fight. Make sure to keep your flanks by sipping a goal. Avoid fighting in the jungle as it will be easier for Zac to land his E and hit your entire team with his Ultimate R. Fight in the open if possible. Do not regroup too closely. If you are slightly separated, it will be impossible for Zac to catch up and hit your entire team with his E and Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against twitch, Don't hang on or stay tight in the team fights against Twitch while her Spray and Pray c will melt you. Spread out and look for a way to blow it up once it turns out. Twitch will often get close to your team after coming out of its s. Once he has left it, try to shoot it as quickly as you can."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, At level six, Kog'Maw will gain access to his Ultimate y. This is important as the poke damage is really beneficial in taking down low on health enemies. This damage is further amplified if Kog'Maw goes for the AP build or a hybrid build.\n\nHis first item component will give him a damage boost and take more trades in the lane. He will have to be careful about over-extending and being caught out, though.\n\nAdding multiple points in his e will allow him to dish out a lot of damage in a short time. This helps a lot when it comes to slowing and damaging enemies, especially the ones who are immobile.        "}
{"text": "As zyra, By reducing its health, you can create pressure and limit its ability to freely use its capabilities. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to create opportunities for your gank jungler. This forces Zyra to expand, making it more vulnerable to ganks and reducing its ability to escape effectively. Be careful when facing Zyra at level 6, as its pressure to kill increases considerably. Adjust your game style to be more defensive and play safer during this phase of the game. Avoid detaching yourself from your ADC when Zyra's (Grasping Roots) ability is on the rise, as it can interrupt your W (You and Me!). Being caught without your W can leave you vulnerable and likely to be eliminated."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Try to secure the peaks during this phase of the game whenever possible. You will begin to fall, so you must avoid 5 v 5 team fights when possible. Keep track of the enemy Jungler and remain almost neutral as much as possible. You do not want to be spotted on the other side of the map and lose a crucial goal out of nowhere. Use the fog of the war to flank the enemy whenever possible. The goal is to get rid of the enemy carries as quickly as you can. You can also opt for a tanky construction and act as a front line if necessary."}
{"text": "As twitch, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle track and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently."}
{"text": "Against sylas, To make it hard for Sylas to land his E on you, always make sure you\u2019re behind at least 1 minion so he cannot land the CC on you.\n\nIf Sylas is able to get on to you, try to disengage as quickly as you can. A lot of Sylas\u2019 damage is dealt when he is on top of you. Try and stay at max range as much as possible to make it harder for him to get on to you.\n\nSylas has really good map pressure and can roam with ease. If he has left lane and started roaming, communicate with your team and push him in to deny him gold and XP."}
{"text": "As malzahar, He will have his core items by now, which means he will have a lot of mana and spam his Q and W.\n\nMultiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability frequently and make crucial picks. His silence will be invaluable as well.\n\nMalzahar is quite good during team fights as he can silence enemies and can lockdown high-priority targets effortlessly.        "}
{"text": "As tryndamere, 3 points in his Ultimate e will not be an excellent power spike. This is because it only ensures his prolonged survivability and nothing else.\n\nHe will be dealing a lot of damage during the later parts of the game. This is since he will have multiple items and will be able to duel anyone.\n\nHis late-game scaling is phenomenal, and he can one-shot squishy enemies after slowing them down and catching up to them. It will give him a pivotal role in the game."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Level sixteen is the most essential power spike for Kassadin. This allows him to use his Ultimate k frequently, which can cause a lot of mayhem in the enemy team.\n\nKassadin will be dealing a lot of damage during this phase of the game. It will let him take off huge chunks off the enemy's health bars, which will allow him to win the game for his team.\n\nHis presence in team fights will be really high, especially if he manages to get a flank on the enemy team. His ability to barge in, burst enemies down, and get away is phenomenal."}
{"text": "As ivern, Look for choices during the middle of the game with Daisy R. If you can catch someone out of position and take them down, you will be able to abuse the advantage of numbers. As Ivern is a support, make sure you are always with your team so you can help them when needed. Peel for your team in team fighting. Use Daisy R to peel for your team while focusing on using your W to protect your transport."}
{"text": "As renata, Very strong Ultimate R which can allow her to hit 5 enemy champions at once.\n\nHer W can be very strong if it\u2019s put on the right champion.\n\nCan give multiple members of her team a shield with her E.\n"}
{"text": "As lux, Once she gets multiple items, she will be bursting down enemies left, right, and center. All she needs to do is sit in the fog of war and wait for an unsuspecting enemy to walk in on her.\n\nAt level 16, Lux will mega-spike. This is due to her Ultimate n being upgraded to level three. She will now blow up enemies with the Ultimate n alone, and the ability's cooldown will be negligible.\n\nHer g will be on a very low cooldown now, and the Jungle will be her playground. She can easily catch and burst down squishy targets who are squandering around in their Jungle."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Its first major power peak is at level 6 as it gets access to its Ultimate R. It will be really strong at this stage of the game. Once it has finished its first component, its trading ability increases sharply. Beware of trading if it gets its first component before you. It is good in team fights thanks to the AOE on its Ultimate R. It will be good when the enemies are grouped closely together."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is one of the first strongest game champions in the game. You can use this advantage to gain an early lead. Extended trades work in favor of Darius thanks to his passive. He will win almost all automatic attack battles. This makes him a great duelist in the bottom ELO as many players like to fight constantly. Is really good in team fights thanks to his Ultimate e that can be reset if he gets the shot of death with her."}
{"text": "As anivia, At level 11, Anivia will have 2 points in her Ultimate m. Not only will it significantly increase its damage production, but it will be difficult for the enemy to sit all the goals because it can easily erase the wave. Anivia is good in team fighting, and the middle of the game is usually when the teams start to regroup. This makes her a good mid-game champion."}
{"text": "As zed, Make sure you reach level 3 really fast in this game. It will allow you to run ganks easily and get a quick lead on the enemy. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to blow up your opposition regularly. Look for peaks all around the map and keep a trace of recently completed fighting. Once you get your first element, your brilliant damage will be really high. Just make sure you don't get CC'd for a big all-in, you will definitely end up dying."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Try to delay team fights as long as possible while you poke the enemy down with your Barrels E. Getting a good Barrel E off can help you win the fight.\n\nAvoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. It is a very important ability and you need to make sure it\u2019s up before committing to a fight.\n\nWhile Gangplank does have a lot of splitting power, it\u2019s better for you to group with your team in the late game as there are strengths in numbers."}
{"text": "As janna, Janna will gain a huge advantage when she gets her boots. It not only makes her move faster, but it offers extra roaming potential which can assist her in helping her other laners.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike because she can now heal up her entire team during team fights. The knockback is quite beneficial as the last-ditch disengage tool as well.\n\nJanna is a monster during the early game and is very oppressive in the lane due to her d. She should use the lane brushes to amplify this effect and make laning very difficult for her enemies."}

Swain is easy to kill early if he is over extended.\n\nInvest in some form of healing reduction to make killing him easier early on.\n"}
{"text": "Against twitch, Poke Twitch does as much as you can. Avoid trading with him if you can- just poke him down. Once he has completed Lich Bane, he will win most auto trades, so avoid letting him trade back with you if possible.\n\nAfter recalling, Twitch can enter the lane in stealth with his s. Avoid pushing up too far when you know Twitch has just backed as he may pop up and go for a favourable trade.\n\nAP Twitch doesn\u2019t deal a lot of damage in the very early game, but once he has completed his first item, he will win most trades. Avoid over extending at all costs if he is ahead."}

Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nPost 6, avoid fighting them at all costs as they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will easily kill you.\n\nHe will be ganking a lot early on. Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As pantheon, His first games are really strong because he has a lot of CC and the reduction of damage in his kit. He can quickly instigate trick dives on weak enemies. Level six is a massive peak due to his ability to get his ultimate R. This will allow him to play around the card and get his team before. The first component will allow him to inflict more damage and spam his abilities due to the increased mana."}
{"text": "As graves, Its e is very versatile. It can use it to reposition and close the gap between it and the enemy lantern. At level 6, its Ultimate t is very strong and can allow it to execute enemies who are in poor health. If it is confronted with a weak lantern, do not be afraid to go to kill it. The e quasi-visage can cause chaos for an enemy team, especially if they are piled together. This ability can prevent the ADC enemy from choosing a target on which to concentrate while Graves continues to spell them with his self-attacks."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, Avoid team fighting around major objectives if Seraphine is nearby. Grouping closely together is going to benefit her and allow her to get a good Ultimate R off and CC your whole team.\n\nSimilarly, avoid fighting in the jungle as your team will be grouped together which can allow her to get another good Ultimate R off. Try to fight in the open and split slightly apart so she cannot CC your whole team.\n\nSeraphine will often go to ward alone during the mid-game. You can use this to your advantage to fight and pick her off. While she\u2019s dead, you can look to take the Baron, a Dragon or look for a team fight with the numbers advantage."}
{"text": "Against twitch, Don't clump up or stick close together in team fights versus Twitch as his Spray and Pray c will melt you. Spread out and look for a way to burst him down once he reveals himself.\n\nTwitch will often get incredibly close to your team after popping out of his s. Once he has left it, try to take him down as quickly as you can.\n\nControl Wards are essential in team fights. Place Trinkets and Control Wards around you when sieging an objective to spot Twitch before he is able to jump out on you."}
{"text": "As sona, Sona is excellent in team fighting because of the additional effects that her abilities provide to her allies. She just needs to position herself well. Another point in her Ultimate R will reduce capacity cooling and increase damage. This will allow her to impact team fighting more frequently. Her healing will be out of the world during this phase of the game. All she needs to do is not to die and stay with her team."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level 9 is a massive powerpike for Heimerdinger. It will now have maximized a capacity and will be paying a lot of damage depending on its maximum capacity. Moreover, as a laner medium, it will now be able to CC and blow up enemies with its capabilities. Adding another point to its Ultimate R will skyrocket its overall power in the track. That's because the powers will be more powerful, and Heimerdinger will use them both offensively and defensively. Moreover, it will allow it to relentlessly harass the enemy lantern when they try to close in the track. Heimerdinger excels during team fighting that he can control a large area with its Q turrets. This will be really useful in crowded areas like the objective pits and Jungle paths."}
{"text": "As aphelios, You're quite immobile which can make you a prime target for chain CC and assassins. You rely on extended trades, so taking you out quickly will give the enemy team a huge advantage (especially if you have your Infernum W up when you die).\n\nSome weapon combinations are really bad on you and don't synergize well. This can lead to periods where you can't retaliate as effectively as your counterpart. Avoid fighting until you get a favorable weapon combination.\n\nYou are item reliant during the mid-game. If you are camped constantly early on, you won't be able to farm freely and will have a hard time as the game goes on. Also, the enemy team will look to fight you when your Ultimate R is down, so be very careful about initiating a fight during this time."}
{"text": "As shen, Able to mitigate any form of auto-attack damage with his W. This can make the enemy physical damage carries to be practically useless when this ability is active.\n\nHe can set really good cheese brushes as well as all-in opportunities with his E. When combined with certain items, Shen can put additional debuffs on the taunted champions with ease.\n\nHis Ultimate R can allow him to act as a guardian for his teammates. This becomes really beneficial if one of Shen\u2019s teammates is fed and needs to be peeled for."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Your first game will be a little hard until you hit level 3. You should be able to gank the enemies freely once you unlock your W and E and instigate the dives turn on the weak enemies. Always look for overextended gank enemies whenever possible. Your kit will allow you CC the enemy to forget and will allow you to burst them just as quickly. Unlocking your Ultimate R will make it relatively easy for you to gank your enemies. Notify your teammates in advance that your Ultimate R can go unnoticed by them, especially in the lower elos."}
{"text": "Against lillia, Once Lillia reaches level 6, her pressure of gank and kill will increase thanks to her Ultimate R. Take note that she will be harder to kill at that time. Lillia's early match is rather weak. If you are a strong champion of the beginning of the game, try to invade and put it behind. Once Lillia completes her juggling element, its clearance speed, the release of damage and the pressure of gank will increase."}
{"text": "Against chogath, If you invade Cho-Gath, wait for him to use his abilities on the camp before launching the engagement. Cho uses these abilities to help his clear, and he is weaker when they come down. Keep the Dragon and Rift Herald monitored as much as possible because Cho-Gath can take these goals through damage to his Ultimate t. Try and take them before he can."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble deals more damage when its bar is more than 50%. Be careful to take trades when it is above this amount. Although, if you can bait its bar and overheat it will lack capacity damage. Once Rumble has its Ultimate b, its death pressure increases. Do not underestimate its all-in-potential with its Ultimate b. If it uses it on you, try to back off as its Jungler could try to gank as its Ultimate b is a good gank configuration. Rumble is strong in team fighting so wait for it to be the grouping and looking for choice with its Ultimate b during the middle and end of the game."}
{"text": "Against swain, When laning, make sure you\u2019re always stood far back but in front of your Caster Minions. This will make it impossible for him to land his Root E and CC you.\n\nExtended auto-attack trades will always work in AD champions favour. Wait for him to use his E before playing aggressive and looking for the all-in.\n\nSwain\u2019s sustain will be a problem; especially if he is with a healing Support. Invest in an early Executioner\u2019s Calling to reduce his healing in lane. "}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Kassadin is at his weakest in the early game. Try to fight as much as possible so he falls behind. Position level 6, if you have CC capabilities, don't use them unless his Ultimate k is down because he will use their cooldowns to play aggressive and trade with you. Kassadin lacks clear vague in the early game. If you can keep the wave closer to your side of the card early, it will be very difficult for him to close or break your freeze. If he walks up to the last hit, you can watch to trade with him."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Depending on her build path, Poppy\u2019s power spikes will change as her AD build and tank build have different power spikes.\n\nOnce Poppy hits level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, she will have a lot more utility and be able able to disengage from a skirmish. \n\nThe longer the game goes, the tankier Poppy will become. Try and reduce her gold income by denying her farm in the early and mid-game."}
{"text": "Against karma, Karma has her Ultimate a at level 1, so she will be quite strong up until level 6. If you are strong at level 6, you will be stronger than her once you both hit level 6.\n\nDo not isolate yourself from the minion wave at all. Stand behind minions at all time (but not too close to them as her Q deals AOE damage) so they block the damage.\n\nWhen Karma uses her d, she will be vulnerable to attack. While it\u2019s on cooldown, that\u2019s your time to play aggressive and go for a favourable trade."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make it easier to access the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}
{"text": "As singed, Pay attention to Singed's complete ability, and his intention to move around with his team. He can easily make you CC'd and killed. Try not to pursue him frequently in this matchup. Although your mobility is high, you will always take a lot of DPS from him. Once you get your ult, make sure that you CC Singed all the chances you get. Work with your team to get him down after. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy does not have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As sion, Its ultimate R can be used to install ganks on other tracks. No one suspects a Sion from the base and down or midway. Its E is a very easy skill to land that guarantees a Sion Q. This can be of great value for setting up ganks for its Jungler."}
{"text": "Against sett, Sett\u2019s laning phase is strong. Expect him to play aggressive and go for early kills. Avoid trading with him at level 1 as he will out damage most champions.\n\nOnce Sett is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his ability to get kills in lane also increases. Watch your positioning and disengage if you\u2019re low as his all-in combo deals a surprising amount of damage.\n\nIn the mid-game, Sett will be difficult to fight unless you\u2019re ahead or have assistance. Avoid fighting him and disengage if he runs at you and tries to fight you."}
{"text": "As jax, His scaling is unparalleled and he does really well in duels due to his e and e. The longer the game goes, the more dangerous he gets and can practically kill anyone no matter how healthy they are.\n\nThe e makes him take less damage from AoE abilities. This is really beneficial for him during full-blown team fights. Besides, the e CC also acts as a really good initiation tool for his team.\n\nHis Passive allows him to split push relentlessly. This can be extremely useful when Jax\u2019s team is behind and can\u2019t win a fair team fight. His e allows him to escape collapse attempts with ease."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus has crazy damage at the end of the game if he was able to get tons of piles with his Q. Is an easy champion to pick up and understand. His game plan is pretty much the same in each game too. Nasus is a very good split pusher and should seek to divide the thrust and open the card during the later parts of the game. It can be incredibly difficult to stop if he is ahead."}
{"text": "Against darius, If Darius invades you, just run away. He's one of the best duels in the game, so don't start your welcome. During the fight against Darius, try to reposition it so that his e doesn't hit you. Moving out of the ring or towards it will reduce its release from damage. Try and secure goals and spank your allies as often as possible. Darius will try to do the same,"}
{"text": "As ekko, When Ekko reaches level 3, he can start looking for aggressive parts as he would have unlocked the 3 of his basic abilities. Until then, he can fight, but he will probably not gain any significant advantage. As Ekko can do a lot of burst damage, once he has finished his Mythic article, his death pressure gets intensified. At level 6, Ekko becomes an incredible threat. He can go for risky parts and use his Ultimate R to escape. His Ultimate R can also be used aggressively, making it incredibly versatile."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lisandra has to commit to an all-in in order to make use of her kit. This can be a problem if her team is not on the same page as her. Her Ultimate R is more of a utility tool than a harmful tool. This can be a problem against the stronger midway champions. If you are behind, you will do little or no damage in team fighting and your poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "As orianna, The first item component will allow her to deal more damage and spam her abilities due to the increased mana.\n\nLevel six is a massive spike due to her getting her hands on her Ultimate d. This will let her make plays of her own or in combination with her team.\n\nShe isn't really great pre-six as she can easily be caught out and killed. Post-six is a different story, and the Ultimate d can ultimately tip the balance of a fight.        "}
{"text": "As gangplank, Try to delay team fights as long as possible while you poke the enemy down with your Barrels E.

It is a very important ability and you need to make sure it\u2019s up before committing to a fight.\n\nWhile Gangplank does have a lot of splitting power, it\u2019s better for you to group with your team in the late game as there are strengths in numbers."}
{"text": "Against varus, Varus has a good selection potential with his Ultimate R. Avoiding too extensive or being within reach of him when he was sitting in the middle track as he might be looking to start the fight. Choosing Varus before a team fight is very effective. Bursting is one of the best ways to do it because he is rather squishy and still because of the lack of a dash or ability to escape. Varus will try to delay a team fight as long as possible while harassing with his Qs and Es."}
{"text": "As gragas, Gragas' Ultimate R is very good in team fighting. It deals a lot of damage and can move the entire enemy team. It has good support in the way (compared to many other champions) with its W. This will allow it to look for jobs more frequently and heal after a job. Its E can be used in conjunction with Flash to get surprise jobs/commitments with the enemy. It can also use it to interrupt enemy abilities and dashes."}
{"text": "As lucian, Once Lucian unlocks his 3rd stage Ultimate R, he will be able to dish out tons of consistent damage, especially to low health targets. It will make it easier for him to burst down enemies.\n\nLucian will gain access to multiple items during this stage of the game. He will both be able to sustain himself, as well as deal hefty amounts of consistent damage.\n\nLucian's Q and E will be maxed out during this game stage. It will let him all-in enemies consistently and will allow him to reposition himself frequently."}

Good times to look for aggressive plays are when the enemy ADC uses their dash or the enemy Support walks up to poke you.\n\nIn team fights, your mobility is quite formidable. With your Ultimate, you\u2019re able to flank the enemy from the side, get a kill and then escape before anyone is able to catch you. "}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early will help reduce Xin Zhaos killing pressure in the way and increase your chances of surviving in bad matches. Investing in the reduction of healing will help you a ton against Xin Zhao because it tends to have a lot of hold in the way and throughout the game. Xin Zhao is strong in early play. Expect him to go for aggressive coins in attempts to get an early lead."}
{"text": "Against naafiri, She is very good at roaming and ganking, so make sure you communicate with your team so they know when she is missing. Place vision in her jungle entrances and the river.\n\nIn the mid-game, she will look to take down targets that are walking around the map alone. Avoid moving through the river if it\u2019s not warded.\n\nPlaying around her Packmates in the mid-game and during team fights will be extremely beneficial as she will lack damage.\n"}
{"text": "Against veigar, Veigar is at his weakest in early play. Try to abuse him to put him back. Delaying his batteries will make him less effective in the later stages of the game. When Veigar uses his n, try to abuse cool down as he is his only defensive tool in early play and once he is quite vulnerable. In order to get ganks or kill the Veigar, you need to bait his n first. You can do it by constantly tipping into and out of range of him. Make sure you always bait him before you commit to the whole."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Make sure you\u2019re only using your abilities when you have to, especially your E. Aatrox suffers from long cooldowns and is easily abusable when they\u2019re on cooldown.\n\nYou\u2019ll fall off in the later stages of the game. Try and end the game as quickly as you can or snowball your lead so you\u2019ll be a huge threat in team fights.\n\nAatrox is not an easy champion to learn.

{"text": "As vayne, Its first ability will be maximized at level 9. From that moment on, it will begin to hit like a truck that its e will be at the top very quickly in the game. This and its n will make it impossible for a single enemy top laner to catch it. Obtaining two points in its Ultimate n will pick it up again. This will help her a lot in team fighting, especially when the enemy team is filled with heavy CC champions. She will have her basics by then, which means that she will make a respectable amount of damage."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Save your active Q to send the scurry enemy away from you if they're all in you. Make sure you set the vision around the track whenever possible. You can be a premium gank target before hitting level 6, because you're still enough. Once you get your Ultimate R, your team battle impact should increase massively. Use effigies and bamboozle enemies with surprise Ultimate R's on them."}
{"text": "As lux, Lux will not have a lot of articles and will do a lot of harm due to its AP ratios. Any squishy who gets caught by his g will certainly end up dying. She will climb really hard to level 11. It is mainly because of her upgrade Ultimate n, which will increase the damage of this ability while drastically reducing its cooling. The mid-lane brushes will be a good place to wait for unsuspecting enemies. Lux is usually good during team fighting, but she will excel in fighting in the bottlenecks. The enemy will not be able to do anything to avoid the g of Lux and will be zoned by her poke l."}

{"text": "As karthus, Karthus' ultimate e is an excellent tool, and it can allow him to impact the map from afar. His afterlife alone can change the tide of a fight, especially if the enemy continues to fight near him after his death. Karthus' early play is relatively weak. This can make it difficult for him to survive the laning phase, especially when faced with a strong early champion."}
{"text": "As tristana, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Pantheon is a champion from beginning to half-time and is therefore very strong from levels 1 to 6 and can influence other tracks also when he gets his R. If Pantheon gets 1 or 2 killed, he can finish Ghostblade from Youmuu and his other base elements faster. Be careful what he has of assets and try to play around them. Be careful after the laning phase, as Pantheon will try to kill you with Grand Starfall R and force a 5 vs 4."}
{"text": "As swain, Try and stick with your Support throughout the mid-game. You\u2019re quite vulnerable and easy to kill if you\u2019re on your own. By staying with your Support, your survivability will increase.\n\nContinue picking up farm in the side lanes when no team fights are occurring, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to dish out damage in fights.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac is quite decent in late-game team fights, especially if he manages to get a flank on the enemy. Another reason why he is so good is that he can easily bypass vision and catch the enemy off-guard.\n\nOnce he gets to level 16, he will have three points in his Ultimate R. This means that he will be able to use it frequently and deal a lot of damage to the enemy team at a go. He should be able to catch enemies off-guard easily.\n\nOnce he reaches the stage where he has two different abilities maxed out, he will have a straightforward time securing picks while working with his Jungler. He can even assist his Jungler in setting up death brushes for the enemy."}
{"text": "As twitch, Roam around with your s as much as you can as it can allow you to get kills with utmost ease. You will also want to ensure that you keep clearing Control Wards on the map.\n\nDuring neutral objective fights, you should close off Jungle paths from where the enemy is about to come. Your k should let you do that easily but drop it in one of the river entrance brushes.\n\nProtecting your ADC should be important but don't go around throwing your life for it. If your ADC has become a liability, feel free to take matters into your own hands."}
{"text": "Against veigar, The longer the game goes, the stronger Veigar will be thanks to the unlimited stacking with his e. End the game as quickly as you can.\n\nVeigar is rather weak and vulnerable in the early game. You could try to abuse this to set him behind and miss out on stacks.\n\nOnce Veigar has his Ultimate R, his kill pressure increases. Keep in mind that he will deal a lot of extra damage at this time. "}
{"text": "As lucian, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will give him a huge boost and will allow him to take over the middle of the game easily. Lucian is excellent during the middle of the game because it is the moment when he is most powerful. He can now go on a side track and thrust divided due to his passive and basic abilities. That's also why his abilities will hit like a truck, and he will frequently kill enemies. At level 11, Lucian will be able to get his stage 2 Ultimate R. He can help him massively during neutral, objective and duel battles due to the amount of damage he puts on the dishes."}
{"text": "As viktor, At that time, it will have its first significant enhanced capability. This allows it to gain a lot of team combat pressure, and now it can take regular fights. Another point in its Ultimate m will allow it to flatten a lot of coherent DPS and use the ability quite frequently. At level 9, its will be maximized outside. This will allow it to release waves in a jiffy and inflict tons of damage to the targets affected by it."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Her early game damage is quite potent, especially if she manages to land her C on the enemy. Use the lane brushes to catch enemies off-guard.\n\nLevel six is a small spike as it allows her to roam but doesn't provide her with anything else. This means that it will only let her make plays, but she still needs to land her basic abilities to do damage.\n \nThe first component will allow her to spam abilities and dish out a lot of damage to her enemies. It will be incredibly beneficial during the laning phase.        "}
{"text": "As orianna, Try the seat goals with your team during the middle of the game. You have powerful pose tools that will allow you to sit the goals with ease. Try to bring down the enemy as much as possible while your team tries to take turns (or the Dragon or Baron). Delay team fights as long as possible while you harass the enemy and crush them with your d and d. Try to pass mid-lane with your ADC and see if you can get mid-priority. It will allow you to get tricks and goals with your team easily."}
{"text": "As lillia, Level 11 will be a decent power peak for Lillia because it will have an improved Ultimate R. The cooldown will be reduced, which will allow Lillia to play games frequently in the game. Its Q will be maximized to level 9. This is really good for her because its burst damage will increase exponentially, and it will be a threat to face. Lillia excels during the middle of the game due to her ability to secure choices."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Flank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nAfter your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "As volibear, Extremely strong duelist, especially during the early game. He can force any enemy champion to at least use their Flash if he manages to catch them out of position.\n\nVolibear\u2019s Ultimate R can allow him to set tower dives very easily. This can be used to kill low health solo laners in the top lane, or kill the enemy bot lane while Jungling.\n\nHis pick potential during the mid-game can allow him to take objectives quite freely during the game. This can be converted to an easy win if he can work with his team."}
{"text": "As braum, Braum is strong every time his Ultimate R is in place. He has a good selection potential and can help you get the murders. Every use of his Ultimate R can lead to a murder. Braum is really good against the men's champions, murderers and hard commitment champions that he can the CCs as soon as they engage with his Q and Passive. He's really good in the team fights thanks to his E and r. This makes him a very good support because he can offer his wearing tons of peel and protection."}
{"text": "Against amumu, The Amumu team's presence is very strong. Do not regroup too closely as it will allow it to get a multi-person entanglement with its Ultimate y. Do not fight in the jungle either for the same reason. Try to start a team fight as soon as it has ended. Fighting when Amumu is not there or when his Ultimate is on cooldown is a sure way to win the next fight."}
{"text": "As lux, Work with your Jungler and set up traps inside the enemy Jungle once you've finished pushing the wave in. Your g will allow you to get free killing effortlessly. Fighting around the choking points will be really good for you, so look for opportunities to do it. This is particularly applicable during neutral fighting, goals in the game. Getting your basic elements will make you really powerful. Use the brushes to set up death traps for the squishes in your way."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Once Lee Sin reaches level 6, his death pressure increases and it will be much more frightening to play against. Expect him to go for aggressive games. When Lee Sin finished his first component, his damage output will increase considerably. Look at your positioning so it can't easily get you down."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Very versatile when it comes to builds and team comps. She can be both a tank destroyer, as well as a decimator of squishier champions depending on which build she opts for.\n\nShe is very strong when fighting in a 1 v 1 with no minions around. This is because her Q can all target the same champion and do a lot of damage in a short time.\n\nHer E and Ultimate R allows her to be independent in the lane, while her Support roams around to get some kills or assists. Her Ultimate R can be used as a way to catch up and finish opponents as well, especially after they Flash or dash away from her."}
{"text": "As viego, Just focus on agriculture during this phase of the game. You want to hit your mid-game powerpike very quickly, and farming your camps is an effective way to do it. Try gank the tracks you are close to, especially if the enemy is pushed up. The same rule applies for counter ganks, but make sure that your W and E are in place before you can glove. If you happen to be on the other side of the map when the enemy jungler gets your sleds, just try to make sure that you invade the enemy jungle and fly as many camps as you can. That way, you won't fall behind."}
{"text": "Against ekko, When Ekko hits level 9, his waveclear drastically increases. At this point in time, he will look to go collect CS from side lanes and split push. Send someone to match him in the side lane to prevent him from farming for free and taking turrets.\n\nOnce Ekko hits level 6, his kill pressure increases and he will look to go for kills. Respect his all in potential when his Ultimate R is up as he will use it to escape after a kill.\n\nEkkos biggest power spike is at two items (Protobelt and Lichbane). When he completes these items, he will become a one-shotting machine. Ensure there is vision around the map and do not walk in un-warded areas when you\u2019re unsure where Ekko is."}
{"text": "Against rammus, From level 2 onwards, Rammus can gank with his t. If you know where he started, he may try to level 2 gank mid or try to level 3 gank the opposite side of the map.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the tankier Rammus becomes. Make sure you get magic penetration items for AP champs and armour pen for AD champs.\n\nOnce Rammus hits level 6, he becomes more of a nuisance as he will now deal more damage when he ganks. Play respectfully and avoid overextending post 6 to reduce his chances of visiting your lane."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone with your n who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas manages to get to level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate R. This means that he can initiate fights and displace key enemy targets way more frequently.\n\nAt level 9, Gragas will have his first ability maxed out. This is really beneficial for him as the damage increase will really help him duel. This is especially true if Gragas is going for the full AP build.\n\nDuring the mid-game, the enemy will be busy swapping lanes and setting vision. Therefore, as a Support, Gragas should work with the Jungler to invade the enemy Jungle and kill such targets."}
{"text": "As senna, Level 6 is a good powerspike because Senna will get its Ultimate R and can help allies on the whole card. It can also get the finish kills with capacity. The first element increases its damage and allows it to use its capabilities a little more frequently. It is still mana-hungry, so it will have to pay attention to spamming spells."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Gwen will be very strong when she has her passive stack. Think twice before committing to an all-in or 1v1 against her when you see her stacked completely. When Gwen reaches level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, her duelling power will intensify. Watch out for the fights at this point."}
{"text": "As syndra, Let her push early. Keep the wave near your turret but don\u2019t let her push you under your tower.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve got your first item, you can start pushing Syndra into her turrets and matching her wave pushing power.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave. Syndra uses her Q and W on the minion wave, and by standing outside of the wave she cannot push and poke you at the same time.\n\nHer level 6 is much stronger than yours. Recall if you\u2019re low or else she will one-shot you."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Sylas\u2019 level 6 power spike is really strong depending on the matchup he is in. If your Ultimate is powerful, then his Ultimate R will be powerful too.\n\nThe longer the game goes the stronger Sylas will become. Avoid feeding him in the early game to reduce his strength in the mid and late game.\n\nAfter Sylas has completed his first item, he will have more lane pressure and will look to play offensive. Up until that point, try to abuse him as much as possible."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille doesn\u2019t have the healthiest or fastest clear. You can use this to your advantage by invading her in the early game and stealing away some of her camps.\n \nEarly wards will reduce the effectiveness of Camille\u2019s ganks. In particular, a jungle or river ward at level 1 can stop her from getting a successful level 2 gank off. \n \nWhenever Camille\u2019s Ultimate R is up, she will be looking to gank a lane. You will need to equal her pressure by ganking, counter ganking or by securing objectives on the opposite side of the map."}
{"text": "As amumu, Continue to look for ganking opportunities whenever your Ultimate yis up. Play around the cooldown and look for as many ganks as possible.\n\nAfter successfully winning a team fight, look to take the Baron with your allies. Do not make the call for Baron if you\u2019re low, if the enemy Jungler is nearby or if there's any chance that you\u2019ll be unable to take it quickly.\n\nKeep farming every jungle camp you can so you\u2019re able to stay up in gold and XP to get your required items."}
{"text": "As lulu, Use your k to poke Lulu out of the lane. That combined with your e will result in massive damage outputs from your end.\n\nOnly use your s when Lulu's W is down. Failing to do so will get you killed easily as her W is really annoying.\n\nIf Lulu is playing safely, just focus on roaming with your s. The enemies won't expect it and will fall prey to your damage.\n\nThe wave is to be kept in the middle of the lane and you should just focus on dishing out damage."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Look out for an aggressive level 1 play. They can easily try and take you down if you overstep.\n\nTry your hardest to poke and harass the enemy, but don\u2019t over commit to it as they can turn around an exchange easily.\n\nThe enemies level 6 isn\u2019t very strong in 2v2 fights as their Ultimate R is a utility tool.. With this in mind, use your level 6 advantage to play aggressive and take them down."}
{"text": "As kayn, Depending on your form, you should either be the frontline for your team using the red form, or you should be waltzing in and out the enemy backline and killing them off.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a very short cooldown now. This means that you can regularly all-in the enemy team and get free kills. Just make sure that you don't target someone who has a dash ability up.\n\nGetting a defensive item should help you immensely, especially if the enemy team is mobile in nature. It will help you a lot during neutral, objective fights when you need to target a specific champion around choke points."}
{"text": "As brand, At level 11, Brand will put a second point in its Ultimate R. Whatever its advance or delay, its release of damage will be substantial in the team fights. At level 9, Brand would have maximized its ability W. This helps him in many ways, including helping him keep the enemy pushed in their turn and as a stalking tool to harass the enemy lantern. In the middle of the game, Brand would have finished several articles. He will also have a lot of additional ability to hasten or cool the reduction, allowing him to use his capabilities more frequently to harass."}
{"text": "As renekton, Once Renekton gets two points in his Ultimate t, he will be able to run down enemies with ease. The best effect will be seen during fights around chokepoints, though, as the enemies won't be able to run away easily.\n\nRenekton will have multiple items now. This means that he will be dealing a lot of damage to his enemies while simultaneously tanking a lot of damage. Any enemy who gets caught out by him will get chunked out and probably die.\n\nRenekton is decent in the mid-game, but he should focus on ending the game during this phase of the game itself. Taking as many team fights as possible and getting rid of the enemy backline is his win condition."}
{"text": "As vayne, Mechanically challenging to play as one mistake/misstep can get her killed immediately. Crowd control is her mortal enemy and her enemies can get rid of her as soon as she is crowd controlled.\n\nQuite vulnerable in team fights without her Ultimate n. She needs the invisibility in order to juke her enemies, otherwise, she can\u2019t really do much other than completely rely on her team.\n\nShe is very weak during the early game and hence can easily be shut down with constant ganks from the enemy team. Her short-range doesn\u2019t help her either so the enemy can camp this lane with ease."}
{"text": "As sett, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As amumu, At level 11, Aumu will have 2 points in his Ultimate y. This means that his Ultimate will be there on a shorter cooldown that can help him in team fighting and help his team get choices. The teams start to regroup during the middle of the game, and since Aumu is a team combat champion, he is pretty good during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As quinn, Her level 6 power spike is not as strong as many other ADC\u2019s. Keep this in mind during the laning phase.\n\nShe is strong during the early laning phase thanks to her Passive and all-in strength.\n\nWhen Quinn completes her first component item, her trading power in the lane and her ability to go for trades increases dramatically.\n"}
{"text": "As aatrox, Aatrox tends to fall off later in the game as the enemy will buy items that counter him. They will also be grouping which makes it harder for Aatrox to secure kills.\n\nIf he can get on to them, you will still be able to take down carries in late game team fights. Suppose you\u2019re able to land a W on high priority target- go in and try to take them down.\n\nYou must play around with your Ultimate R in the late game. Fighting while it\u2019s on cooldown could be the difference between winning a fight and losing it. When you have 3 points in your Ultimate, your sustain is very difficult to deal with."}
{"text": "As rumble, In the late game, Rumble would have lots of damage and magic pen. His abilities are really going to hurt the enemy.\n\nAt level 16, he will put the final point in his Ultimate. His Ultimate will be deadly in a team fight if used correctly.\n\nRumble is a great team-fighting champion, and due to his low cooldown Ultimate, he can look for picks and force fights on enemies who are over-extended or caught out of positon. \n"}
{"text": "As olaf, Olaf\u2019s Ultimate k allows him to dodge CC as it prevents him from being locked down by hard crowd control.\n\nOlaf\u2019s 1v1 potential is extremely strong. This makes him a formidable opponent in the 1v1 and makes him hard to play against. Look to play aggressive and fight the enemy whenever possible.\n\nThanks to his t slow, he can easily chase down any laner or any champion he comes into contact with."}
{"text": "As yone, After your bot track has turned towards the medium track, move to the side track and start cultivating and winning XP there. You can look at 1v1 any enemy who tries to stop you. Look for frequent trades with the enemy throughout the laning phase. Getting an early killing could snowball the way strongly in your favor. Once you are level 6, look for more aggressive play. Your Ultimate R is an excellent scarring tool and you can get killed with it."}
{"text": "As braum, At level 11, Braum will put a second point in his Ultimate r. The extra damage and reduced cooldown are very beneficial for him during this stage of the game.\n\nAt level 9, Braum will max out his first ability. If he is maxing his Q first, he will be able to look for picks more frequently thanks to the lower cooldown.\n\nTeams will start to group during the mid-game. This is good for Braum as his Ultimate r is an AOE tool that can knockup multiple champions."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Never accuse your pout in the open air. Do not follow this instruction will kill you. Counter-turn at your risk in this matchup. Never walk in front of you in the fog of war first just because you saw Nautilus wander. Keep the wave in the middle of the track and see if you can keep the track brushes kept at any time for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "As singed, Level 11 is a decent power peak because it will have another point in its Ultimate n. Its overall damage will be increased, with its resistances. At level 9, its l will be maximized. This means that it can make a lot of consistent DPS during the team fights if it succeeds in not getting CC'd. Its tankness will be really high, mainly if it uses its Ultimate n. This will allow it to do its main job to run circles around the enemy team with its l."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Beware of your positioning in the late part. Focus on the kitting and automatic attack of the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so that you are not taken out and focused by the enemy. You must stay with your team in the late part. Do not move around the map or go anywhere unless someone is with you. Be a part of neutral objective fights as much as you can Stand back from your team near your main door. Avoid walking too far from anyone in the late part. Being caught will lead the enemy to push their advantage and finish the game."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana\u2019s early game strength depends on the matchup she is in. She can either be quite strong or really weak.\n\nAt level 6, Shyvanaa will unlock her Dragon t form. She truly comes online at this stage of the game as she basically gets access to a free escape tool and 3 additional abilities.\n\nWhen Shyvana has completed her Mythic item, her trading potential in lane increases and she can start to look for frequent trades with the enemy laner.\n"}
{"text": "As bard, Once you reach this stage, you should focus more on roaming and impacting the map with your Ultimate R and E. When deep warding, make sure you keep your E ready to escape out of any sticky situations.\n\nBefore leaving your lane, drop some W shrines here and there. This will help your ADC stay healthy, especially when they are up against a poke lane.\n\nAlways try to bait the enemy laners into pushing and use the wall behind them to E and then stun them with your Q. Pairing up with your Jungler/other laners will yield maximum effectiveness and the enemies generally don't anticipate such plays."}
{"text": "Against kennen, Kennen\u2019s power spikes depend heavily on the items he buys. \n\nAt level 6, Kennen will get access to his Ultimate m which is a great tool for him as it increases his kill pressure and his ability to trade with you. As soon as he activates his Ultimate m, run away. \n\nKennen is really good in team fights thanks to the AOE damage on his Ultimate m. Try and avoid fighting in tight spaces as Kennen will be able to deal damage to your whole team at once. Group but do not group close together. "}
{"text": "As viego, Viego can steal the lives of his enemies which can allow him to escape danger. As he becomes untargetable, it can allow him to dodge incoming damage.\n\nViego is a fun and rewarding champion to play thanks to his Passive and his Ultimate R. Expect yourself to get hooked on him quite quickly.\n\nViego has a high skill ceiling. This means the more effort you put into him, the better you will be at him. Keep playing him and see yourself skyrocket in the ranks"}
{"text": "As ekko, Ekko can start ganking after level 3 when he gains access to all 3 of his basic abilities. However, he shouldn\u2019t over force ganks too much as he needs early gold and XP so he can get his first item.\n\nAs Ekko can deal a lot of burst damage, once he has completed his Mythic item, his kill pressure intensifies.\n\nAt level 6, Ekko becomes an incredible threat. He can go for risky plays and use his Ultimate R to escape. Even though he can tower dive before 6 with his W, he can dive deeper with his R."}
{"text": "As zac, You will be really tanky during this phase of the game so make sure that you initiate fights for your team. Let your team know before you all in, though, and keep track of your Passive.\n\nChokepoint fights will be your bread and butter. Your ability to keep the enemies zoned out is next to none, and hence you should not let them come close to the objective pits.\n\nAlways try to separate the enemy backline from the enemy frontline. This will let your allies play more freely and will keep them safe from the damage dealt by the enemy backline."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine's early game is pretty decent. Her damage and CC are pretty substantial, especially if she can use the lane brushes.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent powerspike as Seraphine will get her Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is stacked together or is standing in a line.\n\nThe first item component increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a bit more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will need to be careful about spamming spells.        "}
{"text": "Against ryze, The Ryze laning phase is when it is at its weakest. Avoid trading with it too much in the game very early that he will just want to remember early and get his Tear anyway. When Ryze reaches level 6, his death pressure does not increase because his Ultimate R is not a harmful tool. For most champions, your level 6 will be stronger than his. Try to fight as often as possible. Ryze needs time on scale, so delaying his ability to scale is the key."}
{"text": "Against ekko, When Ekko reaches level 9, his wave signal increases considerably. At that time, he will seek to collect CS sideways and split thrust. Send someone to match him in the sidetrack to prevent him from growing for free and taking turrets. Once Ekko touches level 6, his pressure of death increases and he will seek to go to kill. Respect his everything in potential when his ultimate R is standing as he will use it to escape after a murder. Ekkos greater peak of power is two articles (Protobelt and Lichbane). When he completes these articles, he will become a machine to shoot a blow."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Cho=Gath is a monster as the game continues. It can easily eat an unexpected target that wanders through the Rift of Summoners alone. If you don't know where Cho=Gath is, don't walk through the isolated river or without vision. Cho=Gath=The abilities are crucial when it comes to winning the team fight. Do not group too close together so he is unable to land his e on your entire team. When he sips a goal like Baron or Dragon, don't start if Cho=Gath is alive. With his Ultimate t, he deals more damage than Smite, so it's better not to take the 50/50."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to 1 v 1 target quite frequently. He should be able to secure picks even now.\n\nHe is pretty decent during late-game fights, as his AoE abilities will hurt a lot. His survivability is quite appreciable as well.\n\nHis tankiness will be massive during this phase of the game. He should be focused on absorbing a lot of damage for the enemy team while simultaneously picking off enemies when possible."}
{"text": "As senna, Consider investing in healing reduction items or abilities to counter Senna's sustain. This can help reduce their ability to heal and trade effectively during skirmishes and all-ins.\n\nMaintain the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This encourages Senna and their ADC to overextend, creating opportunities for your jungler to gank and potentially secure kills or summoner spells.\n\nTake advantage of windows of opportunity to detach from your ADC and harass Senna when they've used one of their abilities. This puts them at a disadvantage in trades, as they have one less ability to trade back effectively.\n\nBe cautious at level 6, as Senna's kill pressure increases with her ultimate ability. Expect them to look for aggressive plays and be prepared to play defensively, utilizing Yuumi's healing and utility to keep your ADC safe."}
{"text": "As jhin, Its immobility is its main weakness because it has a large target painted on its head because of this. If the enemy manages to catch it, it will die. Due to its passive, it is not really good against tanks, especially those who can put themselves on its face. It will take ages for it to get rid of a real tank. The Ultimate R root it in place. This allows the enemy both flank and concentrate it with ease."}
{"text": "As katarina, Play safe in early play. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you will fight for the way and you will delay your first major power peak. Katarina is a strong roaming champion. If your allies are strong, watch to wander frequently to get extra kills and snowball your lead."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Extremely vulnerable when her E is down as she can be an easy target to CC at that time. If she uses this ability with caution, she will die many times in the track, as well as during team fighting. Incorrect positioning or aggressive use of her Ultimate R can get her killed several times. This can allow the enemy team to bait her and get rid of her pretty quickly. If she's down during the early game, she's won, she can't be online as fast as her counterparts."}
{"text": "As yorick, Yorick isn't powerful early on, and he should focus on farming to scale up. He can do that easily by using the lane brushes to drop vision while simultaneously using his ghouls to keep enemies off him.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant power spike as he can now split push really well. It will also help him win duels as the Maiden does do a lot of damage to enemies.\n\nHis first item component will allow him to gain more significant damage and sustainability in the lane. He can quickly push his wave in and then recall and be back even before the enemy wave hits his own tower.        "}
{"text": "Against gnar, As soon as Gnar reaches level 6, try to avoid standing near the walls when he's in Mega Form as he can throw you against them with his Ultimate R and set up his Jungler. Gnar is really good in the extended trades if he can use his reach advantage that his W can proc in a skirmish. Try to exchange around his Q so that he can't easily proc his W. Gnar is much stronger once he has his first article, which is usually Black Cleaver. This article will make him much better in a 1v1, and you'll have to be a little more careful if you're a reservoir that Black Cleaver offers armor and more mobility."}
{"text": "As ahri, During fights, always try to get to the enemy backline by flanking them from out of vision. A Sweeper may help you with that. If you can't do so, just keep chipping on the enemy frontline, till you can catch someone out with your E.\n\nStick with your ADC throughout the mid parts of the game. You find it hard to one-shot an enemy unless they\u2019re squishy and you\u2019re ahead.\n\nSet up ambushes with your team around the Dragon or Baron. Ahri can start fights and pick off players with her E. Just make sure the bush isn\u2019t warded."}

Look for the sides of the enemy team whenever possible, but not enter with your W. It is strictly an escape spell if you try to flank the enemy. Chokepoint fights will be better for you because your E and Ultimate R can certainly disrupt the enemy team. Play around the vision to catch the out-of-guard enemy."}
{"text": "As sejuani, Her tankess is exceptionally high in the middle of the game. Her main job will be to make sure that she can get peaks on squishy door and kill them quickly. Another point in her Ultimate R will decrease the cooling of capacity. It will allow her to CC enemies quite frequently. It is decent enough for the peaks around the card. Sejuani is pretty decent during team fighting as she can absorb a lot of damage and has CC for days. She can peel for her doors quite efficiently as well."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Once he adds two points in his Ultimate r, his kill pressure will increase significantly due to the amount of damage dealt by that ability.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level nine. This offers a lot of kill pressure for Tahm Kench, and he can try to look for more frequent all-in and roams on overextended enemies.\n\nTahm will have completed multiple items during this stage of the game. This means that he will die a lot less while increasing the amount of consistent damage he deals to enemies during all-ins.        "}

It will allow him to use the ability more often, making it easier for him to convert fights into a 1 v 1 as and when required.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out by the time he hits level 9. This is a crucial power spike as it massively increases his damage output and dueling capacity.\n\nXin is excellent in team fights and picking of enemies due to his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to single out enemies, allowing him to be immune from ranged carries.        "}
{"text": "As syndra, Very still and can collapse easily with multi-layer CC. Once CC-d, she will probably die with appropriate follow-up. Without her E, she is quite vulnerable and a sensitive gank target. This is especially true when the enemy has a varied form of CC. Positioning is absolutely necessary for this champion otherwise she can easily be caught and killed due to the motionless way and bursting that is related to her."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar has great pick potential with his Ultimate R. Picking off one champion could win you the game!\n\nMalzahar has a shield that will protect him against incoming damage.

{"text": "As warwick, You will want to look for regular exchanges with Warwick. Your W and E should allow you to win fights easily. Once you get your ultimate R, you should be able to all enemies regularly. You can even be able to gank other ways than and when possible. Getting your basic items should allow you to fight much easier and support yourself in the way. Your Q will really be beneficial for you to ensure survival during the biggest fight."}
{"text": "As chogath, The longer the game is, the more stacked it will be. This makes it strong enough in the last game. When it reaches level 16, Cho=Gath will put the third and final point in its Ultimate t. It will be able to bite easily and execute enemies that are taken out of position by its team. According to its construction path, Cho=Gath will either do a lot of damage in late game fights or be incredibly tanky."}
{"text": "Against karthus, If you see Karthus using his Ultimate e at the beginning of the fight, try the CC to cancel his Ultimate e. If you kill Karthus at the beginning of the fight, try to reposition and move away from his Passive. This will reduce his damage exit and make the survival of the team fight easier. If you spot Karthus in a side track pushed by division, you can start a team fight. But, you must keep in mind that he can influence the existing fight with his Ultimate e."}
{"text": "As pyke, Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to use it frequently and increase the damage. It will be a huge ability during the middle of the game. Mid-game is really good for Pyke because he can secure several peaks on the enemy team, especially on the enemy Support if he manages to catch them out of sight. His team fight is pretty good because his Ultimate R can finally allow him to turn the tide of a fight. The Q can allow him to separate targets from their team and kill them."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass."}
{"text": "As veigar, Your complete build will allow you to kill squishy targets with one e and Ultimate R. Moreso, your Ultimate R will be up frequently, hence use it liberally.\n\nTry to CC multiple targets at a time during this phase of the game. Your AoE damage potential is really high and can completely wipe out a team if you time it well.\n\nDo not wander about alone in unwarded areas of the map. You are already immobile, and anyone with a dash or spell shield can kill you. Stick with your team and work with them to one-shot enemies."}
{"text": "As gragas, Use your ability rotation on protection and coat for your carts. If they die, the probability of winning you the team fight will be lower. Often the enemy will be misplaced in the late part. Use this to your advantage by hitting in the enemy door with your Ultimate R. Catching them out of position will make the winning late game team fights much easier. Look for choices in the late part and around the goals. Then, use the number advantage to start another fight or secure a goal."}
{"text": "As viego, Focus on early farming. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.

{"text": "As syndra, Take care of its poke and range advantage during laning. Defend the minion wave to force it to choose between pushing and throwing simultaneously.

{"text": "As rengar, If Rengar falls behind in the early game, it will be really hard for him to get back into the game.\n\nHis W is his major defensive tool.

{"text": "As udyr, You are really good at securing the goals in early play. Look to secure the goals whenever they are. Find a healthy balance between the glove of your allies, the agriculture of your jungle and safety goals. Make sure you don't fall behind in XP trying to gank constantly. Look several times at the gank tracks that are wider or Flashless. Your champion is very good at several times the glove tracks over and over again."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Go for short burst trades with your Q in this matchup. Use it to heal yourself when possible.\n\nYour Ultimate R should help you massively, especially when you use the lane brushes. That being said, bait his W out before going in on him.\n\nRoam around and see if you can get kills elsewhere on the map, specifically on pushed enemies.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and scale up. This will also expose Gangplank to ganks."}
{"text": "As seraphine, A maxed-out Ultimate R will help Seraphine out a lot during team fights. She can dish out a lot of damage, and the CC will allow her team to collapse on the enemy quickly.\n\nShe should be really great as the game goes on because she will be getting all her items by now. She will need to take care of her fighting positioning to ensure that she isn't picked off.\n\nAll her significant items will be completed now, and she will be able to dish out a lot of damage in very short burst trades. She will also provide a lot of peeling and healing for her teammates."}
{"text": "As teemo, Its passive can be really heinous to manage, especially when it hides in a brush and moves in and out while peeling its laner with its ts and ts. It is the jerk of the ADC sector as its t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the efficiency of the portage for a while, which gives its team some time to engage/disengage freely. The Ultimate t can act as a substitution to the vision, as well as do a lot of damage when it is kept in the right places."}

Also, please make sure that you use it on the proper terrain else you may end up landing right into the enemy team's lap.\n\nGetting your core items should help you a lot and will make your Q hit like a truck. Make sure you use it regularly along with your charged attacks.\n\nAlthough you are mobile, make sure that you don't chase an enemy into their Jungle.

{"text": "As akshan, Akshan has tons of mobility thanks to his E. It can allow him to move around the lane with ease, and get on to the enemy laner quickly.\n\nAkshan can bring back his dead allies if he can kill the enemy who killed them.

{"text": "As aatrox, The first significant peak of Aatrox is at level 3 when it has access to all its basic abilities. This will allow it to go for favorable trades. Once Aatrox has obtained its first component element, it will be able to go for favorable trades. Look to play more aggressive once you get your first component element. When Aatrox has obtained its ultimate R; its death pressure increases considerably. Additional damage and healing that it gets from this ability can help it start a snowball."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin should finish the game with this point, as he will now begin to fall. He will always be able to choose enemies, however. Once Lee Sin gets 3 points in his Ultimate k, he will disrupt enemy fighting frequently and act as an asset for his team. Lee Sin will have several elements during this phase of the game. It will allow him to survive longer during his fights and allow him to play the role of the disruptor very effectively."}
{"text": "As maokai, Divide the thrust during the middle of the game and try to secure the secondary goals. Avoid regrouping when your Ultimate R is down. Group with your team when your Ultimate R is up. Rotate from the side lane to where your team is and look for a choice with your Ultimate R. Peel for your allies in team fighting. As you are a tank, you are rather weak unless your aircraft carriers are alive. So keeping them alive is the key in team fighting. Be ready to peel for them when needed."}
{"text": "As riven, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5.

{"text": "As brand, Brands Ultimate R is very good in team fights as it can bounce between enemies. If the enemy is grouped in the jungle, his damage output will be very high.\n\nBrand has good ganks in the early game. As long as he gets close to the enemy before using his Q, ganks should always work in his favour.\n\nHe has a healthy clear in the current meta. As long as you kite camps, you should remain relatively healthy on your first few clears."}

Working with the allied Jungler will help him massively.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities quite frequently. It will also let him deal more damage, especially once he gets his Ultimate R.        "}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Trendamere is not so good if it is behind and weak in gold. It needs a lot of gold and XP to carry solo in the later parts of the game. Whenever its Ultimate e is in decline, it is quite vulnerable which makes it (somewhat a little) weaker. Can be kited quite easily and is prone to disengage/CC in team fighting. This can make the team fight difficult for a Trendamere."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce will try to use his range advantage to harass you and bring you down. Try to stay away when you're not looking to hit the minions last or he can attack you for free. Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in early play. Jayce can zone you away from the minions easily if you've pushed in his turn. If Jayce lands his s and jumps on you, use your e directly under you. This way, if he changes shape and jumps on you, it will be hit. Your level 6 is much stronger than Jayces. Use this knowledge to your advantage to start playing more aggressive."}
{"text": "Against soraka, Once Soraka reaches level 6, its card pressure increases and it can impact the card with its Ultimate R. Once it is level 6, make sure that you ping your team so they know that it has its Ultimate R available. After Soraka has finished its first element, its release of damage and maintenance will increase. Expect it to play a little more aggressive when it has finished this element."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Try to team fight in the open so he is unable to use his empowered E to stun your whole team. Do not fight inside the jungle as the size of his E is roughly the same as the jungle.\n \nOnce Heimerdinger hits level 6, he technically unlocks 3 new abilities. Be careful when trying to initiate a skirmish with him as he might just pull out his magic card and kill you.\n \nJust like during the laning phase, you\u2019ll want to destroy Heimerdingers Turrets Q as quickly as you can before a team fight is underway so he is unable to dish out tons of damage."}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Try not to group too closely as this will allow Vladimir to get a good Ultimate e Off. By separating slightly, Vladimir will have to use his Ultimate e on fewer targets. Expect Vladimir to flank on the side in the team fights. Watch your flanks so that you find him before he is able to climb to the top of your team. If you don't already have, you need the reduction of healing on your portages to reduce his healing and support in the team fight."}
{"text": "As malphite, Don't fight at the end of the game unless your **Ultimate** is in place. It's crucial that you only start or look for fights when it's available because you're going to miss out on the knockup potential it provides. Your **Ultimate** will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your maneuvers to keep them alive longer. If your allies quickly die, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Get level 2 before the enemy and look for an aggressive play while the enemy is still level 1.\n\nWait for the enemy laner to use their dashes before using your Hook b. It\u2019s important that you do not waste this ability in lane as you\u2019ll be no threat to the enemy while it\u2019s on cooldown. By waiting for them to use their dash, your chances of landing the ability are increased.\n\nLook for roaming opportunities to try and get your allies ahead. Your champion is a good roamer, so you can do it very easily."}
{"text": "As shyvana, That's because she has no form of reliable engagement and therefore needs powerfarm. She is very dependent on her articles to get on the front line during the end-of-game fights. If she's defeated early, she can't last too long after diving into the enemy team. She's very vulnerable when her Ultimate t is down. She's quite inclined to ganks when she's laning as her ace doesn't provide her with as much mobility."}
{"text": "As taric, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Be cautious around the minion wave as Yasuo will often use his E to dash through the minion wave to get on to you. Stand outside and away from the minion wave at all times.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing as a ranged champion, try to use your range advantage to harass and poke him down. Do not over-commit to doing this though as he could look to turn the exchange around.\n\nPlaying around Yasuo\u2019s Windwall W will make killing him a lot easier. If you can, try to bait this ability out before committing to the all-in."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Look to assassinate enemies with your Ultimate R. Catching someone while he's going to the hall or moving from one track to the other is a great way to move forward. Focus on securing goals when possible in the middle of the game. You can take them alone or with your team. Look for choices on enemies who are too far ahead or alone. You can get on them just before they are able to react thanks to your Passive."}
{"text": "As jayce, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to withdraw you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Use your s to harass the enemy as much as possible before engaging in the team fight."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, It can allow it to juke as well as to initiate ganks with ease. This is particularly effective when it has its Sweeper activated, or the enemy team has no vision set-up. It unlocks its real power when it gets its Ultimate n. It can easily allow it to control the non-suspecting target crowd and set up its team for the success and monitoring of crowd control. It excels in the extended trades because of the way its k and s work. This allows it to dull enemies easily, especially if they are overstretched."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, His waveclear and burst damage is impeccable. He can also keep poking the opposition with his W and set some Q turrets in the lane brushes/around him to prevent all-ins.\n\nHe can push up freely as long as he is in the cover of his Q turrets. These turrets, when combined with his E, can allow Heimerdinger to turn an enemy gank into an easy kill for him.\n\nHis Ultimate R provides him with a lot of versatility. He can use his empowered Q to take down turrets and enemies, his empowered W to take down low health enemies, and his empowered E to set a multi-man, long-ranged CC which can allow his team to follow up on his CC."}
{"text": "As lux, After your bot track has moved to the middle track, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. Try to sit goals with your team during the middle game. You have strong botking tools that will allow you to sit goals with ease. Try to bring down the enemy as much as possible while your team tries to take turns (or the Dragon or Baron)."}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen gains global map pressure at level 6 as his Ultimate R can be used to help any of his allies. With this in mind, ping once he hits level 6.\n\nShen is actually strong at level 2 if he can get a good engage off with his E. He can be strong at level 1 if he starts E too.\n\nHe is really good in the mid-game as his kit is very versatile and can be used to either start fights, bait enemies and save his allies. He will also be stronger as the game goes along as he will get tankier and tankier."}
{"text": "As zilean, Zilean should stick to his team as glue as his Ultimate t will cause the fall of the enemy team, provided he uses the ability correctly. The lower cooldown will certainly make prolonged fights a breeze for Zilean's team. Zilean will go max. from his Ultimate t to level 16. This will allow him to have a tiny cooldown on his Ultimate t. On the other hand, the health with which the Ultimate t'd target respawns will increase. He will have all his articles by this point of the game. This means that his damage release will be massive, especially when it comes to his Q > W > Q combo. A single Q on a squishy target can easily pick them up."}
{"text": "As hecarim, He can easily be killed if he goes in without his Ultimate t and gets CC\u2019d by the enemy team. This will allow the enemy ranged carries to kite and kill him while the enemy tanks keep him away from their carries.\n\nThe enemy can completely counter him if they play in open spaces like the lane and are properly spaced when Hecarim goes in. This will prevent Hecarim from fearing the entire team and will allow the enemy team to retaliate.\n\nHecarim won\u2019t be able to flank the enemy freely if the enemy team sets proper vision around the lane they are fighting. This will force Hecarim to engage upon the enemy team in a direct fashion, which will allow the enemy team to react accordingly."}

It can help you survive near-death situations, especially if you are targeting the enemy backline. Just make sure that you activate your Passive before dying."}
{"text": "As zac, Xin Zhao will have two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. It will allow him to use the ability more often, which will make it easier for him to convert fighting to 1 v 1 as and when necessary. His first ability will be maximized at the time he reaches level 9. It is a crucial peak of power because he massively increases his damage production and duel ability. Xin is excellent in team fighting and collecting enemies because of his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to distinguish enemies, allowing him to be immune to various maneuvers."}
{"text": "As senna, Get level 2 first and look for a favourable trade. Gaining an early health lead is key to getting a kill later on down the line. Level 2 in the bottom lane is the first minion wave followed by the next 3 melee minions.\n\nYour goal during the laning phase is to look for kills and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to gain a lead.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As vladimir, Has no form of gank agency so will probably not get a gank during the early game. He is quite weak early on as well and is quite useless if the game doesn\u2019t go on for too long. \n\nMisuse of his l can get him killed immediately, especially if the enemy laner holds on to their main crowd control ability. This can make him a very easy gank target.\n\nGrievous Wounds are a bane to his existence, especially if it is procured early.

Lux will try to delay a team fight so she can poke with her l or get a pick with her g. "}
{"text": "Against lillia, Post 6, fighting Lillia alone could be difficult as she can use her Ultimate R to protect herself or turn around the exchange. Avoid committing to fight unless you are certain that you can kill her quickly. Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early will force her to extend for the farm that you can abuse to all of it or set up your Jungler. Look out for Lillia. It has a very versatile construction path and will build many different items. Keep this in mind and buy items that counter-built it."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is perfect during this stage as team fights frequently occur, which gives her multiple targets to land her abilities on. As a result, she will dish out tons of damage while healing up during a major fight.\n\nGwen will get a massive boost to her fighting power at level 11 due to her Ultimate R now having two points. It is highly beneficial for her team as that ability does a lot of damage and can completely change the tide of a fight.\n\nAt level nine, Gwen will be able to max out her Q. That ability is her paramount damage ability, and it will start dishing out a lot of damage from now. As a result, her enemies will have a hard time dealing with her now."}

You cannot match her roams in the early game. Instead it is better for you to just focus on farming.\n"}
{"text": "As vayne, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. It will not be able to use its E much if it is pushed up.

During the middle of the game, Darius should have completed some articles. He should be able to do a lot of damage to the targets, and also be a bit tanky. The articles he picks up make him a huge problem during this stage of the game."}

As your team will be grouped closely together, he will be able to land devastating blows with his s and this could cost you your team the objective and your lives. \n\nIf Jayce is in a side lane split pushing, make sure you keep an eye on his positioning at all times.

{"text": "As quinn, Watch the map properly, you don't want to get trapped by someone who has his team waiting. Focus the closest enemy champion on your carts and work as a team to get the enemy down one by one. If you focus only on the rear line, you can be an easy target for the enemy and die quickly. By focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive. You have to stay with your team in the late game.

{"text": "Against viktor, Avoid fighting around the goals because Viktor has a lot of poke with his y. His Ultimate m also inflicts AOE damage that will help him force you away from the goal. Viktor's work in team fights is poke as much as he can before engaging in the fight. Try to force a fight as quickly as you can rather than allow him to shoot you down with his y and m. In team fights, flancing on the side or creating different angles of approach to go to him. It will make it really hard for him to survive the team fight."}
{"text": "As shen, The second point of his Ultimate R will increase the amount of shield and reduce the ability cooling. Both are beneficial to Shen and his team. His tankness will be prominent during this phase of the game. Combined with his W and Q, this will make it really difficult for the enemy to kill him. Level 9 is when his first ability will be maximized. This will allow him to do a lot of damage to the enemies he managed to catch. It will also allow him not to cause damage to the enemy team while inflicting a decent amount of damage in return."}

It has a great poke thanks to its Q, W and R that will make it difficult for your team to secure the goal easily.

Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate n in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate n is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}

Gangplank will eventually overtake you in the progress of the game, so putting it back will make it harder for him to take control of the card.

This is because the empowerments will be more powerful, and Heimerdinger will use them both offensively and defensively. In addition, it will let him harass the enemy laner relentlessly when they are trying to farm in the lane.\n\nHeimerdinger excels during team fights as he can control a large area with his Q turrets.

{"text": "As ezreal, The junglers can camp it at this stage as well as it will no longer have any other form of escape, and its E has a very long cooling period. It takes enough time for its itemization to work. It also depends on the fact that it is very skillful to shoot hard and that it will have to place its Qs on the enemy to be effective. Bouffer its E won=t works too well if the enemy has some form of varied CC that it can use to follow on Ezreal after using its E. This obliges it to play a little more defensively, and it cannot push in the wave either, otherwise it can be crushed by the enemy."}

{"text": "As anivia, In the last game, the damage to Anivia will be really horrible. She will have several items finished, and her Ultimate m will inflict tons of constant damage. The teams will continue to regroup in the last game. This helps Anivia as she can land a 5 person t, and her Ultimate m is an AOE tool. This means that she can inflict a lot of damage to the targets if they are grouped closely. In the last game, Anivia will have very few cooldowns on most of her abilities. She will be able to look for more frequent choices and secure kills with her team. Her t, in particular, will be on a very low cooldown in the last game."}

Try to secure it before he gets the chance to gank a nearby lane and take it with their help."}
{"text": "As sion, Getting to level 3 will be quite important in this matchup so ask for a hard leash and quickly erase the Jungle. Once you are level 3, you can start to glove. Try to initiate the ganks using your E to slow down the overheard enemies. This will mean that you will need gank when a new wave of minion appears. In the first levels, play safe and avoid engaging in any duel. Your game early is pretty weak, so you'll probably lose jobs against an aggressive jungler."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is perfect during this stage because team fights often happen, which gives him multiple targets to land on his abilities. As a result, she carries tons of damage while healing in a major fight. Gwen will get a massive boost to his combat power at level 11 due to her Ultimate R now having two points. This is very beneficial for his team as this ability causes a lot of damage and can completely change the tide of a fight."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Exchange with Xerath when his 2 or r is on cooldown. When he does not have one of these abilities, he is vulnerable to attack. Investing in early maintenance and protection will help deal with Xeraths poke in the way. A Rechargeable Potion would not go wrong in this matchup. For utility supports, take Relic Shield instead of Spellthief."}
{"text": "As lulu, Avoid detaching from your ally if Lulu's W (Whimsy) capability is available, as it can polymorphize you and disrupt your movements. Keep the wave closer to your side of the way to create opportunities for jungle ganks and increase your safety. After Level 6, it becomes more difficult to secure the dead on Lulu or its ADC due to its ultimate (Wild Growth) providing additional health and strike effect."}
{"text": "As tristana, His field of attack will be quite high during this phase of the game. He will let her get out of a lot of damage while remaining safe from CC. Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to inflict more damage and strengthen the arrival movement. It will be on a low cooling which means that she can use it quite frequently. This step of the game is made or broken for Trist. It can be strong, but if it is not early, it will be absolutely weak."}
{"text": "Against corki, Corki will try to delay a team and poke fight with his b and e. If you engage and fight quickly, he won't have time to shoot you down. Avoid trying to take goals in the middle or end of the game when Corki is alive. He'll just knock you down while you're trying to take them. Make sure you take them when he's dead or somewhere else on the map. Fighting Corki can be difficult alone, so your best bet is to focus on matching his wave power and try to prevent him from taking these secondary goals."}
{"text": "As riven, Extremely weak when she is CC\u2019d as she can\u2019t use her dashes and can be killed easily. This allows the enemy team to pick her off before a major fight or when her e is on cooldown.\n\nToo steep of a learning curve, which makes it very hard for new players to master this champion. Effectiveness is reduced if the player can\u2019t cancel Auto-attack animations.\n\nVery hard for her to come back into the game if she falls behind early on. Very useful for the enemy team to gank her when she is pushed up or dive her when her r is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As jhin, It is important that you stick with your team in the late game. Do not move around the map or go anywhere unless someone is with you.\n\nStand towards the back end of your team near your Support. Avoid walking too far away from anyone in the late game. Getting caught out will result in the enemy being able to push their advantage and finish the game.\n\nWatch your positioning in the late game. Focus on kiting and auto-attacking the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so you do not get caught out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "As shen, Able to mitigate any form of auto-attack damage with his W. This can make the enemy physical damage carries to be practically useless when this ability is active.\n\nHe can set really good cheese brushes as well as all-in opportunities with his E. When combined with certain items, Shen can put additional debuffs on the taunted champions with ease.\n\nHis Ultimate R can allow him to act as a guardian for his teammates. This becomes really beneficial if one of Shen\u2019s teammates is fed and needs to be peeled for."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Use the lane brushes to regularly land your e on the enemy. This will soon let you chunk your enemy out of the lane.\n\nYour e needs to be used with extreme discretion in this matchup. Ensure that the enemy has no form of CC on them before you decide to use the ability amid a fight,\n\nOnce you unlock your Ultimate r, you should have a really easy time running enemies down not only in your lane but also in other lanes. Ensure that you do whatever is necessary to get a lead.        "}
{"text": "As lillia, Lillia is very fast and mobile thanks to her Passive. This makes it difficult to catch her out of position. It will also allow you to avoid skill shots and CC. Unlike many AP champions, Lillia can launch and start a team fight if she can catch several enemies out of position with her E. Ping once you activate your Ultimate R so your team knows you want to enter. It is possible that you are able to put the entire enemy team to sleep with your Ultimate R. This will increase the chances of your winning team. Try to apply your Ultimate R to as many champions as possible."}
{"text": "As zyra, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nLook for picks in the mid-game. You deal lots of damage and can easily blow champions up. Try to kill someone and then abuse their death timer to earn more gold."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Look for an aggressive level 1 game. They can easily try to get you down if you exceed. Try your toughest poke and harass the enemy, but don't engage in it because they can turn around an exchange easily. Level 6 of enemies is not very strong in 2v2 fights as their Ultimate R is a utility tool."}
{"text": "As morgana, Morgana is quite decent in team fights as she will be able to run down enemies with her Q and Ultimate R. Her E will allow her to ave her allies from hard CC and engages.\n\nAdding 2 points in her Ultimate R will give her a massive power spike. She will be able to use the ability frequently, impacting team fights often.\n\nAt level nine, her Q will be maxed out. It will let her get frequent picks on the enemy, especially from the fog of war. "}
{"text": "Against sejuani, You can reduce Sejuani's ability to get successful ganks by monitoring its entrances into the jungle or by placing pupils in the river. If you know where it is, she will be unable to get good ganks. Sejuani has good Drake control in early play. Make sure you take the crab from the bottom side and keep the Drake monitored at all times so that she is unable to hide it away from your team. Once Sejuani reaches level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, she will look for gank as often as she can. You could delay this peak of power by invading him in early play or flying her camps when she is spotted on the other side of the map."}
{"text": "As swain, His early play is excellent as he can completely CC and blow up an enemy target when necessary. Using the brush line will allow him to reap a lot of benefits. Level six is an excellent peak as he can now control the pace of a team struggle. He can easily be between the enemy team while treating a lot of health and regenerate a lot of health in return. The first element will allow him to spam his abilities frequently and deposit a lot of damage."}
{"text": "Against hwei, Avoid letting Hwei land free poke on you. Buying early boots can help shun his abilities. Avoid fighting in the jungle as it has a lot of AOE damage, and will of course build AP items, so it will do a lot of damage. Run it as it tries to keep it alone in the middle of the game. Withdrawal can allow your team to get the Baron or another major goal."}
{"text": "As sylas, You are way stronger than Sylas early. Invade him and try to fight him in the 1v1.\n\nMake sure you apply as much pressure as possible by ganking often in the early game.\n\nRemember to take those objectives. Unlike Sylas, you can solo those objectives quite easily.\n\nIf you see Sylas ganking nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to counter gank. You\u2019re a really strong counter-ganker!\n"}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Try to fight as a team in the open air so that he is unable to use his E qualified to stun your entire team. Do not fight in the jungle because the size of his E is about the same as the jungle. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, he technically unlocks 3 new abilities. Be careful trying to initiate a skirmish with him because he could just remove his magic card and kill you."}
{"text": "As reksai, Its first ganks are pretty good because it can find creative gank paths easily. It must make sure that it is not detected in advance, however. Level 6 is a good peak as it is a good finishing movement. The goal is either to get killed on weak health targets or to avoid CC and to access the enemy rear line. The first element will help in the duels, and the Jungle becomes clear. It becomes easy enough for Rek'Sai to move quickly around the map."}
{"text": "Against ekko, When invading Ekko, try to wait inside a bush for him to use his W (and wait for it to expire) before going on to him. When his shield is down, he is much weaker and easier to kill.\n\nTry and place vision inside the river and around his jungle entrances. This will make it harder for him to gank successfully if you always know his approximate location. Having vision in lane bushes will also help prevent ganks as you can spot him setting up his W.\n\nEkko doesn\u2019t have the healthiest of clears even with his W. If you are a strong dueler, look to invade his jungle and shut him down in the early game."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, A maximum-out Ultimate R will generally have a shorter cooling time than a Quicksilver Sash. This means that no one is safe, and it can choose high priority targets during team fighting. It will have several items during this phase of the game, allowing it to take a lot of damage and inflicting a lot of damage simultaneously during a fight. It will be difficult for the enemy to take it down. The enemies will stack defensive items, so it will become difficult for you to kill them. That being said, separating the enemy door from the real map for a few seconds will help your team to win a fight quickly."}
{"text": "As akali, After Akali has picked up her first component item, the damage output from her Q will increase dramatically. Look to trade more often after your first back.\n\nOnce you have access to all your basic abilities, you can start to trade more effectively with the enemy. At level 3, you can look for more aggressive plays, but don\u2019t over commit to them, so you don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nAt level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as her Ultimate offers her a lot of additional kill pressure. Look for kills with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends."}
{"text": "As akali, Akali lacks energy quite easily. You will need to keep a constant eye on your energy levels and go only for aggressive games when you have a lot of energy. Akali and assassins like his fight against the teams with a lot of CC. In the team fights, you will have to wait for the perfect opportunity to enter to not get CC. Akali is one of the most difficult champions to master in the game. Playing around his energy levels, his Passive, his W and his two mobility spells takes a lot of practice. Expect to put in a lot of effort if you want to learn Akali."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Always watch your positioning during the laning phase. Try and stay at max distance so it\u2019s harder for her to root you with her E. This will also make it harder for her to get a good Ultimate R off as she has to close the gap in order to stun you.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave at all times if possible. This will make it harder for Neeko to push and poke you at the same time with her Q.\n\nOnce Neeko has her Ultimate R, her kill pressure will increase. Make sure you back when low whenever she has her Ultimate R up."}
{"text": "Against khazix, Kha\u2019Zix will try and assassinate targets that are alone during the mid-game. Avoid walking through the river alone if you\u2019re unsure where Kha\u2019Zix is.\n\nCrowd control is a necessity when playing against Kha\u2019Zix as it reduces his assassination and jump E potential. Try to lock Kha\u2019Zix down as soon as he jumps E in to prevent him from getting in and out.\n\nGrouping closely together will make it harder for Kha\u2019Zix to deal tons of damage as he will not get bonus damage from his Passive when targets are grouped."}
{"text": "As ryze, At this stage of the game, you want to get into a secondary track and focus on agriculture so you have a stronger game late. In the later parts of the middle game and when the enemy starts to group, make sure to follow the sequence and start grouping with your team. Use your ultimate R to get choices with your allies on enemies who are isolated or separated from their team. If you can catch someone, try to take the Dragon or Baron after."}
{"text": "As sion, Its ultimate R can be used to install ganks on other tracks. No one suspects a Sion from the base and down or midway. Its E is a very easy skill to land that guarantees a Sion Q. This can be of great value for setting up ganks for its Jungler."}
{"text": "Against nunu, If you invade Nunu, don't fight it when it's near a jungle camp because it can use Q to gain a health benefit. Ideally, fight it when it's in the river or not near a camp. Nunu can easily solo the Dragon on level 4 and after. Be ready for that by keeping the Dragon at all times and always taking the lower side Crab Scuttle. At level 6, Nunu can channel his R. When he does, make sure you cancel it or interrupt it. If you can interrupt his channel early, his R won't do much damage and it could save you or your allies. Cancel his R with CC."}
{"text": "As briar, Make sure that you get to level 3 really fast in this game. It will allow you to execute ganks easily and get a quick lead over the enemy.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should look for picks all around the map.\n\nAfter getting your first item, you need to look for more fights with the enemy Jungler or laners to abuse your early strength.\n"}
{"text": "As veigar, At this stage of the game, you want to get into a side track and focus on getting piles so you have a stronger game late. In the later parts of the middle game and when the enemy starts to group, make sure to follow up and start grouping with your team. Look for choices with your n. If you can catch someone during the middle game with it, your team should be able to kill them pretty quickly. Once you've killed someone, make the call for Drake or Baron."}
{"text": "As illaoi, Try your hardest to earn as much gold as possible. The more gold Illaoi earns, the harder she will be to deal with in the later parts of the laning phase/ game.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, you can look for an all-in or go for a kill. Try to get them low before doing so though.\n\nPoke the enemy as often as possible with your E and Q. If you can get them low and play around your Tentacle placements, your ability to get a kill in lane will increase."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Watch your positioning in the late game. Focus on kiting and auto-attacking the nearest enemy champion.

{"text": "As viego, Viego can steal the lives of his enemies which can allow him to escape danger. As he becomes untargetable, it can allow him to dodge incoming damage. \n\nViego is a fun and rewarding champion to play thanks to his Passive and his Ultimate R.

Keep playing him and see yourself skyrocket in the ranks\n"}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Trendamere is not so good if it is behind and weak in gold. It needs a lot of gold and XP to carry solo in the later parts of the game. Whenever its Ultimate e is in decline, it is quite vulnerable which makes it (somewhat a little) weaker. Can be kited quite easily and is prone to disengage/CC in team fighting. This can make the team fight difficult for a Trendamere."}
{"text": "Against sion, Sion has a deceptively powerful laning phase. So be careful of his Q poke. Try dodging it by moving left or right instead of walking backwards.\n\nPost 6, Sion has good gank set up and can escape ganks quite easily. His kill pressure also increases, so be mindful of his level 6 power spike.\n\nExtended trades do not work in Sion\u2019s favour. If you can bait out an ability, you could look to trade and abuse his cooldowns to get him low."}
{"text": "As sion, Ward the lane brushes at all costs in this matchup. Sion can easily CC you from them and you won't even know about it.\n\nKeep track of his ult noise and see which lane he is ganking. If he goes for some other lane, just get some tower plates.\n\nDuring fights, make sure that you don't let him CC anyone. Both your ult and your tankiness should facilitate this and you can play the fight out with relative ease..\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo will place Shrooms t around the edges of the lane. Avoid walking to the side of the lane and only walk the path your minions take to reduce the damage taken.\n\nFocusing Teemo down is a great way of winning this matchup. He is super squishy and easy to kill if you play around his t.\n\nPlaying around his t is very important. If you don\u2019t, he is going to outtrade you every time. Bait it out and then play aggressive while it\u2019s down."}
{"text": "As zeri, Be a part of as many fights as you can during this phase of the game. Your Q and W should make life easy for your team. Do not ignore the field aspect of your W. It can come in really practical situations where you fight around choking points. Your Ultimate R will be game change so make sure your E is ready to escape or dash after throwing the ability. It will catch the out-of-guard enemy."}
{"text": "As jax, After the laning phase has ended, go to a different lane (or stay top) and just split push. You\u2019re a good split pusher and can draw a lot of attention to your lane.\n\nIf somebody tries to contest your split push, look to fight them. Jax is a good duelist and will be able to fight most enemies who try to stop him.\n\nWhile you\u2019re a champion that is usually sent to split push, you might need to group with your team if the enemy is trying to force something. Be prepared to rotate around the map and help them fight."}
{"text": "As ahri, Using your Q, try to hit both the minions and the enemy to maximize the effectiveness of this ability. You're not very mobile before you get your Ultimate, so always keep track of the position of the enemy Jungler. Sew the wall in front of the side where the enemy Jungler was last seen. Once you unlock your Ultimate, it's time to start wandering and secure the dead elsewhere after pushing the wave. Sometimes, the enemy lantern can follow you. If they do it without vision, just hide in the jungle and kill them when they walk too close to you."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, In team fights, as soon as Aatrox runs in, try to CC him and burst him down first. He is pretty vulnerable to CC and if you can kill him before he gets his combo off, the enemy will lose out on a lot of damage.\n \nTry to look for fights when Aatrox doesn\u2019t have his Ultimate or Flash. He will have a much harder time at impacting fights when either of these are on cooldown.\n \nAatrox likes to split push after the laning phase has ended. When he shows in a side lane alone, you could try and start a team fight with his teammates. Have wards on that side of the map though just in case he makes his way to join the fight."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Flanking Xerath might be the best way to handle him in team fights. Try to attack from the sides and take him down quickly so he is unable to dish out damage. \n\nDo not let Xerath poke you down before a team fight occurs. Xerath\u2019s goal is to delay a team fight for as long as possible while he pokes with his p and 2. Don\u2019t let him do this by engaging as soon as you can. \n\nDo not go for objectives when Xerath is nearby. He can poke you down at the Dragon or Baron, and stop you from sieging his Towers. Taking objectives like Dragon, Baron and Towers will be easier when Xerath is nowhere nearby."}
{"text": "Against udyr, Udyr is a strong dueller in the early game. Unless you have a clear advantage, avoid fighting him in a 1v1 scenario.\n\nUdyr has good objective control and can solo objectives like the Dragon with ease. Make sure you keep the Drake warded at all times to decrease his chances of securing them for free.\n\nUnlike most champions, he doesn\u2019t peak at level 6 as he can unlock his Ultimate R at level 1. If you have a strong Ultimate, try to abuse the cooldown and help your allies."}
{"text": "As camille, During the mid game, you will hit level 11 and put an additional point in your Ultimate. Make sure you play around its cooldown and try to get kills with it.\n\nAt level 9, you would max your first ability. Your trading potential will increase dramatically.\n\nYou will have multiple items completed in the mid-game. After your first item, you will be a lot stronger, and when you have 2, you will be a fierce opponent.\n"}
{"text": "As sejuani, Focus on farming and hitting level 6 as quickly as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your ganking potential.\n\nYour Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Whenever it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get kills.\n\nTry to secure objectives with your team. If you can, try to keep it warded at all times if you\u2019re not in a position to take it yourself."}
{"text": "As neeko, When there is no team fight, go on a side track and push. You have to keep growing during the middle of the game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Don't stay just in the middle if you can't get anything done. Flank in the team fights to get the enemy backline up easier. Use your W to speed up to get off a good Ultimate R. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and maybe take a turn, a goal or get more murders."}
{"text": "As lux, Very immobile and can be killed almost immediately if she is caught out without her g. Layered CC will make her absolutely useless.\n\nShe is somewhat item reliant, so camping and killing her a lot during the early game will just make her a shield bot during the late game.\n\nShe can be picked off easily by the enemy team if she wanders too far from her team, or when she is trying to take the Blue Buff. She will also be very weak against complete all-ins from the enemy team."}
{"text": "As kennen, It can be shot down gradually, which will force it to get out of the way, or it can be all-in-one by the enemy lantern and the Jungler/Support. Once its h is lowered, it becomes a gank target if it is too pushed. This will allow its laner to get a free murder on it, especially if its laner manages to use a wave management technique to bait Kennen. Reliefs on the flanks to obtain team battle victories so good vision on the enemy side. This will prevent it from entering the backline of the enemy team and doing huge damage."}
{"text": "Against belveth, In team fights, try to lock it fast so that it is unable to self-attack and flatten tons of damage. When it activates its E in a team fight, avoid using bursting abilities. Disengage it or concentrate it quickly to get it down. If it exceeds or uses its Q too aggressively, lock it up and focus it in the team fight. Quickly exit it will increase your chances of winning the game."}
{"text": "Against bard, Do not group closely during the middle of the game that Bard can use his Ultimate R to catch several champions. Being struck by his Ultimate R can allow his team either to kill the enemies caught or to concentrate the enemies that are not gold. Because Bard. Q can stun the enemies who are near a wall, be ready to take an alternative road by walking towards the Dragon or Baron. Being stunned and killed before a big goal will have the result that the enemy takes the goal for free. Overstaying then low under your own turn is a big no-no against Bard. Thanks to his Ultimate R, he can put your Tour in the stasis and kill you soon after."}
{"text": "As ahri, Ahri \u00e8s Passive offers her additional support in the way that can help her survive even the hardest matchups. Although healing is not much, it can be impacted. Thanks to Ahri \u00e8s E, she has great selection potential throughout all the stages of the game. When used in conjunction with her R, she will be able to catch the enemies out of position and increase her gold lead. In team fights, your mobility is pretty great. With your Ultimate, you are able to flank the enemy on the side, get a murder and then escape before anyone is able to catch you."}
{"text": "As volibear, Once it unlocks its basic capabilities, it should easily ruin any track where the enemy is overstretched. Level 6 is an important peak of power for Volibbear. It is mainly due to its ability to initiate independent fighting and to instigate tower dives with ease. Any unhealthy target will be forced to play safely and to suddenly remember. Volibbear's objective control is good too. It can quickly clean its camps and take neutral goals with ease if an opportunity arises. Its E will help him a lot by taking these goals."}
{"text": "Against zyra, Zyra is strong at level 3 because she has access to her two Qs and Es. Expects that she will take a lot of damage in a job. Once Zyra reaches level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, her death pressure increases considerably and she can shoot the most squishi of the champions."}
{"text": "As naafiri, Your first power peak is at level 3 when you unlock the 3 of your basic capabilities. You can start looking to fight at level 3 from. When you unlock your Ultimate, roaming and all-in will be easier and you will be more of a threat. After you finish your first component, you will be strong enough in 1v1s and have a greater chance of getting killed."}
{"text": "As taric, Take advantage of your range advantage and harass Taric regularly whenever possible. Use your automatic attacks and abilities to push him down and exert pressure in the way. Be ready to use your E (Zoomies) ability to reposition and swindle Taric's E (Dazzle) stunning. This will help you avoid being taken out of position and mitigate his crowd control. If possible, try to keep the minion closer to your side of the map. This forces Taric and his ADC to extend for the farm, creating opportunities for your jungler to capitalize and potentially secure murders or call spells. Make sure that you and your ADC reach level 2 at the same time as Taric. Taric can seek to engage and fight early at level 2, so it is important to be ready and ready to respond."}
{"text": "Against renata, Do not fight in the jungle as teams will be grouped closely together. It\u2019s best to fight in the open so she cannot land a 5 person Ultimate R.\n\nSimilarly, do not fight around objectives either as your team will be grouped together which can allow her to get a huge Ultimate R off and win the fight.\n\nWard your flanks as she might use her Ultimate R from the side so it\u2019s harder for your team to react to it."}
{"text": "As zac, Chokepoint fights and fights initiated from the fog of war will be vital for you. Your ability to keep the enemies zoned out is next to none, and hence you should not let them come close to the objective pits.\n\nYou will be really tanky during this phase of the game so make sure that you initiate fights for your team. Let your team know before you all in, though, and keep track of your Passive.\n\nSeparate the enemy backline from the enemy frontline as this will let your allies play more freely and will keep them safe from the damage dealt by the enemy backline. Try to deal with the tanks first as you deal more damage to them."}
{"text": "Against brand, Try and stay behind the minion wave but not in it. This will force Brand to choose between harassing you with his W or pushing the wave. This is also a good place to stand as the minions will block his Q.\n\nDon\u2019t let Brand harass you for free. Try and stand back and out of range of him so he\u2019s unable to attack and harass you with his W. Ensure that you remain healthy otherwise you\u2019ll never be able to fight him.\n\nA good time to fight Brand is when he\u2019s out of mana or has an ability on cooldown. This will make trading much better for you as he will not be able to dish out a lot of damage (or possibly stun you if his Q is on cooldown) as he\u2019ll have 1 less ability to use."}
{"text": "As rell, Rell can destroy the shields thanks to his Q. This makes it an excellent tool against the champions with a lot of shielding. Rell. Ultimate R is an excellent team combat tool because it can allow him to CC several enemies at once. Try to use it on as many champions as possible: preferably when they are grouped closely together. You can look for sneaky contacts with your E. Put it on the front line, let them hire and then E and CC the enemy team!"}
{"text": "As annie, If you're not early, don't worry because you'll always be able to protect your ADC with your E. Annie is a great team combat champion and as the teams will regroup in the end of the game. This allows her to get a multi-person R. Although Annie has a lot of brilliant damage, she starts to fall in the end of the game as the squishy champions start building defensive objects."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Once he adds two points to his Ultimate r, his death pressure will increase significantly due to the amount of damage inflicted by this ability. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This offers a lot of death pressure for Tahm Kench, and he can try to search more frequently for all-in and roams on the supertensive enemies. Tahm will have completed several articles during this stage of the game. This means that he will die much less while increasing the amount of constant damage he inflicts on enemies during the all-in."}
{"text": "As kalista, It is important that you stay with your team in the late game. Do not move around the card or go anywhere unless someone is with you. Stand back from your team near your support. Avoid walking too far from anyone in the late game. Being caught will lead the enemy will be able to push his advantage and finish the game. Look at your positioning in the late game. Focus on the kiting and automatic attack of the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so that you are not taken out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "As nasus, Try to pull the pressure while your team is able to get something done elsewhere on the map. Be ready to group with your team when you are unable to get more goals alone. When you are fighting the team, make sure to peel for your carriers. Use your W to slow down the enemy front line and then focus the closest enemy champion in the fight."}
{"text": "Against sivir, Sivir is very strong once she has tons of crit. This makes her pretty strong during the mid and late game.\n\nOnce Sivir unlocks her Ultimate R, her kill pressure increase but not in a usual 2v2 fight. As it\u2019s a utility tool, it allows her to chase you down or hard engage with her Jungler. Expect her to get ganks post 6.\n\nSivir is really good in team fights as her Ultimate R can help her team catch out enemies who are overextended or out of position. Avoid splitting up or overextending in the later stages of the game."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Very squishy and can be easily burst down when his E is down. Junglers can camp him at that stage as well since he will have no other form of escape left, and his E has a very long cooldown.\n\nTakes quite some time to scale up due to how his itemization works. This is also dependent on the fact that he is very skill shot heavy and will need to land his Qs on the enemy in order to be effective.\n\nBuffering his E won\u2019t work too well if the enemy has some form of ranged CC which they can use to follow-up on Ezreal after he has used his E. This forces him to play a bit more defensively, and he won\u2019t be able to push in the wave either, else he can get run down by the enemy."}
{"text": "As zeri, Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card early. After getting your first item, you can start pushing a little bit more. Abuse your Q range for poke and clear waves. Avoid being in the range of its (so play at the maximum range) to reduce all-in. Poke when it's out of the minion wave early, but when you have your first item, target your abilities so they hit it and the minion wave at the same time. Playing around your Ultimate is very important. It will be crucial to help you get killed and win the way. Get your Jungler for you gank if you can't kill them yourself."}
{"text": "Against sett, Expecting that Sett will snuggle in a team fight or use Hexflash to cross a wall and catch someone with his E or Ultimate R. Avoid regrouping closely as this can allow Sett to get a multi-person E that will help his team win the team fight. Slightly split up will be better for you in the long run. Don't walk too far by sitting a goal as Sett can use his Ultimate R to pick up the closest champion and throw them into their allies behind them. If you are bundled and online with each other, it will be harder for him to do so."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Master Yi needs time to come online. He is really weak in the very early laning phase.\n\nHis level 6 power spike is quite potent. If he can go for short trades prior to hitting level 6, he can easily chase the enemy down and all-in them with his Ultimate r.\n\nWhen Master Yi has completed his first component item, he will find it alot easier to secure CS and win auto-attack trades with the enemy laner.\n"}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is hard to play in a variety of champions. They can constantly harass and intimidate him which will make him difficult to survive the early game. Your Q will only be as impacted as you do. If you use your Q without multiple piles, the damage will be futile. His W does not block turn shots, but it increases his defensive stats."}
{"text": "As elise, As well as her level 6, Elise does not point to level 11. Again, keep this in mind during the fight against the enemy Junglers at level 11. At level 9, Elise maximizes her Q. This is a good top level for Elise because it allows her to exceed most of the enemy Junglers in a 1v1 fight. In the middle of the game, Elise should have completed several articles. She will be good in the middle of the game, and with the most articles she gets."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of mana problems in the early game, but once she gets Tear of the Goddess she will play a lot more aggressive.\n\nCassiopeia really shines in the late game. She scales better than most champs and she can build 6 items. If you get ahead early- try closing out the game as soon as possible.\n\nNot many champions are as strong as Cassiopeia is at level 2. Beware of the level 2 all-in with her Q and E spam."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early will help reduce Xin Zhao\u2019s kill pressure in lane and increase your chances of surviving in bad matchups.\n\nInvesting in healing reduction will help you a ton against Xin Zhao as he tends to have a lot of sustain in lane and throughout the game.\n\nXin Zhao is strong in the early game. Expect him to go for aggressive plays in attempts to get an early lead. "}
{"text": "Against senna, The extended trades against Senna will help you in the long run. She doesn't have the best support and her automatic attack speed is very low. Capitalize on this by looking for long-wind trades when possible. Expect Senna to go for an aggressive level 1 game to get batteries. Try not to let her poke get you down too much otherwise you won't be able to trade at level 2 or 3. Once Senna unlocks her Ultimate R, contact your team and tell them that she can impact a fight with her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As lulu, This champion is quite motionless and is subject to CC. If they get caught by any CC, they will probably die. Less transport potential compared to many other Supports. Lulu relies on her team to carry while she provides them with healings and shields. Lulu is a squishy champion with low points of success. This makes her rather vulnerable and easy to kill. Choosing your fights and avoiding constant trading is the key to winning."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana is really weak until level six as she has no reliable way of ganking enemies. She should focus on farming and getting to level six as quickly as possible to start impacting fights.\n\nWhen Shyvana picks up her first item component, it will allow her to clear camps quickly and deal a lot of damage during duels. It will help her blow her enemies up once she gets her Ultimate t too.\n\nHer objective control is really great due to the speed with which she can capture the objectives. She will just need to set vision around beforehand so that she can track the enemy Jungler.        "}
{"text": "Against leona, Leona\u2019s level 2 power spike is very strong. Make sure you hit level 2 at the same time so you can trade back with her incase she engages.\n\nOnce Leona has Mobility Boots, she can roam with ease. As soon as she leaves lane, ping your teammates so they know she\u2019s missing.\n\nAt level 6, Leona\u2019s kill pressure increases as she can use her Ultimate e from afar to lock you down. Play respectfully and do not push up if you are without Flash."}
{"text": "As gragas, Focus on securing the remaining Dragons / Rift Herald in the middle of the game. Get as many Drakes as possible will increase your chances of winning the game. Peel for your team in the team fights. After using your Ultimate R, peel for your allies to keep them alive. You can flank and use your Ultimate R to catch prolonged targets and hit them in your team to start the fight. In particular, try to hit the enemy backline forward in your team."}
{"text": "As pantheon, His E allows him to avoid a lot of damage and can act as a huge factor during all the ins. That's why he can transform fighting in his favor especially when he is weak in health. Can easily poke and execute someone with his Q due to how this ability works. This when combined with track brushes, or river brushes can allow him to suffer a lot of damage without taking in return. Pantheon has great potential of choice with his R and W. In the middle of the match, he can get a lot of choice with his team."}
{"text": "As sett, Can be kited to oblivion, especially when he is against a ranged carry with some form or dash or peel.\n\nMisuse of his W can get him killed as it is his only form of damage mitigation. He can\u2019t escape easily if someone all-ins him after he uses this ability.\n\nIf the enemy is smart, they will avoid grouping up during fights. This will prevent Sett from using his Ultimate R effectively, as he won\u2019t be able to land a lot of damage or slow multiple members of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As trundle, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, At level 9, Jarvan will get his first maximum ability. This will give him a massive increase in damage, impacting the fights at a much higher level. Once Jarvan reaches level 11, he will put two points in his Ultimate m. This will increase the damage of this ability while simultaneously reducing his cooldown. This will allow Jarvan to look for peaks more often. Jarvan IV is good in the team fights due to his d Passive and his ability to CC several enemies to go with his d > e combo. Its Ultimate m will also allow him to distinguish the enemies that need to be dealt with quickly."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Split push and draw aggro while your team applies pressure elsewhere on the map.\n\nIn team fights, use your empowered E to get picks to start the fight. Catching someone out and subsequently getting a kill could provide your team with enough time to take the Baron or Dragon.\n\nPeel for your team in team fights. Use your Q on the nearest champion to protect yourself and your ADC."}
{"text": "As ryze, Ryze is excellent at the end of the game as he can completely resume the game with his general damage combo and his passive. All he needs to do is be part of significant fights. Level sixteen is a decent peak when it comes to macro-based games. He can quickly jump from one goal to another, which can easily lead to victories for him. His release of damage will be really high during the later parts of the game. This will kill most of his enemies if they get CC'd by Ryze."}
{"text": "As belveth, Your goal in the early game is to win as much gold and Xp as quickly as you can. You want to prioritize inflation pathways with low mobility or for allies with the early CC as the strength of your basic capabilities at level 3 and 4 is quite important. Try and secure early goals that you can take them pretty quickly and if you kill them, you can transform into your True Form like using this to remove any nearby enemy."}
{"text": "Against zilean, Once Zilean is level 6, it will be harder for you to get kills in lane. Whenever his Ultimate t is down, try to abuse him to get kills. Communicate with your Jungler to abuse his Ultimate t cooldown.\n\nWhen looking to trade, try and bait out his Q before initiating a fight. This will make it impossible for him to CC you if the first Q misses. \n\nAfter Zilean has completed his first item, his wave clear will be pretty strong. Stand outside of the minion wave at all times so he is unable to push, poke and CC you at the same time."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus doesn't want to fight at the beginning of the game. Instead, he wants to focus on agriculture and stack his Q. Try to fight him when he's focused on stacking as he can focus on the farm rather than fighting you--which will allow you to gain a health advantage. Don't push Nasus under his turret because it allows him to grow safely. Instead of freezing the way to your side of the map, he has to extend for the farm. Once Nasus has a few levels behind him and has several points in his W, he'll have good gank set up. You'll need to play safer if the wave is closer to his side of the map during this period so that you don't die of ganks."}
{"text": "Against ashe, Ashe is really immobile and squishy. Try to catch her out of position at the start of the team fight so the enemy lacks consistent damage.\n \nKeep a constant eye on your champion's movements in the mid and late game as Ashe will usually throw out her Ultimate w \u201crecklessly\u201d in attempts to start the fight. Dodge it and then capitalise on the cooldown.\n \nBe prepared to back away from an objective if Ashe uses her k to scout vision. If your team is spotted, the enemy will try to contest the objective which may lead to your team throwing the game."}
{"text": "As swain, Excellent CC chain if he or someone else on his team manages to CC a target. This works especially well against immobile carries. You can follow up with your E (press it twice) and pull the enemy closer.\n\nCan regenerate a lot of health with his W and hence outsustain his enemies in the lane. His Ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective when fighting in closed spaces.\n\nHe can use his W to set-up ganks for his Jungler as well. This allows him to catch up to his target while also providing vision of the area. The latter part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "As azir, You're stronger than him at level 6. Your Ultimate is much stronger than his in 1v1s. Post 6, match his thrust power so he can't push you into your turn. Aim for your abilities so they grow and hit him at the same time. Try to harass him when he's in the minion wave. This will mainly be an agricultural confrontation. But, you can kill him and he can't really kill you. But he has a lot of poke."}
{"text": "As sylas, Sylas is strong enough during the middle of the game, especially if he gets a solid ultimate from the enemy team. His life flight will prevent him from dying quickly during important battles. Two points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take enemies' ultimates quickly and increase their overall efficiency. He can be very beneficial in team fights. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will give him a huge boost and allow him to blow up simple targets with ease."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven can easily 1v1 any champion at level 3 if she is in a favourable matchup. Do not overextend to reduce her chances of killing you.\n\nWhen Riven unlocks her Ultimate e, her all-in potential increases dramatically.  Make sure you disengage if she tries to fight you unless you have an advantage.\n\nOnce Riven has completed two or three items, she becomes very strong and will be able to take down any squishy champion that is not a tank. If you see her running towards you- just back away."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in its Ultimate R. As long as it can get the channel out, it will be very good in the late part. The teams will continue to group in the late part. This will allow the Fiddlesticks to get a good amount of damage to the entire enemy team. While you are good in the late part, you are incredibly squishy. Lookout and be careful trying to get a good Ultimate Roff so that you don't get killed before a fight breaks out."}
{"text": "As zac, As soon as the enemy advances or surpasses, he can look to play aggressively. His passive and ultimate R can allow him to take a group of enemies alone out of a large combat team by simply zoning them. He can also inflict a lot of damage to the enemy's rear line if they ignore Zac. Zac has good support in the way, thanks to his blobs. Additional health and maintenance allows him to survive more difficult matches and heal the enemy."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Play safely in the game early. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you'll have trouble in the line and you'll delay your first major power peak. Focus on electric farming and minimize trading up to your level 6. Once you unlock your Ultimate k, you can start to be more aggressive. Once you're level 6, you can look at playing more aggressive than you can use your Ultimate k as a trading tool and something to come back on."}
{"text": "As karma, Karma can do a lot of damage at the beginning of the game with her self-appointed Q. This will help get the enemy low for an all-in. Thanks to her Ultimate a, she can give her allies a huge buff shield that will protect them from incoming damage. He also gives a lot of speed of movement that will help her team disengage if necessary. Karma basically has 6 capabilities that offer her a ton of different counter-game. Depending on what she needs, she can use one of her self-sustaining abilities."}
{"text": "As brand, At level 11, Brand will put a second point in his Ultimate R. Its release of damage and will kill the pressure will increase sharply. As long as he plays around his Ultimate R, he should be a real threat during the middle of the game when it comes to getting ganks. During the middle of the game, Brand should have completed a few articles. In order to make the most of his kit, he should try to bring down the enemy before engaging in a team fight in order to increase his chances of winning the fight."}
{"text": "Against corki, After level 6, Corki will seek to constantly push the minion wave. Try to match its clear wave so that it does not keep you pushed in. If you do not, you will lose priority and turn plates. According to the champion you play, you may never be able to roll around the card and help your allies. As Corki has a great clear wave and pushing power, you can roam unless he is dead or otherwise he will take your turret down. Stand out of the minion wave or behind it. This will give him to choose between pushing or poking you. Do not stay in the minion wave because he will be able to push and poke with his b or e."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Stay mobile and keep a safe distance from Malzahar as much as possible to avoid being caught by its ultimate. Use your E capability to create a distance between you and Malzahar's cancellations if it tries to engage on you. Try to break the shield of Malzahar's fate before using your abilities, as it can deny many of your damage and crowd control effects. You can use your Q to do this just before a gank so that its shield is lowered and your Jungler can the CC quickly. Keep track of Malzahar's ultimate cooling and keep your distance from him when he is high. If an important ally is taken by her, use your Ultimate for CC him immediately. The wave must be kept in the middle of the way to prevent Malzahar from sitting in the oblivion in this matchup."}
{"text": "As zac, Look for regular all-ins with your W and E in this matchup. It will allow you to chunk immobile mages really easily and you can win the lane early on.\n\nWhen taking fights, make sure that you utilize the fog of war to catch the enemy off-guard. If the enemy has a dash, make sure that you bait it out first.\n\nAs long as your Passive is up, you should be able to make risky plays in this matchup. Make sure that you don't do anything that places you in a compromising position in the lane.        "}
{"text": "As lulu, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven can easily 1v1 any champion at level 3 if she is in a favourable matchup.

Make sure you disengage if she tries to fight you unless you have an advantage.\n\nOnce Riven has completed two or three items, she becomes very strong and will be able to take down any squishy champion that is not a tank. If you see her running towards you- just back away."}
{"text": "Against rell, When playing as a ranged champion, try your hardest to bully Rell down whenever she walks forward. If you can keep her low, she will be unable to engage or play aggressively.\n\nWhenever she is dismounted W, you should look to play aggressive and poke her down. She is very vulnerable and has nothing to stop you from doing it.\n\nOnce Rell hits level 6, her Ultimate R is a very versatile tool that can allow her to turn around exchanges. Under no circumstances should you try to dive her post 6."}
{"text": "Against ivern, Prevent Ivern from getting 3 buffs from going back and forth by watching the two river bushes at 1:25. This should give you enough time to the vertical jungle. Ivern is rather weak in the beginning of the game. If you play a strong first game champion, try to invade him to put him behind. Ivern has good Dragon control thanks to Daisy R, but he can also do it after havingganking bot. Make sure you keep the vision on the Dragon at any time to spot him while he's on it."}
{"text": "Against ivern, While not strictly a power spike, if Ivern has the opportunity to steal your level 1 buff, you will fall behind early. Prevent this by placing wards in the river at 1:25.\n \nOnce Ivern hits level 6, he will unlock Daisy R. This increases his gank ability and potency on the map. Try to delay his power spike by stealing away his camps and counter ganking when necessary. \n \nIvern usually hits his power spikes between 11 mins and 20 mins when he hits his 2 item power spike (Redemption and Ardent). Always take his Redemption in consideration when trying to kill the enemy."}
{"text": "As graves, Fighting near terrain is his bread and butter due to how his l works. It can help him deal a lot of burst damage in a very short duration, and combined with his Passive, he can blow up any squishy target with ease.\n\nHis e allows him to dodge important skillshots and allows him to re-position quickly if he happens to misstep. It also allows him to avoid bad situations as he can use it to get over terrain and disengage with ease.\n\nThe e near-sightedness can cause mayhem for an enemy team, especially if they are clumped up together. This ability can prevent the enemy ADC from picking a target to focus on while Graves keeps pelting them with his auto-attacks."}
{"text": "As morgana, Morgana can start crashing after reaching level 3. However, the most levels under her belt best. At level 6, Morgana will unlock her Ultimate R. This in conjunction with her Q or Allied CC will make it very easy for her and her team to get choices and kill."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Very immobile which can make him a prime target for engage champions. Once engaged upon, he can do nothing unless he gets some help from his teammates.\n\nOnce his e is down, he will be useless unless he has some sort of item or numbers advantage. His e forms the core of his entire kit so if the enemy waits it out, he won\u2019t be as effective.\n\nWhen going for the AD build, his Ultimate y is next to useless in terms of both utility and damage. It also costs a high amount of mana which is really bad for Kog\u2019Maw."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Your goal is to hide in the fog of war during team fights and then get a massive team-wide CC on the enemy team. Fighting around chokepoints should be very fruitful for you.\n\nRoam around when possible as your Ultimate R, E, and Q should make up for some easy ganks during this phase of the game. Work with your Jungler to invade the enemy Jungle and secure picks. \n\nWork with your Jungler and set up death brushes whenever you can. This will help you a lot in this game as your Q Active is really overpowered when bursting people down."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid pushing the wave as much as you can, because Yasuo has an incredibly strong all-in-one and can bring you down if you push. Try to keep the wave closer to your side of the map in the laning phase so that it can't chase you and kill you. Be careful around the minion wave as Yasuo will often use its E to pass through the minion wave to reach you. Stay outside and away from the minion wave at all times. Try to space accordingly at Yasuo and its Support. If the Support has CC, try to play as far as possible. This will make it difficult for them to reach you."}
{"text": "As swain, Very motionless and weak at the beginning of the laning phase. It is especially true if he is confronted with a champion who can all-in and CC him. Is quite vulnerable when his E is down as is his main form of CC. Painful injuries can completely counter his kit at the beginning of the game and also affect his playing environment. He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he has won."}
{"text": "As viktor, All of his abilities will be upgraded during this phase of the game, making him uber-powerful. His abilities will hit like a truck from now on.\n\nMultiple items will further let him deal more damage to enemies, especially those who clump up together during team fights.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate m will hurt the enemy team massively. Any kind of fight around chokepoints will automatically make Viktor the winner."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven will try to divide the thrust when there is no team fight. Make sure that someone who can challenge it is sent to prevent it from pushing. Avoid fighting it in the middle of the game, but unless you are stronger. Teamfighters will be difficult for Riven because it is subject to CC, disengagement and gets kitted by the champions easily. To make the team fight easier, she will probably flanculate or Flash to engage."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn cannot team fight easily. She will try to flank from the side with her Ultimate R and get on to a carry. Ward your flanks to make it harder for her to engage for free.\n\nIf Quinn can\u2019t team fight, she will stay in a side lane and try to split push. You can either send someone who has TP to prevent her from taking side towers, or you can quickly engage on to the enemy team and start a fight. Do not delay a team fight as it will give Quinn time to take an objective or rotate to join her team.\n\nQuinn\u2019s pick potential is high. When sieging an objective, make sure nobody in your team is too far forward as she can pick them off with her E and start the fight."}
{"text": "As ezreal, As Ezreal will be poking a lot in lane, when your Spell Shield E is down, ensure you stand behind your minions so he cannot land poke on you.\n\nUse your skills lavishly in lane to clear minions and hard push into the enemies Turret. Ezreal has little in terms of gank potential, so if you can- push the lane.\n\nOnce the enemy hits level 6, their kill pressure in lane increases heavily. Keep this in mind and respect their all in damage. \n\nKeep your R to chase Ezreal down once he uses Arcane Shift E to escape from a gank. Your R will help you and your allies get on to Ezreal with no problems. If possible, bait this ability out with Q beforehand so you do not have to use your R."}
{"text": "As trundle, Peeling for your carries in the late-game team fights is essential to increase your team's chances of winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus on the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive. Make sure you h them in time and get enemies off your carries regularly. \n\nUse the fog of war and secure as many picks as you can during this game phase. Don't have tunnel vision on the enemy, though, else you will just get collapsed on."}
{"text": "As alistar, Alistar has limited range. With good enemy positioning, it can be incredibly difficult for him to engage.\n\nUnfortunately, Alistar relies on his team more than some other Supports. Before engaging with his t>e combo, he needs to make sure his team is nearby and ready to follow up.\n\nOnce he\u2019s gone in, it\u2019s difficult for Alistar to escape unless he has Flash. Even with his tanky stats, he is vulnerable in a team fight."}
{"text": "As ashe, Ashe will secure many peaks during this phase of the game, thanks to all her slows and CC in her kit. She will have to work closely with her Jungler while making sure that she positions herself properly during the fighting. Thanks to her basic elements, Ashe will be able to duel fairly effectively now. Using her slow y and Ultimate w, she should try to keep the enemy at hand while she continues to peel them with her attacks. The use of her k will be quite vital as she will easily be able to spot around neutral and objective pits before a meaningful fight. This will prevent her from getting unnecessary dead while she sets up the vision."}
{"text": "As nasus, Later the game goes, the stronger Nasus will be. The more piles he has on his Q, the stronger he will be. At level 16, Nasus will put the final point in his Ultimate R. The additional statistics he gets from this ability will be incredibly useful in team fights and he will remain alive for a long period of time. His main peak of power is during this phase of the game, as he will have several articles, several piles, and will be able to openly select all enemy champions at his will."}
{"text": "Against renata, She\u2019s not very strong in the early game and can be made weaker by poking her down and constantly watching your positioning.\n\nAt level 6, you\u2019ll need to play a little more respectful as she can set up picks and her Jungler with her Ultimate R.\n\nIf she uses her W on her ADC, wait for the spell to wear off before committing to a hard fight. It has a very long cooldown and she can be abused while it\u2019s on cooldown.\n"}
{"text": "As nasus, Your champion is weak in the early game. Avoid fighting until you have quite a few levels behind you. Once you have an item and some levels under your belt, you can look for skirmishes with the enemy.\n\nFocus on farming and picking up as much farm as possible in the early game. This will make you more of a threat in the later parts of the game.\n\nRotate and move around the map if your bot lane decides to rotate to the top lane after securing the bottom lane tower."}
{"text": "As sion, Avoid lane brushes as much as possible if you don't have vision of them and Sion is missing from the lane.\n\nKeeping your resource bar half filled should help you significantly in this matchup, especially if Sion decides to all-in you.\n\nSion may try to lane gank your allies. If such a thing happens, just look to push and take as many plates as possible.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}

Always CC the enemy target before going in for a trade to ensure that no one can turn on you.\n\nGetting your Ultimate R is a massive power spike in the lane and one which will let you take over the game with ease. Don't hesitate to use the ability on low-health enemy champions, even if it means stealing a kill.        "}
{"text": "Against nocturne, In the middle of the game, avoid separating yourself by staying in the team. Nocturne has great selection potential and will try to kill squishy champions who are on their own thanks to his Ultimate a. Every time Nocturne is divided by pushing across the map, he has no way to get to his team quickly. If you see it elsewhere, look to engage and start a team fight. Nocturne will try to reduce the most squischi high priority target at the beginning of the fight. It's usually the Mid or ADC. Clump together in team fights to reduce its potential at once."}
{"text": "Against akshan, Akshan\u2019s first power spike is when he unlocks all 3 basic abilities. Although, his early game damage is pretty good at level 1 and 2.\n\nWhen he unlocks his Ultimate at level 6, his kill pressure intensifies. Keep this in mind and avoid staying in lane when low.\n\nAfter Akshan\u2019s first back, he should\u2019ve picked up a component item for his Mythic. Unless you\u2019ve matched him, be careful as he will win trades and all-ins."}
{"text": "As twitch, At level 14, Twitch will have two of its maximum capabilities. This means that it will do tons of damage and decimate its opposition if they are grouped. Twitch will now have several articles, which means that its release of damage will be really high. The real damage aspect of its Passive will help it a lot while dealing with tanks."}
{"text": "Against teemo, If you can keep it pushed in, you might be able to get things done elsewhere on the map. It will be difficult for you to get ganks in this matchup. Don. Don't expect your Jungler gank unless you've cleaned the Shrooms t of the way. Try and don't choose a melee champion in him. You'll find more success with a varied champion instead."}
{"text": "Against graves, The automatic attacks of Graves are not always effective because monsters/minions/turns block its damage and consume a bullet. Stay behind a monster or minion to avoid its automatic attack damage. When you fight around the Scuttle Crab, make sure it is between you and him to block a car. When it duelle Graves, try to get away from the terrain as he will use it to his advantage to blow up his l faster. Graves is a very strong duel. Do not fight it unless it is weak in health and low in ammunition. It is also very good at kiting as well."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn's Q is a potent tool in the lane. It can completely negate the ability to auto-attack from one or multiple enemies.\n\nGaining her E is a significant power spike in the lane. This ability makes her very slippery and a menace to deal with.\n\nGetting her Ultimate R unlocks Quinn's roaming potential. She can now go for a 'hit and run' kind of playstyle and gank other lanes when required.\n"}
{"text": "As gragas, Make sure that the objective neutral pit is out of bounds for the enemy Jungler during the fighting. It will help your Jungler secure the lens quickly and without any risk of running out of smit. Always respond faster than the enemy Support when the fighting breaks out in the river. With your kit, you should have a fairly easy time while out and disrupt the escape of enemies. Roaming will help you a lot, especially when your ADC is not on track. Use your E, Q, and Ultimate R to completely cut an enemy sled away during roaming."}
{"text": "Against sona, Before level 6, try to abuse it as much as possible. Once it is level 6, its death pressure increases as its Ultimate R is an excellent duel tool and has a great gank set up as well. The best time to play aggressively is when Sona superextenses to get batteries on her Spellthief. When she's overextended, try to play aggressive and explode when she positions herself forward."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 9, Ezreal maximizes his Q. He will be strong enough at this stage of the game thanks to the additional damage his Q will make and the items he would have picked up by then. Putting the second point in Ezreal, Ultimate R at level 11 will offer him a lot of additional damage. He will also be able to threaten the flights on major goals like Baron or Dragons. Ezreal is really good to bring down enemies before a fight thanks to its low temperature reductions and overall damage."}
{"text": "As veigar, He can easily start pulling people once he manages to get his first element. Extremely powerful when he fights in closed spaces as he can easily land his e and r on several targets while the crowd controlling them with his n. Very high potential to set up gank with his n. This can allow him to call his Jungler to gank his way and help him get an early lead, which will be pretty devastating for the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against zilean, At level 6, Zilean\u2019s kill pressure doesn\u2019t exactly increase, but his survivability does. Whenever he uses his Ultimate t, try to abuse the cooldown and play aggressive while it\u2019s down.\n\nOnce Zilean has completed his first item and once he has enough levels behind him, he will be able to one-shot the minion wave and push incredibly fast. Stand outside of the minion wave at all times so he is unable to poke and push at the same time.\n\nDo not disrespect Zilean\u2019s Bombs Q damage in the mid and late game. He can deal a surprising amount of burst damage if he is able to get a catch."}
{"text": "As akali, Both your E and Ultimate offer tons of outplay potential. You can often escape ganks or turn them around easily if you\u2019re able to play it slow and wait for the perfect opportunity to fight or escape. \n\nSquishy champions will often be left alone, or they will walk around the map unaided. You can use this to your advantage to snowball and get more kills as Akali is a strong assassin and can kill squishy champions easily. \n\nIf you\u2019re able to get a few kills in lane, you can snowball quite quickly and further your lead. Try to abuse any slight advantage you get to increase your chances of winning the game.\n"}
{"text": "Against gangplank, Gangplank will always be stronger if he has a Barrel E placed under him. Keep this in mind and try to fight him when there is none. At level 6, ping that Gangplank has his Ultimate R key. It=s that your team knows that he can use his Ultimate R to impact a fight. Gangplank is rather weak in early play and needs time to come online. Try and abuse his weak early game to move forward."}
{"text": "As ryze, Bait out abilities before looking to engage in a fight.\n\nConsider getting armor pen as Ryze tends to buy armor items.\n\nExtended trades will work in your favor, prioritize them over short ones.\n\nCare for his range and auto attacks to avoid unnecessary damage."}
{"text": "As corki, At level 13, Corki will max his second ability which is usually his n. This is a very powerful spike for Corki as it will allow him to shred through tanks in late game team fights.\n\nAt level 16, Corki will put the third and final point in his Ultimate e. As teams will be grouping at this stage of the game, he will be able to poke them down a lot before initiating a fight.\n\nCorki is very good in the late game as long as he is not behind. Try and avoid falling behind in the early game to make you an overwhelming force to be reckoned with in the late game."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong's level 3 is quite strong. Once he has all his basic abilities, he can look for a favorable trade. Once Wukong's level 6 is hit, his death pressure increases considerably. Expecting that he is looking for murders once his Ultimate n is up. Wukong is strong in the mid-game team fights thanks to the AOE strike on his Ultimate n. Expect that he is looking for fighting by attacking on the side."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks wants to poke and stay safe in the very early game. He is not very strong, so his job is to survive early.\n\nFiddlesticks first power spike is when he reaches level 6. Unlocking his Ultimate R offers him extra kill pressure in lane and will allow him to start looking for aggressive plays.\n\nAfter Fiddlesticks has completed his first component item, he will be a little stronger and can start to trade more aggressively with the enemy. "}
{"text": "As kled, Kled is really good early on as he can use his Q and E to all-in and destroy his enemy in trades. His W plays a pivotal role in it as well.\n\nOnce Kled hits level 6, he will gain access to his Ultimate R, which will allow him to all-in laners in different lanes. He can even pay a surprise visit to the bot lane.\n\nThe first item component will increase Kled's dueling potential. It will make him more powerful than he already is, which is terrible news for the enemy.        "}
{"text": "Against zilean, Once Zilean is level 6, it will be harder for you to get murders in the way. Every time his Ultimate t is down, try to abuse it to get murders. Contact your Jungler to abuse his Ultimate t cooldown. When you're looking to trade, try and lure his Q before you start a fight. This will make it impossible for him to get you CC if the first Q is missing."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Ziggs\u2019 main poke tool in lane is his Bouncing Bomb Q. This skill has a short cooldown and does a decent amount of AOE damage. Do not stand in the minion wave to avoid taking free damage.\n\nLook for extended auto-attack trades with Ziggs\u2019 after he has used his empowered auto-attack. As he is an AP champion, he doesn\u2019t do well when trading autos.\n\nZigg\u2019s will be looking to constantly poke and push the minion wave so he can get an early tower with his W. Try to match his wave clear so he is unable to push you into Tower and take it easily."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lisandra has to commit to an all-in in order to make use of her kit. This can be a problem if her team is not on the same page as her. Her Ultimate R is more of a utility tool than a harmful tool. This can be a problem against the stronger midway champions. If you're behind, you're going to do no harm in team fights and your poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "As ekko, Ekko is a strong early game Jungler. Use this to your advantage by looking to gank as often as you can in the early game. You can start ganking once you have your E and your W.\n\nWhile you\u2019re a strong Jungler, you need to find a healthy balance between farming and ganking. Gold is incredibly important for Ekko and if he falls behind, he will struggle to get back into the game.\n\nEkko has good objective control. Try to secure every objective if possible either alone or with your team to gain a lead over the enemy."}
{"text": "As ezreal, The sooner you get it, the better. Harass and poke the enemy as often as you can with your Q. Slowly whipping the enemy with your Q will increase your chances of winning a follow-up fight. Back early once you have enough gold for your first item. Usually Ezreal will want to remember once he has enough gold for Tear."}
{"text": "As senna, Really effective long ranged poke and Passive procurement agency. Her poke also allows her to heal up with her Q, so she is really good against poke.\n\nHer W can allow her to CC an entire group of enemies with utmost ease. This ability becomes very powerful when she is fighting in closed spaces.\n\nHer E can allow her to sneak an entire team through non-warded area and surprise an enemy team. This can be beneficial while setting up death brushes."}
{"text": "As zyra, Zyra has good wave clear and can poke the enemy at the same time with her Q. This is great use of her mana pool.\n\nShe can turn a gank around as long as she has seeds placed down before the enemy initiates. When they go in, she can spawn some plants and potentially turn around the exchange.\n\nZyra has great burst potential and can easily blow up any squishy target as the game goes along."}
{"text": "As karthus, You will be able to blow up squishies with your Ultimate e with ease now. Even if they don't die, they will be too chunked to participate in a team fight.\n\nYou will be able to burn through the entire enemy team with proper positioning. Your 1 combined with your n will be able to one-shot enemy squishies. Use this strategy during neutral, objective fights.\n\nRemember that your n placement can make or break an entire team fight. Place it well and from the fog of war so that the enemy team doesn't anticipate it and take necessary precautions beforehand."}
{"text": "As sion, Can soak a lot of damage for his team as a front line. This allows him to peel for his carries with ease, which can allow his carries to play more freely.\n\nHis Ultimate R can be used to set up ganks on other lanes. No one suspects a Sion to ult from base and down to the bottom or middle lane.\n\nHis E is a very easy skill to land which guarantees a Q from Sion\u2019s end. This can be of great value for setting up ganks for his Jungler."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. Tryndamere has lots of kill pressure and if you push, he could easily all-in you and chase you down the lane.\n\nLook for fights when he has little Fury in his resource bar. The more Fury he has, the stronger he will be.\n\nWhenever his Ultimate e is down, try to abuse the cooldown and look for kills. Once his Ultimate e is up, his kill pressure and survivability increases a lot."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Its poke damage is quite high and heinous for the enemy team to manage. This poke can accumulate over time and makes it so that the enemy lantern is forced to play in the cover of their minion wave. Its potential to clear the waves is very high due to its W and Q. This allows it to clear the waves quite quickly and get the priority of the track, which allows it to help his team to secure the objectives. Excels in the fighting taking place in bottlenecks and close quarters because it allows it to quickly stack its Passive. This combined with its Ultimate R can easily allow it to destroy the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, When sitting on a goal, be sure to keep around the target in question to catch Fiddlesticks before he engages with his R. Deny his surprise engages by guiding around your team. Look for the fights when Fiddlestick=S R is about to cool down because with it his team fighting potential decreases a lot. Do not gather closely together during the dance with the enemy."}
{"text": "As taric, Focus on safe play and keep your ADC alive as long as possible in the way. Your early play is weak and you need time to come online. As you are a melee support, monitor your positioning at all times so that you are not harassed by the enemy Support if they are understood."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, At level 16, Aurelion will put the third and final point in its Ultimate. It should be able to do a lot of damage in team fighting at this stage of the game. In the late part, Aurelion Sol will be able to flatten a lot of damage as it should be close to completing its construction. Make sure you play effectively around your Ultimate and E to stay alive. At level 13, Aurelion would have maximized its first two abilities. It should be a real competitor to start team fighting with its Q."}
{"text": "As khazix, Flank in team fights to get on key targets with your E. Avoid showing yourself when possible in the late game as the element of surprise can provide a huge advantage.\n\nWhen ahead, look for picks by waiting in high traffic areas for an enemy to walk by. If you\u2019re able to take down the enemy Mid, ADC or Support, you can use their death timer to end the game or take a major objective.\n\nAvoid dying and remain on the same side of the map as the next major objective. Do not show on the bottom side of the map if Baron is about to come up."}
{"text": "As lucian, Avoid all-ins on Lucian during the early game as he is sure to decimate you in this matchup. Also, while laning, make sure that you are not alingned with minions.\n\nRemember that Lucian can counter your mobility easily. That being said, you have 2 dashes, so use it well.\n\nHe falls off as the game continues, and so do you. Be careful, and try to end the game by 30 mins else you will have a lot of issue.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and see if you can expose him to ganks. Shutting him down early is key to winning the game."}
{"text": "As morgana, Really good waveclear with her W. This can allow her to shove the wave really quickly and then help her Jungler on different occasions.\n\nHer Q helps her with gank set-ups, and picks during the mid-game. The root duration can easily allow her to hide in a Jungle brush and wait for her target to wander into her Q range.\n\nThe E can allow her to make one of her carries or herself invincible to CC for a while. This is really beneficial during team fights, or when laning against heavy CC."}
{"text": "Against talon, Talon is incredibly strong at level 2 and 3. Look at your positioning so you don't die at an all-in-one early. Once Talon is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his death pressure increases considerably. You have to play more respectful at this time and avoid engaging in prolonged fighting. If Talon Get Mobi Boots, his roaming pressure increases. As soon as he disappears, ping that he's gone and push the wave"}
{"text": "As leblanc, LeBlanc should never be involved in direct team fights unless she is completely pushed into the enemy base. Staying in the fog of war is highly beneficial for her.\n\nLooking for picks on the enemy Jungler, Support, or ADC should be her game plan. Taking one of these targets out will easily allow her team to secure neutral objectives.\n\nIf the enemy team is CC laden, Leblanc will have to preserve her power by purchasing a Zhonya's Hourglass or Banshee's Veil. She is a glass cannon and should always be careful about going in."}
{"text": "As ashe, Stand behind minions to block her damage.\n\nUnfortunately, their level 6 is stronger than yours, so be careful when fighting post 6.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your side of the map in the very early game.

{"text": "As kayn, If they invade you early, right back. This is especially true if they are early, because you won't win early fights with them Be proactive with your Ultimate, because they will seek to use theirs every time it's up. Force ganks with your R! As they will often gaunt in early play, you need to make sure that you also look at gank as often as you can and abuse your E. Focus on securing these goals. You need to take Rift Heralds and Drakes when you can!"}
{"text": "As varus, Varus\u2019 Q poke during the laning phase is pretty strong. If he aims his Q on the minion wave and the enemy at the same time, he will make great use of his mana.\n\nAt level 6, Varus can setup his Jungler with his Ultimate R. A good Varus will look to poke the enemy down and then get their Jungler to gank to shut down the enemy Mid laner.\n\nVarus' first item is going to give him a huge power spike. This simply means that his burst damage combo will do a lot of damage and can completely destroy any immobile or CC\u2019d enemy champion.\n"}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin will have multiple items during this phase of the game. It will allow him to deal robust amounts of damage while ensuring that his survivability is preserved.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This means that he will be dishing out a heavy amount of burst damage and ultimately killing squishy enemies off by himself.\n\nAt level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate k. This will let him use that ability wholly and frequently ruin the ability of enemy divers to get into his backline.        "}
{"text": "Against naafiri, Ward the river to reduce her ability to get early ganks off.\n\nIf you see her ganking someone on your team, invade the opposite side of her jungle to take away camps and deny her XP.\n\nShe can easily secure objectives like the Drake or Rift Herald thanks to her Packmates. Ensure they\u2019re warded whenever they\u2019re up so she cant take them for free.\n"}
{"text": "As rell, Stay together with your team. Do not leave your ADC side, otherwise the enemy will capitalize on the fact that you are not there to protect your ADC. Peel for your carts in the team fights. After using your R, step back and protect your allies and focus the closest champion. Look for choices with your R Ultimate. If you can catch someone when the enemy is not organized, you can force a team fight or a goal afterwards."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Forcing a fight or fighting when Swain isn\u2019t around will make it easier for your team to win team fights.\n\nAvoid grouping too closely around objectives or in team fights as it may allow Swain to land a really good multi-person E and start the team fight.\n\nBurst and poke is the best way of winning a fight against Swain. Try to poke him down before a team fight starts. When he activates his Ultimate R, burst him down so he is unable to dish out lots of damage."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia\u2019s first significant power spike is when she hits level 3. While she can dish out a lot of damage at levels 1 and 2, she becomes much stronger when she has access to her basic abilities.\n\nThe next major power spike for Cassiopeia\u2019s is when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Her Ultimate R is very versatile and can be used to either engage or disengage from a fight. It can also be used to set up her Jungler.\n\nCassiopeia\u2019s will start to do a lot more damage in trades when they\u2019ve picked up their first item. Landing one Q and then following that up with multiple E\u2019s should give you a severe health advantage."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ezreal's first power peak is when he takes Sheen. His Q damage will increase considerably and he will look to poke constantly. Once Ezreal has finished his Manamune and upgraded it to Muramana, his damage output and maintain will be much higher. Every time Ezreal has his E, it is much safer and harder to kill. Try to abuse cooldown whenever you can."}
{"text": "As yuumi, During the laning phase, focus on poking the enemy down to gain a health advantage. When the enemy is low, commit to an all-in.\n\nTry your hardest to keep your ADC alive for as long as possible in lane. Provide them with heals E whenever they need them.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As aphelios, Aphelios is good in mid-game team fights thanks to the potential of his Ultimate R and the mix of his weapons. As long as he didn\u2019t fall behind in the early game, his mid-game will be where he truly shines.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Aphelios should\u2019ve completed multiple items. He will start to dish out a lot of damage, and he will find it much easier to take down the enemy frontline.\n\nAphelios is a good mid-game champion, especially when paired with a utility Support or a team that can empower him. Healing and shielding, or hard engage Supports will definitely help him shine in the mid-game."}
{"text": "As shen, His first game ganks are quite solid because he can push CC targets with ease. That being said, the allied ganking with hard CC is always preferable for Shen. Level 6 is a massive power peak for Shen. It is also a free gank/roam ticket for him because he can immediately show up to a track and catch the out-of-guard enemy. The first element will allow him to inflict more damage and strengthen his overall survival. He will also allow him to clean his camps quickly."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand\u2019s first power spike is once he hits level 3. While he will have poke up until that stage, it isn\u2019t enough to fully proc his Passive.\n\nBrand\u2019s second power spike is once he unlocks his Ultimate R. It will offer him a lot of additional damage and he should be able to blow up the enemy Mid laner if he has been able to land some poke down beforehand.\n\nOnce Brand has completed his Mythic item, he can constantly keep the enemy Mid laner pushed into their tower. His damage will also heavily increase once he has picked this item up."}
{"text": "As galio, Keep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them after they\u2019ve used an ability as they cannot use it to trade back with. Galio is less of a threat when they have an ability down.\n\nThink twice before using your dash in this matchup. If you dash forward, they could all-in you, or the enemy Jungle could show up. Look at whats happening on the map before dashing forward.\n\nMake sure you hit level 2 before Galio so you can abuse your level 2 all-in to get an early lead.\n\nPost 6, your Ultimate offers you a ton of additional kill pressure and opportunities to get kills. Abuse this by playing around its cooldown and trying to make plays whenever it is up."}
{"text": "As quinn, Keep poking the enemy with your Q as much as you can. Use the lane brushes occasionally to ensure that the enemy is forced to stay away from the brushes and the minion wave.\n\nYour E must be used very carefully in this matchup as the enemy can easily use their Flash to put you in a compromising position mid-E. Staying parallel to your Support is the way to go.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you will be able to make sure that you can roam around and pick kills all around the map. This will make you a nuisance for the enemy team.        "}
{"text": "Against malphite, Malphite is at its weakest in the early game. Try to put it behind to delay its next power peak. Once Malphite is level 6 and has its Ultimate h, its threat of death in the way increases and it can start to be more aggressive. Team fights are where Malphite really shines like its Ultimate h is an AOE ability and can hit several people."}
{"text": "As rengar, Rengar will begin to fall as the game continues, so he will have to accumulate an early lead on. He should rely on peaks to win the game. He will have a lot of articles during this phase of the game, which will allow him to flatten a lot of damage if he manages to catch an enemy. Level 16 is a massive peak of power, which means that he can completely decimate enemies who are isolated. He will frequently have to find sides on the enemy to make sure that he can take the game and win quickly."}
{"text": "As anivia, Up until level 6, look to play safe and farm as much as you can. Once you\u2019ve got enough gold for Tear, recall so you can start stacking the item.\n\nAs soon as you hit level 6, use your Ultimate m on the minion wave to keep it pushed into the enemies tower while remaining safe.\n\nKeep a constant eye on your mana bar regardless of how fast or slow you're pushing the wave.

{"text": "As lissandra, Lissandra's first item component will allow her to wave clear more efficiently. This is quite beneficial for her team as she can roam around a lot.\n\nLissandra will get a massive power spike at level 6 due to her ability to chain CC an enemy to oblivion. This is really useful when dealing with a fed or mobile carry.\n\nPutting multiple points in her Q will make her more powerful. It will let her wave clear quickly and allow her to deal a lot of damage to enemy groups.        "}
{"text": "Against qiyana, The Level 6 power peak for Qiyana is strong enough because it gives it a Ultimate R that changes the game that can be used in many ways. Be careful and not position near a tower or wall as it can look at R in you. Once Qiyana has its first element finished, she will seek to exchange more aggressively as she will have an additional cooling reduction and damage. Be careful and not go for short jobs as she favors them. Qiyana really shines in the middle of the game that her Ultimate R is an excellent team combat tool. Unlike many assassins, Qiyana actually favors team struggle."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Let him push the minion wave and capitalize on how immobile he is to force him to over extend. Then all-in him, or get your Jungler to gank him while he is over extended.\n\nLook to abuse his E and Q cooldowns as often as possible. He lacks damage without these abilities. Bait them out then abuse the cooldowns.\n\nWatch your positioning at all times so he cannot land those Es on you.\n"}
{"text": "As jax, Jax's o being maxed out at level nine is a superpower spike for him. He can take frequent fights and take little to no damage. In addition, the CC aspect will allow him to score many picks throughout the game.\n\nHis mid-game is not as weak as his early game because he will have his core items and can use his Passive pretty well. He will also be a part of many objective fights, allowing him to land a multi-man e stun on the enemies.\n\nOnce he gets two points in his Ultimate t, he will become mighty during team fights. This is because his survivability will increase, which will increase the amount of consistent damage dealt by him with his auto-attacks."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, Qiyana\u2019s team fight presence is huge. Spread out and do not fight in choke points like inside the jungle or under a Tower to reduce her usefulness. \n\nSplit pushing could be a good way to counter Qiyana\u2019s R, but ensure that the players who are facing her do not get caught out by her R as she will usually use it to start the team fight.\n\nBurst damage is one of the biggest problems Qiyana faces because she doesn\u2019t always buy defensive items. As soon as she uses her E aggressively, burst her down."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Xin is vulnerable to the CC during the team fights, don't ignore it. Focus on him when he engages. As he is a powerful champion of skirmishes, he will look for choices on enemies who walk around Rift Summoners alone. Avoid walking in areas that are not rewarded unless you know where Xin Zhao is. When Xin Zhaos Ultimate R is on cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable. Force Team fights when his Ultimate R is down to increase your chances of winning the fight."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Very still that can make him a primary target to hire the champions. Once engaged, he can do nothing unless he gets help from his teammates. Once his e is down, he will be useless unless he has some kind of element or number advantage. His e forms the core of his whole kit so that if the enemy waits for him, he won't be as effective."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Watch out for a potential Flash engage by Pantheon. In team fights, don\u2019t stand too far forward in case he tries to make a play.\n\nWard your flanks! Pantheon may try to attack you from the side and get on to your carries when his Ultimate R is on cooldown. \n\nGood times to fight is when Pantheon is split pushing. Forcing a fight when he is on the opposite side of the map could be a good idea as it will take him some time to get into the fight even with his Ultimate R. "}
{"text": "As jax, Its scale is unrivalled and it does really well in duels due to its e and e. The more the game goes, the more dangerous it becomes and can practically kill anyone regardless of the health they are. The e makes it take less damage from AoE abilities. This is really beneficial to him during the battles of full teams. Moreover, the e CC also acts as a really good initiation tool for his team. His Passive allows him to relentlessly divide the thrust. This can be extremely useful when the Jax-S team is behind and cannot win a fair team fight. His e allows him to escape attempts of collapse with ease."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cass is a monster at the end of the game. As long as she is not late, she will be incredibly strong in the end of the game. At level 13, Cass goes to max on her Q. By associating this with her max E, she will be able to do a lot of damage in a skirmish. At level 16, Cassiopeia will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will do a lot of damage, stun the enemy for a long period of time, be on a short cooldown and have the potential to win his team the game."}

She will still have to rely on using the terrain to E her opponents and then blow them up with her Q.\n\nOnce Zoe hits level thirteen, she will have increased pick potential due to her E being completely maxed out.

Her E is also a channel ability which can additionally be interrupted by Crowd control.\n\nIf Bel\u2019Veth doesn\u2019t get any take downs on champions or objectives in teamfights she can never activate her True Form which is when she becomes so much harder to deal with. \n"}

Make sure that Ornn can't pin you against terrain either.\n\nKeep poking him regularly in this matchup to hinder his all-in potential as much as you can.\n\nIf he has used his ult, and he is about to send the ram towards you, CC him immediately. His ult will go to waste this way.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}

This will reduce the ability's cooldown and will let him deal massive amounts of burst damage to the enemy.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level nine, which will give him a boost to his damage. It helps when it comes to dealing with ganks and all-ins.\n\nKassadin will be a monster if he is ahead on items or kills in this game phase. Otherwise, he won't be having a lot of impact on the game.        "}
{"text": "As evelynn, Get rid of the enemy CDA at the beginning of the fight, which will make the fight much safer for your team. Avoid getting too far away from your team. While Eve is a murderer and can get caught with her R, if she gets caught out of her position and too far from her team, the enemy will be able to kill you and take a goal. Look for choices in the late part. If you can get down someone, you can use the benefit of numbers to force a fight or a goal. The right time to look for a choice is when the enemy clears camps, side waves or wait for their allies to group."}

Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "As nunu, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the team fights at the end of the game. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without it will make the team fight a lot harder at the end of the game. Delaying the fights and being ready to disengage if it is still about to cool off. To make the enemy's attack easier, group with your team but stay away from the side. If you flank a bush not awarded, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid separating or being away from your team in the end of the game as the enemy will force a fight while you are gone."}
{"text": "Against shaco, If your team is grouped and you don't have a vision of Shaco, make sure you have a scan and vision goal around you, then you will be alerted if Shaco tries to jump and assassinate a port. Don't hunt Shaco as he could lure you to run in his Boxes x or to his team. Remember, Shaco Support is all about being a nuisance for the enemy. If you play as a hard engagement champion, ask yourself where Shaco was recently. If he was near the target you want to collapse on, he may have previously placed some Boxes x behind the target."}
{"text": "As brand, At level 9, Brand will put the final point in his W ability. This will allow him to constantly harass the enemy laner and get them low enough to where either they or their ADC can look for a kill.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Brand would\u2019ve picked up multiple items. His damage output and kill pressure will be incredibly high. Also, as teams start grouping in the mid-game, he will deal a lot of AOE damage.\n\nAt level 11, Brand will put a second point in his Ultimate R. This is a good power spike for Brand as he will be able to deal a considerable amount of burst damage and allow him to snowball further."}
{"text": "Against zed, Zed will start ganking as soon as he hits level 3.

Be careful when trying to initiate a skirmish with him as he might just pull out his magic card and kill you.\n \nJust like during the laning phase, you\u2019ll want to destroy Heimerdingers Turrets Q as quickly as you can before a team fight is underway so he is unable to dish out tons of damage."}
{"text": "As teemo, At level 6, Teemo can place tons of mushrooms t around the lane. This can help him prevent ganks from the enemy Jungler, and make it harder for the enemy bot lane from playing aggressive.\n\nTeemo is strong early and can bully the enemy down a ton. However, it depends heavily on the matchup and he must always position carefully so he doesn\u2019t take unnecessary damage.\n\nWhen he has completed his first component item, Teemo\u2019s poke and damage output in the lane will be a lot higher.\n"}
{"text": "Against reksai, The Rek-Sai-Sai kit allows it to have a creative gank through the walls; therefore, the possible Rek-Sai guard paths can gank through. It has a very good Dragon control in early play. Make sure you keep Drake monitored at any time so you can spot it before she is able to kill him alone. Rek-Sai can gank as soon as she reaches level 3 and has access to her E. Expect to get a gank early."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Consistent poke damage with his W and Q which can allow him to push the enemy laners out of the lane abruptly. This can also allow him to all-in enemies once they are low enough after taking the barrage of poke Ezreal has to offer.\n\nHis Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during the early game to waveclear. This is very helpful when he is trying to clear the wave quickly in order to get a recall.\n\nEzreal\u2019s E allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease and makes him one of the safest ADCs in the game. He can also buffer it in response to CC abilities which will allow him to avoid follow up CC if he manages to get hit by the initial CC ability."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm Kench can absorb a lot of incoming damage in the track and in team fighting with his E. If it activates it at the right time, it can basically have two health bars and be almost impossible to kill. Its Ultimate r is very versatile. It can be used to save an ally, or catch someone out of position. It is an excellent tool especially in the middle and the end of the game team fights His W is very versatile. It can be used to escape the skirmishes, get over the walls, look for parts and many other things."}
{"text": "As drmundo, At level 9, Dr. Mundo maximizes his E. His ability at 1v1 the enemy Jungler, or 1v1 any track champion, will be very high. Don't worry about the 1v1 champions if you're ahead. In the middle of the game, Dr. Mundo should have completed some basic elements. As every article he buys offers him defensive statistics, he will be very tanky throughout the middle of the game. He should be a giant threat in team fighting. At level 11, Dr. Mundo will put the second point in his Ultimate R. The additional regeneration of health combined with his overall tankesse will be very difficult to manage in the middle of the game. He will be incredibly tanky during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, His level 2 is quite an essential powerspike because he can now look for all-ins and knockup enemies with ease. Using the lane brushes for this purpose only amplifies the effect.\n\nLevel 6 is another significant power spike as it allows Jarvan to add another layer to his all-in combo. He can also separate someone out from their team and can easily pick targets off.\n\nJarvan is quite oppressive in the lane. His all-in threat is enough to keep enemies at bay, and keeping the lane brushes de-warded will let Jarvan catch the enemy off-guard with ease."}

It will really help you get more objectives due to how your Ultimate t works."}
{"text": "As jayce, Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressively and looking for aggressive parts. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. When you touch level 6, you have to play a little safer because you don't have an ultimate G, unlike all the other Top laners. Play respectfully and stay within maximum range while harassing the enemy from afar. Use your s to poke the enemy as often as possible. Use your base attacks in conjunction with this ability to get the low enemy."}

It will be tough to catch her.\n\nLevel six is a tremendous power spike as it allows Samira to impact and disrupt fights massively. It is also a decent finishing move, especially in clumped fights.\n\nHer first item component will increase her dueling potential significantly. Her ability to dish out damage in the lane will also skyrocket.        "}
{"text": "As jax, Jax is a strong ganker, and his ganks are easy to run. All he has to do is get close and use his e to CC the target. Jax skirmish power is excellent, and he can trade with or out of combat almost all the enemy Junglers. It is good for getting goals on his own. This allows him and his team to get an excellent objective advance for free."}
{"text": "Against jinx, Jinx doesn't have much help in the mobility department. If you or your team lands any crowd control on her, it should result in a kill. Try and lock her down as quickly as you can so she is unable to \u201cGet Excited!\u201d\n\nIn team fights, avoid grouping too close together as it will allow Jinx\u2019s Rockets Q to deal lots of AOE damage. It will also make her Ultimate R less effective if you\u2019re slightly split up.\n\nWhen taking objectives, make sure you\u2019re not low as Jinx may be able to take you down with a well-timed R. She can also steal objectives like the Dragon or Baron with her Ultimate R, so make sure you finish the objective off with Smite."}
{"text": "As rumble, Stay with your team during the middle of the game and continue to play with your Ultimate on enemies who are overstretched or alone. Make sure to invest in a magic pen during this stage of the game. The teams will be grouped, and you will need to help it with their defensive stats. Make the call for major goals like the Dragon after getting choices with your Ultimate."}
{"text": "As zeri, Zeri's first power peak is at level 3 when it unlocks each of its basic capabilities. It will be relatively strong at level 3. Its next power peak will usually be once it unlocks its first component element because it allows it to go for more favorable trades with the enemy lantern. At level 6, Zeri will unlock its Ultimate R. It is a good peak for Zeri and it will allow it to win all in even in the hardest matchups."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo will be boring to manage in the early game. Just be patient and look at your positioning. At level 6, Teemo is planting tons of mushrooms t around your way. Look at it at all times, and of course stay away from them. At level 11, Teemo will once again be peak because it will have access to more mushrooms t. At this stage of the game, it will also have them all around Summon Rift."}
{"text": "Against twitch, Twitch is a hyper carry and will become stronger and stronger as the game goes on. Ending the game quickly is often the wisest choice when playing against him.\n\nOnce he has access to his Ultimate c, his kill pressure increases. It\u2019s extended range and damage: in conjunction with his s, can be hard to deal with in lane.\n\nOnce Twitch has got Runaan's Hurricane, his damage output will be deadly. It is very important that you do not let him dish out his damage by bursting him down at the start of the fight."}
{"text": "As fizz, They are stronger than you early. Avoid fighting so you don't fall behind. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map so that you can protect yourself against their all-in. If they wander, ping and communicate with your team. You can't match their roams. Abuse your range in poking with your abilities. Try to self-attack when you can, but don't force it."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus is at his weakest in the game at first. Try to deny as many piles as possible so that he is unable to scale quickly. The more the game goes, the stronger Nasus gets. Make sure you finish the game as quickly as possible. Although he will focus on agriculture, once he has his Ultimate R, his death pressure will increase and his survival. Make sure you are not too cuckolded otherwise he can turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Expect Teemo to place Mushrooms t in the river and around the Scuttle Crab and your jungle entrances. Opt for a Sweeping Lens to reduce the chances of you walking into one. \n\nIf you spot Teemo on the top side of the map, try to invade the bottom side of his jungle to steal away his camps. This will make it really difficult for him to get gold and XP.\n\nHe has little control over the Dragon and cannot take it alone. If you\u2019re able to take it uncontested, you should do so. After all, he will just gank bot lane and take it with them if you don\u2019t get it beforehand."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Poke the enemy relentlessly in this lane and use the lane brushes frequently to proc your Q on them. Save your Q active to send the enemy scurrying away from you if they all-in you.\n\nMake sure that you set vision around the lane when possible. You may be a prime gank target before you hit level six, as you're pretty immobile.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, your team fight impact should increase massively. Use the effigies and bamboozle enemies with surprise Ultimate R's on them."}
{"text": "As nunu, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing up. Fighting with outside will make the fights of the late game team much harder. Delay fighting and be ready to disengage if it's still on cooldown."}
{"text": "As lillia, Your goal in the early game is to win the most gold and XP as quickly as you can. Power farm and gank the ways that are too wide to increase your gold income. Look to secure the goals as often as possible. This will give your team an advantage as the game unfolds. Your Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Every time it is up, try to use it to help your allies get murders."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas succeeds in reaching level 11, it will have two points in its Ultimate R. This means that it can initiate fighting and move key enemy targets much more frequently. At level 9, Gragas will have its first maximum ability. This is really beneficial for it because the increase in damage will really help it to duel. This is especially true if Gragas goes for full AP construction. During the middle of the game, the enemy will be busy exchanging tracks and defining the vision. However, as laner, it will use this ability to the maximum potential during the fight around landlocked areas and neutral objectives."}
{"text": "As gangplank, You will want to avoid getting stinged in this matchup. Be careful with the barrels in the brushes as well. Keep a close eye on its ultimate use. If it uses it in another way, you will have an easy time all-in-one. Short trades are usually a bad idea for you because of the way your kit works and your lack of mobility. Try to reach the enemy rear line when possible to cause chaos. Keep the wave somewhere in the middle of the track. It will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Level 6 is a massive power peak because it offers a lot of pressure because its Ultimate r does a lot of damage to enemies swallowed by it. Its W will allow it to exert a lot of pressure on the map as well. This means that it can try everything in the enemy on its own now. Level 3 is another important power peak as it gives it access to all its basic capabilities. This means that it can do much more in the track while using track brushes. Unfortunately, it will not be able to use its Passive quite well, however."}
{"text": "Against jhin, Be careful of when Jhin is running at you with his 4th shot during team fights. In the mid to late game, this auto can deal a lot of damage.\n\nWait for Jhin\u2019s team to engage or when he is isolated to try and pick him off. He doesn\u2019t have an escape or a dash, and he is very squishy too so he should be pretty easy to kill.\n\nIf Jhin uses his Ultimate R in a team fight, he is unable to reposition quickly. If you\u2019re on the flank, try to take him down while he\u2019s focusing on his shots. "}
{"text": "As morgana, His Q helps him with the gank configurations, and takes in the middle of the game. The length of the root can easily allow him to hide in a Jungle brush and wait for his target to walk in his Q range. The E can allow him to make one of his invincible portages at CC for a while. It's really beneficial during team fighting, or during heavy CC laning."}
{"text": "As viktor, If your allies move on your track after destroying their turn, rotate and move around the map to continue growing and winning XP and gold. Use your capabilities to quickly clear the minion waves so your team can besiege/prevent an enemy team seat. If you can land poke while also pushing the minion wave, you can look for a favorable trade. By sitting Baron or Dragon, or whenever you push the enemy under their turn, look for a peak with your abilities. If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you will be able to take the goal for free."}
{"text": "Against nunu, When it comes to securing an objective like the Dragon or Baron, never go for the 50/50. Because of Nunu\u2019s Q, he will win every battle. Try to take the objective when he is dead or on the other side of the map.\n\nNunu is rather immobile when it comes to team fighting (once the fight has started). Lock him down with crowd control and kite him during the team fight so he is unable to be the frontline and get on to your carries.\n\nDo not clump together when it comes to team fighting. If you stand close to one another, he will use his Snowball W to engage from afar and run into the enemy. If you are all close to one another- he might be able to get a 5 person knock up. Instead, group but not too closely."}
{"text": "As yone, Use your E on Yone after he uses his charged Q or E. This is because he will evade your ability otherwise, and you won't kill him.\n\nYour Qcan easily let you interrupt Yone multiple times when he is trying to all-in you. Use it properly to ensure that he can't auto-attack you a lot of times during a fight.\n\nPlay a bit safer in the lane, and don't let him hit you with his W frequently. This damage will build up and will allow Yone to all-in you later.\n\nYour Ultimate is exceptionally potent, so make sure you use it during major team fights. The enemy backline is your target, especially if there is an immobile target there. \n"}
{"text": "As lillia, The CC'ing is of paramount importance. Use your Q to knock it out when possible. Once it is CC'd, beat it. Pay attention to the reduction of early healing of its end in this matchup. Do not do it can allow Lillia to surpass you. Lillia will tend to you and your allies at a distance and then ult and go to kill it. You can use your Flash, or the fog of war to go for the enemy team in such a case. In this way, your team can deal with Lillia as they wake up while you can use your abilities to land the enemies. Keep the wave near your turn and focus on agriculture. Remember to stay away from the ground as it can let her splash her E."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen will have three points in his Ultimate R at level 16, which will give him a massive damage boost and the luxury to use the ability frequently. Of course, it helps a lot when he manages to catch an enemy off-guard.\n\nHis tankiness is overpowered during the late game due to all his items. However, he won't be dying a lot and can easily zone out the enemy from his team, especially if the enemy team has an assassin who likes to dive the allied backline.\n\nGaren will have many items now, which will give him both a damage and survivability boost in the lane. He can tank tower shots for days and allow his team to tower, dive enemies as and when required."}
{"text": "As aatrox, When your team isn\u2019t looking to fight, split push and apply pressure elsewhere on the map.\n\nAvoid team fighting during the mid-game unless you have your Ultimate R up. When it\u2019s on cooldown, you\u2019ll miss out on a lot of sustain and damage, so it\u2019s vital that you play around this abilities cooldown.\n\nIn mid-game team fights, look for picks by flanking the enemy backline. If you\u2019re able to get on to an enemy carry, you will increase your chances of winning a fight."}
{"text": "As riven, Very mobile with its e et t which allows it to emerge from sticky situations with ease. This makes it a threat to the enemy rear line. Its Ultimate e can allow it to easily execute low-health champions. This becomes really valuable in a team struggle. It has its own form of CC on its r which, when combined with its dashes can allow it to land a multi-man stun. This will allow its teammates to follow the set."}
{"text": "As sejuani, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game. Getting them and securing the Dragon Soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nLook for picks with your team. If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand has a lot of poke with its W with the added advantage of being long-range as well. This allows it to poke the enemy from afar and to make them low. Its Ultimate R is really good in team fighting- especially if the enemy are grouped. It can bounce its Ultimate R between enemies and inflict a lot of damage. Brand is able to complete his quest for guard incredibly quickly that he can constantly harass the enemy from afar."}
{"text": "As poppy, Your presence makes it very difficult for the enemy to escape because they can't go near the ground. Work with your Support and invade the enemy Jungle whenever possible. This will allow you to easily fix the vision around, as well as get choices. You will want to make the team fights unfair by stalling enemies when they are overstretched or play carelessly. Try not to go too far from your team while doing this."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Yuumi's first element will give her an important boost of power as she can spam her E frequently in the track. It will allow her and her to go for more frequent jobs. Once she reaches level 6, she will become impressively skilled to disengage. Her level 2 is a small peak of power because she will have access to all her abilities at that time. She can now use her Passive and E to continue to do short poke jobs and protect her ADC after that."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana is really weak up to level six because she doesn't have a reliable way to ruin the enemies. She should focus on agriculture and reach level six as quickly as possible to start impact fighting. When Shyvana resumes her first element, it will allow her to clean the camps quickly and inflict a lot of damage during the duels. He will help her blow her enemies as soon as she gets her Ultimate t too. Her objective control is really great because of the speed with which she can capture the goals."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Level 9 will see her first ability being maxed out. This will result in a massive damage increase and immediately make her a high priority target for the enemy.\n\nHer kit is superb during team fights. She can immediately turn the tide of a battle with a well-placed Ultimate R and help her allies secure crucial objectives during this phase.\n\nLevel 11 will be another spike for Qiyana, this time in damage increase and reduced cooldown. She will be pretty effective in objective fights and securing picks.        "}
{"text": "As vladimir, His early game is terrible, and he should avoid fighting for more extended periods during this game phase. Focus on scaling up and getting your first item.\n\nLevel six is a decent power spike. It allows Vladimir to unleash his burst combo and develop a decent amount of kill pressure in the lane. It will allow him to impact fights quite easily from now on.\n\nThe first item component will give him a significant damage boost. It will also increase his overall survivability in the lane.

Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning.

If you spot him, don\u2019t automatically try to fight him as he is incredibly strong early on.\n\nOnce Graves hit\u2019s level 6, his duelling power increases dramatically. Continue to avoid fighting him when he has his Ultimate t as he will beat most Junglers unless he\u2019s behind."}

If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate R is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on.

Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your Q. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}
{"text": "As sett, His ultimate R allows him both to get tanks from his carts and to inflict a lot of damage on the enemy team if he manages to ulterate his target on them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant. His passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so that he can resort to short tracks against enemy champions unlike other tanks. His W makes such high misleading damage, while providing him with mitigation of damage."}

{"text": "As heimerdinger, If the enemy team focuses on destroying its Q turrets before invading it, it will have to play defensively until it can bring back its turrets. Missing its E will put it in a vulnerable place, especially if it is laning on its own or when it is pushed upwards. This error can easily cause it to kill. It is very effective when fighting in closed spaces like the Jungle. The enemy can reduce this by fighting in the tracks and then matching its thrust if he tries to divide the thrust."}

Be on the lookout to secure the peaks when inside the enemy Jungle. The enemy Support and Jungler will have to put the vision up, which makes them first choice targets. Get rid of them and then use the advantage of numbers to win a fight. If you see one of the enemies door in the side tracks, see if you can flank them from the fog of war and kill them quickly. This can be done very easily, even when the target is near their turn, due to your ultimate distance of travel R."}

It is effortless for her to use the track brushes and to shoot down the enemies even before they can react. Level 6 is a significant peak of power. It can now take the entire enemy team, especially if they find themselves involved in nature. It will also strengthen its all-in-potential potential significantly. Getting its first element will give it a necessary boost during the duels. It will survive longer in the fighting while simultaneously inflicting more damage to the enemies."}
{"text": "Against anivia, Anivia is a very mana-hungry champion and will need blue buff as often as possible. While she's weak on mana, use this as an opportunity to refuse her farm. When you're wandering around the map, make sure to keep an eye on the minion wave in the middle. Anivia can push the wave very quickly and you will lose a lot of the health of the tower if you're gone for too long. Try and wander while she's at the base so she can't take your turn. CC is your best friend against Anivia because she's squishy and still. But she has tools to defend herself like her ts and e. To make her easier, try to corner her instead of running directly on her to make it harder for her to escape."}

You will want to make sure that you position yourself well and look out for assassins who try to kill you.\n\nCorrectly use your e during this phase of the game and shield as many people as you can.

Your Ultimate R is an excellent skirmishing tool, and you can get early kills with it."}
{"text": "As rumble, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily.

{"text": "Against amumu, Once Aumu gets tons of cooldown reduction, his Ultimate will be on a shorter cooldown. This allows him to gank more often and have more success when it comes to deganking. Depending on the construction, you will need either to invest in a armor pen if you are an AD champion, or a magic pen if you are an AP champion. If it will damage, you may need some defensive elements. As the game goes on, it will become stronger and stronger, and tankier and tankier."}

If is picked into a team that lacks a lot of damage, transforming into them might be uneventful. \n\nViego is a difficult champion to master: in particular, playing around your Passive and your R can be quite challenging for beginners.\n\nViego has low utility and his W cannot help him get over walls. This is a drawback compared to other mobile champions in the current meta."}
{"text": "As veigar, At this stage of the game, you want to put yourself in a side lane and focus on getting stacks so you have a stronger late game.\n\nIn the later parts of the mid-game and when the enemy starts to group, make sure you follow suit and start to group with your team.\n\nLook for picks with your n. If you can catch someone out during the mid game with it, your team should be able to kill them pretty quickly. Once you\u2019ve killed someone, make the call for Drake or Baron."}
{"text": "As kayle, A very weak early game causes her to have no form of lane presence. She is an easy gank target at this point, and shutting her down at this point of the game is very easy.\n\nShe is quite prone to CC abilities, especially when her Ultimate R is down to buy her some time for the CC to wear out. Even in fights, she will need to be careful, else she will get chain CC\u2019d and deleted.\n\nAs far as her playstyle is concerned, she will be focused on catching the side waves and not accompanying her team most of the time. This gives the enemy team a huge advantage over her team in terms of numbers and sustenance."}
{"text": "As maokai, If Maokai throws a Sapling in a bush, you can walk up to it and then detach yourself from the path with your E so that it does not damage you. If a wave is nearby, run to it. The damage of the explosion of its Sapling will be on the wave that will force it to push towards you that leaves it in a vulnerable place for a whole in. The extended trades work heavily in your favor against Maokai. Try to keep them going as long as possible as it will not be able to damage you early. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will force Maokai to expand if he wants to grow. Keep the wave here also allows you to zone it away from the farm, or aggressively trade if he tries to hit a minion for the last time. Maokai can escape your W and dodge your Q's easily with his W. Or wait for his W to be on the cooling before committing to fight or lure him and use his superhesive positioning to finish your combo."}
{"text": "As varus, At level 16, Varus will be able to add 3 points in his Ultimate R. It will increase the damage inflicted by the ability while simultaneously reducing the cooldown. Varus will have a lot of articles during this stage of the game. This will allow him to cover a lot of damage, and his potential for bursting due to his W will be phenomenal. Varus is excellent in team fighting due to his Q and Ultimate R. A good Ultimate R can literally allow the Varus team to win a meaningful battle with minimal effort."}
{"text": "As lillia, CC'ing her is of paramount importance. Use your Q to knock her up when possible. Once she is CC'd, beat her up. \n\nWatch out for early healing reduction from her end in this matchup. Not doing so can allow Lillia to outduel you.\n\nLillia will have a tendency to poke you and your allies from a distance and then ult and go for the kill. You may want to use your Flash, or the fog of war to go for the enemy team in such a case. This way, your team can deal with Lillia as they wake up while you can use your abilities to zone off the enemies.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and just focus on farming. Remember to stay away from terrain as it can let her splash her E."}
{"text": "Against singed, Expect Singed to stay apart form his team during the mid and late game. He will try to split push and take objectives. Make sure someone who can contest him is sent to a side lane to stop him.\n\nForcing team fights when Singed is unable to influence them is a great idea and forcing a fight 4v4 or 5v4 will help you win the game.\n\nIf Singed does join the team fight, you\u2019ll need to disengage and back off whenever he engages otherwise he could use his g to Fling someone into his team. Disengage and poke will reduce his chances of getting a good g off."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Avoid walking too far forward in team fights. If Morgana lands her Q, she could easily follow up and take you down.\n\nMorgana\u2019s Black Shield E has a really long cooldown. If you can bait it out, you should look to re-engage and try to kill her while it\u2019s down.\n\nAvoid grouping too close together in team fights as it could allow Morgana to get a really good Ultimate R off. Splitting up slightly makes it much harder for her to CC your whole team"}
{"text": "As yuumi, As Yuumi has a lot of built-in sustain, make sure you get some form of healing reduction quickly to make it easier for you to kill them.\n\nYuumi's a squishy champion. If you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map, you can force them to over extend and then all-in or fight Yuumi when they overextend.\n\nDon\u2019t let Yuumi harass and poke you down. If you lose a lot of health, you\u2019ll never be in a position to play aggressively. Watch your positioning, dodge Yuumi's damage and don\u2019t let them abuse you for free.\n\nKeep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them (her or the ADC) after they\u2019ve used an ability as they cannot use it to trade back with. Yuumi is less of a threat when they have an ability down.\n"}
{"text": "As ekko, His W allows him to engage upon a group or enemy champions, or a single enemy champion with ease. This is really beneficial if he can land it from out of vision and then use his E to dash into the W circle to guarantee the stun.\n\nHis burst damage is not to be ignored as the game goes on. This is especially true when he happens to be ahead in the game. He can quite literally take the enemy backline out in one rotation of spells, if he manages to W E onto them.\n\nHis Ultimate R is the most powerful ability in his kit as it allows him to undo his mistakes, especially when he chooses a bad fight or fails an all-in. As the game goes on, the cooldown of this ability becomes shorter, allowing him to do whatever he pleases as long as he has his Ultimate R up."}
{"text": "As skarner, Good vision control can make it really difficult for him to gank lanes with his E and Ultimate. He must avoid these warding locations if he wants to get ahead.\n\nSkarner is prone to CC, which makes using both his E and Ultimate quite difficult. To fully use these abilities, you must look for situations where you cannot be interrupted.\n\nIf the enemy team splits up, or if the frontline is always blocking the enemy carries, it will be hard to use your Ultimate on a carry champion. Using your Ult on a tank isn\u2019t really worth it.\n"}
{"text": "As sion, Sion is weak in the very early game. He needs to get some levels behind him before he can start to gank.\n\nPost 6, Sion can gank lanes from afar with his Ultimate R. Look for ganks whenever your Ultimate R is up.\n\nSion\u2019s early game power spikes depend on what build he goes for: if he goes tank, he will be weaker early, if he goes damage he will be obnoxious and strong.\n"}
{"text": "As gragas, The neutral objective fights and fights in the river will be your bread and butter when it comes to accumulating an advance in the game. Block the choking point with your Q whenever possible. In a team fight, always try to separate an enemy from their team. Bonus points if the target is still and has no form of escape, as it would be a guaranteed killer. Make sure that the neutral objective pit is out of bounds for the enemy Jungler during the fights. It will help your Jungler secure the lens quickly and without any risk of running out of smit."}
{"text": "As chogath, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nUse your e to initiate a fight or try to pick someone off with it and then kill them. Once they\u2019re dead, either move to Baron or the Elder Dragon or siege and try to end the game.\n\nMake the call for objectives like the Baron or Elder Dragon when an enemy is dead and when your Ultimate t is up. Use your Ultimate t to secure the objective for your team."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Putting the second point in Fiddlesticks Ultimate R at level 11 is very important for him. It will put his Ultimate R on a shorter cooldown and allow him to look for more aggressive plays.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Fiddlesticks should\u2019ve completed an item or two. His damage output will be quite high which can allow him to win mid-game team fights.\n\nIn the mid-game, teams start to group. This is good for Fiddlesticks as he benefits from teams grouping closely together as his Ultimate R is an AOE tool."}
{"text": "As shen, Peel for your carries in late-game team fights to increase the chances of your team winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them; otherwise, the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus on the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}

{"text": "As orianna, Another point in its Ultimate d will increase the damage to the ability and let it play games frequently. Several elements will allow it to take the game easily. It should be part of as many fights as possible. The first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will bring a lot of damage to the enemy team and increase the frequency of use of this ability."}
{"text": "As chogath, The enemy will not be ganking much in the early game, so try your hardest to get as many ganks off as possible. Getting your allies ahead will only make the enemy fall behind and make their Jungler useless.\n\nPrioritize taking Dragons early. You can solo the Dragon with ease, or you can request assistance and rotate to it after helping bot. Make sure you secure all the Dragons when possible to deny them from the enemy.\n\nWhile the enemy Jungler will not be ganking, fighting them alone will be difficult as they have tools to escape or prevent the fight. If you spot them alone, try to force them out of their jungle without over committing to the fight without assistance. A good time to invade and look for them is when your lanes nearby have priority.\n\nAt level 6 is when the enemy will probably start ganking. You can track them with good vision through wards placed in and around the river. If you\u2019re nearby, try to counter gank as they have nothing to offer once they\u2019ve used their abilities which you can capitalise on. If you\u2019re not nearby, start the Dragon or try to gank a different lane."}
{"text": "As twitch, You will be powerful uber during this phase of the game. Make sure that you do nothing that can get you caught and killed as it would mean a Baron or Dragon free for the team. Your k and Ultimate c will allow you to run around the map and blow squishies up if you go for AP construction. If you go for AD construction, just focus on cleaning through the enemy team with your Ultimate c. Getting a defensive element should help you a lot because it will keep you alive for a longer period, especially if you go for a secondary ADC construction."}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, In team fights, Jarvan IV will look to lock down as many champions as he can with his Ultimate m. Make sure you\u2019re grouped as a team but not grouped so close together that he can lock everyone in his Cataclysm m.\n \nJarvan\u2019s gameplay is not very creative when it comes to fighting. Warding basic areas like bushes or chokepoints will likely spot Jarvan before he gets the chance to flank or gank.\n \nIf you can interrupt Jarvan in his combo at the start of the fight, it will be very difficult for him to get his Ultimate m off or escape after engaging. As soon as he runs towards you, either disengage or lock him down with CC."}
{"text": "Against gwen, When you fight Gwen alone, try and only commit to fighting when she doesn't have a lot of batteries or she will do a lot of damage to you. Gwen is a heavy jungler skirmish in early play. If she ganks a way and you can't contest it, try to invade her jungle on the opposite side of the map or gank another way to equal her pressure. Gwen has a very good objective control and can solo the Dragon and Rift Herald frequently. Place the vision to spot it before she is able to take these goals alone."}
{"text": "Against zac, The Zacs E can be used from afar to start the team fight. Make sure to keep your flanks by sipping a goal. Avoid fighting in the jungle as it will be easier for Zac to land his E and hit your entire team with his Ultimate R. Fight in the open if possible. Do not regroup too closely. If you are slightly separated, it will be impossible for Zac to catch up and hit your entire team with his E and Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As aphelios, Although while you're good in the last game, it's important that you don't act like Aphelios is very squishy. In the last game, Aphelios will be in full construction or almost completion of its construction. He will be able to cover a lot of damage in the fighting of the team of the end of the game. Aphelios is a strong team combat champion. He should group with his team and play as 5. He will be able to melt tanks at this stage of the game, as long as he looks at his positioning and is not caught."}
{"text": "Against aurelionsol, Aurelion is quite vulnerable to ganks since it has to push the wave. But, it can use its W to escape from one. Make sure you don't waste your gap closer if it has its W or Ultimate available so you can catch it if it tries to escape. When Aurelion Sol pushes and wanders, make sure you ping as soon as it disappears. Try to push back the wave and start taking Tower plates if you are unable to match its roaming. Try and abuse Aurelion Sol, Q cooldown. Once it is down, it is very vulnerable. Look for favorable jobs when it is missing."}

You should be able to gank enemies freely once you unlock your W and E and instigate tower dives on low-health enemies.\n\nAlways look to gank overextended enemies when possible. Your kit will let you CC the enemy to oblivion and will allow you to burst them down just as quickly.\n\nUnlocking your Ultimate R will make it relatively easy for you to gank your enemies.

When your Q is on cooldown; you\u2019re pretty vulnerable and will lose 1v1 fights.\n\nMake sure you make use of your Passive empowered auto.

{"text": "As seraphine, The third point of her Ultimate R will help S\u00e9raphine a lot during team fighting. She can dry up a lot of damage, and the CC will allow her team to collapse on the enemy quickly. She should be really great because she will get all her articles by then. She will have to take care of her combat positioning to make sure she is not taken care of. Her selection potential will only increase during this phase of the game because her E and Ultimate R should be beneficial."}
{"text": "As zed, Make sure that you get to level 3 really fast in this game. It will allow you to execute ganks easily and get a quick lead over the enemy.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to blow up your opposition regularly. Look for picks all around the map and keep a track of recently finished fights.\n\nOnce you get your first item, your burst damage will be really high. Just make sure that you don't get CC'd during a major all-in else you will definitely end up dying."}
{"text": "Against viego, In team fights, as soon as Viego runs in, try to CC him and burst him down first. He is pretty vulnerable to CC and if you can kill him before he gets his combo off, the enemy will lose out on a lot of damage.\n\nKeep track of who he can change into at the start and during a fight. Try to play accordingly to all of his potential new abilities.\n\nTry and avoid fighting in the river or in the jungle as Viego\u2019s E can make him very hard to kill. It is better to fight in the open or after he has used his E. His E allows him to be super slippery."}

Thanks to Zyra\u2019s AOE abilities, she will be rather good during this stage in the game as she will be able to deal damage to multiple enemy champions at once.\n\nZyra would\u2019ve also completed multiple items when the mid-game roles around. Because of this, your abilities will deal a lot more damage which will allow you to pick of squishy targets.\n\nAt level 9, Zyra would\u2019ve maxed either her Q or her E. Regardless of which one you maxed first, you should be able to deal a lot of damage to the enemy laner during the mid-game or the later parts of the laning phase."}

Either way, he will be dealing a plethora of damage and will excel in clumped fights.\n\nYorick's second ability will be maxed out at level 14. This means that dueling him will become really hard for the enemy, and Yorick will be able to turn a fight on its head easily."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine has low basic statistics and is quite vulnerable in early play. Play safe and avoid taking damage to increase your survival. Seraphine lacks an escape tool. This reduces her chances of escaping skill strokes and makes it more difficult for her to escape from an all-in enemy. The shield and cure you get from your W is missing enough, especially in early play. Do not rely on it to save you or your ADC life."}

Anyone who gets caught out by Urgot will probably end up dying due to the sheer amount of damage he can dish out in a short time.\n\nUrgot is really tanky during the late game. Due to his items, he will have a respectable amount of sustain, which will make it really hard for the enemy to kill him.\n\nTeam fights will be Urgot's bread and butter as he can front line quite effectively while dishing out tons of damage to the enemy team.

The ground engineer on her Q can easily allow her drags to play in the middle of the track as she can continue to block her enemies with continuous Qs."}
{"text": "As braum, Braum\u2019s first power spike is when he reaches level 3. When he has access to all his basic abilities, he can start being more proactive and have some lane pressure. Up until that time, he can\u2019t exactly do too much.\n\nBraums next significant power spike is once he reaches level 6. Unlocking Braum\u2019s Ultimate r is very important and once he reaches this power spike, he can start to actively look for all-ins with his ADC.\n\nWhen Braum has upgraded his Boots, he can start to roam around the map. Getting an early pair of Boots and upgrading them will often give him lane priority which can help him roam before the enemy."}
{"text": "Against yuumi, Yuumi is strong once she has finished her first article. In this team, her exit of healing and damage will increase. Once Yuumi is level 6 and when she unlocks her Ultimate R, her pressure of death increases, but also her survival in the way. Team fighting is good for Yuumi as she can empower her carriers."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, He is a mage, so any form of silence or channel interruption spell is his weakness. This is especially true if someone manages to interrupt his Ultimate R, as that is the ability that can single-handedly turn the tide of a team fight.\n\nGrievous Wounds are quite effective against him. He is quite squishy as well so he won\u2019t be able to do much if the enemy team gets healing reduction during the early game.\n\nHis biggest weakness is an enemy team that can ward well. This will legitimately counter Fiddlesticks entirely and will prevent him from all-inning the enemy team consistently. The vision will allow the enemy to anticipate his move and react accordingly."}

{"text": "As teemo, Its passive can be really heinous to manage, especially when it hides in a brush and moves in and out while peeling its laner with its ts and ts. It is the jerk of the ADC sector as its t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks.

The Ultimate t can act as a substitution to the vision, as well as do a lot of damage when it is kept in the right places."}

Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off with your E and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning.

Very sensitive to the CC, so if the enemy saves their CC for him, he will die."}
{"text": "As poppy, Her Q can easily be ruled out because it has a very short range. Can be easily killed if she overextends with her E.

It is especially true if the enemy team has a kind of heavy commitment that can get on her team."}
{"text": "As yorick, Yorick is not powerful early, and he should focus on scale farming. He can do it easily by using track brushes to drop the vision while using his balls simultaneously to keep the enemies out of him. Level 6 is an important power peak as he can now divide the thrust very well. He will also help him win duels as the Maiden does a lot of damage to the enemies. His first element will allow him to get greater damage and durability in the way. He can quickly push his wave and then remember and be back even before the enemy wave hits his own turn."}
{"text": "As jax, Once you get your basics, you should look for skirmishes all around the map. Focus on the glove of the pushed enemy tracks. When you go for neutral goals, make sure you get rid of the enemy Jungler with your os and self-attacks. It will make sure you don't spoil a smit. Fighting in the bottlenecks should help you a lot during this phase of the game. Work with your support to define the vision around the map to know where you can catch the Jungler."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Always keep an eye on what Ultimate Sylas has. If her Ultimate R is a very strong Ultimate combat team, try to wait for it to cool down before forcing a fight. Look at the flanks as Sylas will often try to flank a combat team with her E to get started. Make sure no one in your team is standing too much before or out of position as it can allow Sylas to choose them with her E and start the team fight."}

By relying on elements to win the game. If he is put back in place during the early game, he won, he can't do much in the late match as he just fell. If he manages to get an early advance, he can be able to snowball if left unchecked. He falls massively even though the more the game goes, the worse it is for Lucian."}
{"text": "As malzahar, He is vulnerable when his shield is lowered. If the enemy can destroy the shield, they can use the cooldown to play aggressively and get himself killed. By using his Ultimate R, he will be motionless. This makes him vulnerable to incoming damage and CC that could in turn have him killed."}
{"text": "As soraka, Consider investing in healing reduction items or abilities to counter Soraka's sustain. This can help reduce their ability to heal and trade effectively during skirmishes and all-ins.\n\nMaintain the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This encourages Soraka and their ADC to overextend, creating opportunities for your jungler to gank and potentially secure kills or summoner spells.\n\nTake advantage of windows of opportunity to detach from your ADC and harass Soraka when they've used one of their abilities. This puts them at a disadvantage in trades, as they have one less ability to trade back effectively.\n\nBe aware that at level 6, Soraka's ultimate ability, Wish, can be used to heal her allies across the map. It's important to ping and communicate with your team when Soraka hits level 6, so they can be cautious and adjust their play accordingly."}

It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you will miss out on a lot of potential kill pressure.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer.

You want to hit your mid-game powerspike very quickly, and farming your camps is an effective way of doing it.\n\nTry to gank lanes that you are near to, especially if the enemy is pushed up. The same rule applies for counter ganks, but ensure that your W and E are up before ganking.\n\nIf you happen to be on the other side of the map when the enemy jungler is ganking your laners, just try to make sure that you invade the enemy jungle and steal as many camps as you can. This way, you won't fall behind."}
{"text": "As seraphine, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nLook for picks during the mid-game. If you can pick someone off with the help from your allies, you can abuse their death timer to earn more gold and possibly take a tower, an objective or get more kills."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar has a great potential of choice with his Ultimate R. Picking a champion could win you the game! Malzahar has a shield that will protect him from incoming damage. This increases your survival in the way. You have a great clear wave thanks to your Q, W and E. Once you have an element behind you, you can constantly push the enemy in their turn."}
{"text": "As bard, Your goal is to hit level two before the enemy and look for an all-in with your Q. Hold onto your Q till you get a bit closer to your target, or use it when the target is pinned against a wall.\n\nKeep collecting chimes while you are laning. You need to unlock the slow on your auto-attacks and getting 5 chimes will allow you to do so. Once that is done, you can land your Q very easily.\n\nAlways be on the lookout for roams around the map. The best time to do it will be when the minion wave is pushing to you and you have left lane to collect some chimes. Use your E properly and maybe pair up with your Jungler for maximum effectiveness."}
{"text": "As masteryi, A maximum of Ultimate r will allow Master Yi to mow the enemy team. This is very beneficial when it comes to cleaning up late battles. His damage will be massive during the end of the game. He can continue on all enemies that his Ultimate r will rise quite frequently. His team fight is on another level during this phase of the game. This means that he will be the pivot for the success of his team, and his use will determine the result of the game."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel anyone with your n trying to stop you from pushing into the division. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to take in the vicinity."}
{"text": "As rumble, Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs. As you are not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}
{"text": "As teemo, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Kassadin is at his weakest in the early game. Try to fight as much as possible so he falls behind.\n\nPost level 6, if you have any CC abilities, do not use them unless his Ultimate k is down as he will use their cooldowns to play aggressive and trade with you. \n\nKassadin lacks wave clear in the early game. If you can keep the wave closer to your side of the map early on, it will be very difficult for him to farm or break your freeze. If he does walk up to last hit, you can look to trade with him."}
{"text": "As teemo, His Passive can be really obnoxious to deal with, especially when he is hiding in a brush and moving in and out while pelting his laner with his t and t.\n\nHe is the bane of ADC mains as his t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the effectiveness of the carry for a while, which gives his team some time to engage/disengage freely.\n\nThe Ultimate t can act as a substitution for vision, as well as deal a lot of damage when kept in the right spots. This is especially useful when it comes to avoiding ganks."}
{"text": "As zeri, At level 16, Zeri will put the final point in her Ultimate R. Her Ultimate R will now deal maximum damage in fights.\n\nTeam fights are really where she shines. Depending on her build, she will be really strong and can deal a ton of damage in a fight.\n\nIn the late game, she should be near full build. As long as she positions well and kites, she will be very good in team fights."}
{"text": "As shen, His tankess will be quite powerful during this phase of the game. He will not take any damage and will act as a reliable front line for his team. A maximum of Ultimate R will help him save his allies frequently. He will also allow him to share the push very effectively, as he can join a fight from anywhere on the map. He is great in the fights of the end of the game because of his kit, because he can play both aggressively and defensively at the same time. His ability to deny the damage will be the final nail on the coffin of his enemies during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "Against lulu, When you're not looking to commit yourself, then step back so that it can't attack you automatically. Until Lulu uses his E before fighting or throwing is a good way to get out of the front. Try to lure that ability and then play aggressive as it cools. Post 6 and when Lulu gets his Ultimate R, his survival increases a lot. Keep in mind that it's going to be hard for you to kill her when her Ultimate R is up. Don't commit to the whole unless he comes down or she comes out of mana."}
{"text": "As maokai, They will be gloved early, and Pantheon can gank early, too. Make sure you apply as much pressure on them as you can. Post 6, it's best to avoid fighting it unless you have a clear advantage, because it will take some time for you to kill it because of its tankyness and Ultimate. Place the vision around the map to help you spot it before it can gank your allies. Maokai is a strong early ganker. Don't forget to secure these goals. You have good objective control, so make sure to use it!"}
{"text": "Against akshan, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make its all-in less effective. Post 6, try to interrupt or in some way or force Akshan to top its Ultimate. This will increase your survival and it will be put on a short cooldown. Keep in mind that the early armor will be very beneficial in this matchup. Akshan is an AD champion, so picking up the early armor will protect you from some of its damage."}
{"text": "As nami, Levels 2 and 3 are decent peaks because Nami will catch the enemies and buffer the damage of his ally accordingly. This will help him to take the track easily. Level 6 is a massive peak as it can add another layer of CC to his entire combo CC. It will compensate for an excellent ability to track CC. Its first element will allow him to inflict a lot of damage in the track while obtaining a decent amount of regeneration of the mana. It can now use its capabilities frequently."}
{"text": "As nasus, Make sure you use your Q to kill monsters regularly. It's a sure way to get multiple batteries and take the game later. It would be better if you avoid any conflict and focus on stacking your Q up. It's a really safe way to move forward in the game. Make sure you put some vision around Jungle's entries to check the invasions. It will allow your team to collapse on the enemy if they decide to invade."}
{"text": "As quinn, Purchasing more items will increase her damage output significantly. She should try to abuse her laner early on with her basic abilities.\n\nHer W should provide her with a lot of vision while roaming around in unwarded territory. The attack speed increase is very potent, as well.\n\nHer Q will come in very handy in fights that occur in tight spaces. She can quite possibly land a five-man blind, which will be huge for her team.\n"}
{"text": "Against aurelionsol, It will heal a lot and inflict surprising damage when you return with you. Although it is not always practical, once Aurelion reaches level 3, it will unlock its main roaming capacity. Ping as soon as it will disappear because it is not unknown from the Aurelion roaming to the bot track at level 3. When Aurelion reaches level 6, it will try to make good use of its Ultimate. If it cannot kill you in the way, it will make sure to use it elsewhere. Once its Ultimate is standing and it has gone, contact your team."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan IV is a strong early game duelist so it should be easy for you to all-in your enemy regularly and keep chunking them in the lane using the lane brushes.\n\nYou will have to help your Jungler in case he is near your lane and is trying to take down the Rift Herald. The goal is to make sure that you can use your CC combo effectively regularly.\n\nGetting your Ultimate m will help you a lot in this matchup, especially during the neutral objective fights where you can lock the enemy Jungler down with ease.        "}
{"text": "Against milio, Be wary of his range if you are a champion of melee because he will constantly seek to intimidate you with his superior range. At level 6, he gains more utility so that it can be difficult to get murders on the ADC enemy, but his Ultimate is on a long cooldown so you can abuse this to get killed. If he uses his Q aggressively and lacks, try to play aggressively while he imagines the cooldown as his main way of bringing you down."}
{"text": "As anivia, Stick with your team throughout the late game. If you\u2019re caught out of position, the enemy may be able to end the game. You need to ensure your Passive is up in team fights to increase your chances of winning.\n\nCounter pushes from the enemy team is a must in the late game. Stick with your team and use your Ultimate m to prevent the enemy from sieging objectives. This will make it hard for them to destroy your tier 3 towers.\n\nKeep your Wall e off cooldown at all times in case you need to use it to disrupt the enemy or interrupt an engage. If you use it in the late game, you\u2019re going to be vulnerable."}
{"text": "As missfortune, This champion is pretty immobile and is prone to CC. If they get caught out by any CC, they will probably die. In particular, when she channels her Ultimate e she is vulnerable.\n\nUnlike a lot of ADC\u2019s, she doesn\u2019t have a dash or escape ability. This can be a huge problem for her throughout the game.\n\nMiss Fortune isn\u2019t very good in 1v1s and her outplay potential isn\u2019t the best. Due to her Passive, she is rather weak in 1v1s unless she is ahead or can get a really good Ultimate e off."}
{"text": "As camille, In the supporting role, she has great potential to pick with her E and Ultimate. She can catch any enemy who surpasses post 6. She can constantly pick up murders in the way with her Ultimate. If you can't get murders in the way, watch to wander and help your allies instead. Camille can play aggressive from the back and forth."}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, Always make sure behind a minion so it is harder for him to land his Q. If he is able to land his Q, he can look for a fight. As soon as Tahm Kench activates his Grey Health E, disengage from the fight because he will offer him protection and you may be unable to kill him through the health.t bonus have an impact 2v2 Ultimate R. If you are stronger at level 6, be ready to fight him. Try and stay within maximum reach and behind the minions at all times. This will make it harder for him to hit you with his Q or self-attack you."}
{"text": "Against orianna, Avoid fighting around goals, near Tours and in the jungle as it can allow Orianna to get a multi-person Ultimate d and win the team fight. Try to divide as much as possible (stand away from each other) so Orianna is not allowed to land a good Ultimate d. If Orianna has a strong front line, keep an eye on their positioning especially if she has her Ball D on them. If the enemy front line runs towards you, turn off as quickly as you can so that they are not able to set up its Ultimate d."}
{"text": "As nidalee, Nidalee needs to move forward in the early game to be useful in the later parts of the game. If she is not able to snowball, her playing environment will disappear. Has an incredibly high skill cape. She is one of the most difficult junglers to learn thanks to her s, unique combos thanks to her r, and the constant need for jungle kite camps. Although Nidalee is incredibly mobile, she is subject to CC. If they get caught by any CC, they will probably die."}
{"text": "As karma, Once your bottom lane rotates to the top lane, go to a side lane and start to farm. Try not to fall behind in gold and XP by sharing it with your ADC and Support.\n\nIn team fights, use your empowered d to provide a large shield to your allies. Unless you need to use your d or Q, you should try to use your d to help them survive.\n\nDelay team fights for as long as possible in the mid game while you poke and harass the enemy with your Q."}
{"text": "As teemo, At level 6, Teemo can place tons of mushroom t around the track. This can help it prevent enemy Jungler's ganks, and make it more difficult for the enemy bot track to play aggressive. Teemo is very early and can intimidate the enemy down a ton. However, it depends heavily on the matchup and it must always position carefully so that it does not take unnecessary damage."}
{"text": "Against bard, Bard\u2019s early game is quite strong thanks to his empowered auto-attacks. Try not to let him bully and harass you for free otherwise you\u2019ll never be able to engage or fight him- especially if you\u2019re melee.\n\nBard\u2019s level 6 power spike is not as strong as some champions as his Ultimate R doesn\u2019t deal any damage. If you have a damaging Ultimate, you\u2019ll be able to beat him at level 6. Or, you\u2019ll at least force him to use his Ultimate R defensively. \n\nAs the game goes along, Bard becomes stronger and stronger as he collects more chimes. Keep this in mind when playing against him."}
{"text": "As quinn, Make sure you participate in neutral objective fighting and blind several people with your Q. This ability will do a lot of damage and allow you to break the enemy out. You can try to be an osedevil and look for flanks on the enemy rear line with your ultimate R. That being said, make sure you have a defensive element or escape plan if things go south. Focus the closest enemy champion to your portages and work as a team to take the enemy one by one. If you focus on the rear line alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. By focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your portages alive."}
{"text": "As poppy, During team fighting, make sure that the enemy cannot approach your carts and absorb as much damage as possible for them. Use your passive to defend yourself. Buying a defensive item will help you a lot in this game. It will allow you to all enemies freely, and the enemy will take a lot of time to try to kill you. Cling to the enemy door like glue to create a flaw between the enemy front line and the rear line. This way, the enemy will certainly lose the fight, and then you can win the game."}
{"text": "As evelynn, With this in mind, try to secure the first Dragons to get your team in advance. One way to do this is to glove the middle or the bot and then turn straight after. As Evelynn will not be gloved early, try gank as much as you can to get your allies ahead Evelynn is weak in the beginning of the game and will try to feed the farm up to level 6. Try to invade him to delay his level 6 power point. Try to follow her through a good vision placed in her jungle. Pre-6, this will help your team to know where she is and post 6 it will help reduce the ganks. Control Wards in the bushes and Yellow Wards on her camps will make the follow-up easy."}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz is an incredibly weak champion up until at least level 3. If he gets poked down, he will not be able to look for an early all-in or first blood.\n\nEven though he is incredibly mobile with his E, when it is on cooldown, he is incredibly squishy and immobile. Even with his E available, he is pretty squishy if he gets hit with CC. \n\nFizz needs to get ahead early to do well in the later stages of the game. If he loses lane or doesn\u2019t have a lot of gold, he will not be much of a threat in the mid-game."}

You must take Rift Heralds and Drakes whenever you can!\n"}
{"text": "Against quinn, Once Quinn reaches level 6, her death pressure in a trade does not increase exactly as her Ultimate R is a utility tool. However, her ability to wander does. If she leaves the track, ping your teammates so they know that she is missing. Keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map in early play will allow you to get gold and XP without fear of Quinn zoner and deny you the farm."}
{"text": "As trundle, You will want to stay with your ADC and your team as much as you can. In addition, neutral objective fights will be your bread and butter. Ward up correctly and work with your Jungler to secure the choices as much as possible. Warding will allow you to make several e and e games. After entering with your e and e, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in team fights. A good time to do so will be when you have used your h and your Ultimate n is about to run out."}
{"text": "As sona, She can't do much if she gets camped in the track. Has no form of priority in the track at the beginning of the game as her Q makes scanty amount of damage and her W is better not used until it is absolutely necessary. Missing her ultimate R guarantees a team battle victory for the enemy team and reduces the usefulness of Sona. Misuse of her passive can give the same results."}
{"text": "Against shen, Look for an aggressive level 1 game. They can easily try to get you down if you exceed. Try your toughest poke and harass the enemy, but don't engage in it because they can turn around an exchange easily. Level 6 of enemies is not very strong in 2v2 fights as their Ultimate R is a utility tool."}
{"text": "As nautilus, To avoid all-in-time opportunities and reduce Nautilus' trading potential, keeping the wave closer to your side of the card is important because you can configure your Jungler. Try and follow Nautilus' ultimate cooling post 6. It is important to do so because you don't want to be caught by Nautilus' top damage post 6. Nautilus can all-in-one level 2. If you're not in a position to hit Level 2 at the same time as them, step back so they can't all within you and kill you. You have the reach advantage, so you have to abuse! Try harassing Nautilus with basic capabilities and attacks when they walk to the last minion strike."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Level 6 is a massive peak for Mordekaiser because it can now use its Ultimate R and 1 v 1 whatever it wants. The first element will allow it to fight more effectively. Its damage will be quite important as well."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven will be looking to split push when no team fights are occurring. Make sure somebody who can contest her is sent to stop her from pushing. Avoid fighting her during the mid-game though unless you\u2019re stronger.\n\nTeamfights will be difficult for Riven as she is prone to CC, disengage and gets kited by champions easily. To make team fighting easier, she will probably flank or Flash in to engage. Ward to the side when sieging an objective to spot her before she gets the chance to engage.\n\nRiven is quite good at picking off champions when they\u2019re too far forward or alone. Don\u2019t let her pick someone off by staying in line with each other. Do not group too closely as it may allow her to get a 5 person r stun."}
{"text": "Against viego, Try to use your range advantage to intimidate and harass Viego every time he climbs to the farm. He's a mingle champion who can easily be intimidated by various champions. Viego will find it hard to kill you in the way if you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will give him less room for manoeuvre. Make sure there's a minion between you and him at all times. This will make him impossible for you CC with his W."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Vel'Koz is enormous in team fights, especially the ones which happen near the objective pits. This is mainly because clumped fights allow Vel'Koz to hit multiple targets with his abilities and proc his Passive.\n\nGetting 2 points in his Ultimate R at level 11 will be another significant power spike. He can now melt through the enemy backline and frontline alike with all the damage he will deal.\n\nMore items mean more damage for Vel'Koz. This will only make things better for him, and his team and Vel'Koz will slowly start taking over the game from here.        "}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Try to gain an early advantage by playing aggressive and blowing an early Flash. Kassadin is at his weakest during the laning phase and is highly abusable.\n\nPost level 6, if you have any CC abilities, do not use them unless his Ultimate k is down as he will use their cooldowns to play aggressive and trade with you. \n\nKassadin lacks wave clear in the early game. If you can keep the wave closer to your side of the map early on, it will be very difficult for him to farm or break your freeze. If he does walk up to last hit, you can look to trade with him."}
{"text": "As alistar, During the mid-game, teams will start to group. This is good for Alistar as it will allow him to get a multi-person knock-up with his t>e combo. \n\nIn the mid-game, Alistar\u2019s abilities will be on shorter cooldowns. This can enable him to go for more picks and increase his team's lead. \n\nIn addition to lower cooldowns, Alistar would have purchased items that make him incredibly tanky. This is good for Alistar as he will be able to take more damage and survive fights. He can also be a much beefier frontline champion."}
{"text": "As taric, His Ultimate R can stop the enemy in their tracks during a team fight. It is very versatile and can keep his allies alive for longer and completely mitigate damage.\n\nTaric\u2019s W provides his carry with bonus resistances which can be really beneficial in the long run due to carries generally not buying defensive items, especially in lower elos.\n\nHas an insane amount of cheese potential thanks to his E. He can go into the enemies jungle, surprise them and then take them down."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Kayn will try to assassinate targets that are alone during the middle of the game. Avoid walking alone through the river if you are not sure about Kayn's location. Kayn can dive tour while sitting with his E. Make sure you have your flanks monitored so you can spot him before he jumps on you or your team."}
{"text": "Against khazix, Once Kha-Zix reaches level 6, he can upgrade any of his abilities thanks to his Ultimate R. He will be much more powerful and better at the skirmish once he has an empowered ability. As Kha-Zix is a murderer, he is really good in the last stages of the game and in the middle of the game. At that time, he will try to take the card and the snowball. A Kha-Zix completes his first element, he will seek to fight more often and go for more ganks/invades."}
{"text": "As tristana, During the mid-game, you will want to work with your Jungler towards securing picks.

That is strictly an escape spell if you are trying to flank the enemy.\n\nChokepoint fights are going to be preferable for you as your E and Ultimate R can definitely disrupt the enemy team.

You could gank bot, then take Drake afterwards."}
{"text": "As nami, When playing Yuumi against Nami, it can be beneficial to keep the minion wave close to your side of the lane. This creates opportunities for your jungler to gank and potentially secure kills or summoner spells from Nami and her ADC.\n\nBe aware that at level 6, Nami's kill pressure increases significantly, especially if she lands her Aqua Prison (Q). It's crucial to be cautious and avoid getting caught by her crowd control, as it can lead to your demise or that of your ADC. Position yourself defensively and be prepared to detach and use your E (Zoomies) for the speed boost to help dodge her abilities during fights.\n\nWhen engaging in poke or dismounting to auto-attack, try to anticipate Nami's Aqua Prison and actively dodge it. Utilize the speed boost from your E ability to help you sidestep her skill shots more effectively, increasing your chances of avoiding her crowd control.\n\nConsider investing in healing reduction items early in the game to counter Nami's sustain. It can significantly reduce the effectiveness of her healing abilities, diminishing her ability to sustain herself and her ADC in trades or all-ins."}
{"text": "As viktor, His d is the only form of self-peel for him. Once that ability is down, he is quite vulnerable to ganks. In team fights, he can be flanked with ease as well.\n\nHe will be trying to play safe during the early game and will not have a lot of damage if he can\u2019t upgrade his Passive Core. Playing aggressively and forcing him out of the lane early on can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage on him.\n\nVery prone to all-ins, especially in the bot lane when against a hard crowd control Support. He has some form of movement speed buff with his r but layered crowd control can easily counter that."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, Use the minion wave to block Aatrox from landing his W and go for all-in. Always make sure there's at least one minion between you and him at all times. Both his Q and E have enough cooldowns in early play. If he uses them, try to abuse cooldowns and trade with him while they're on the ground. Aatrox benefits from unbridled trades with his Q. Try to keep your distance at all times and be willing to sacrifice some CS, so he doesn't blow you up."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Avoid regrouping closely because this will give Malphite a great opportunity to land a 5 person who strikes with his Ultimate h. Don't look for fighting in the jungle or around the Dragon or Baron. That's because the teams will usually be grouped closely together- which allows him to get a good Ultimate h off. Instead, try to fight in the open air in a way. Poke and disengagement are the biggest threats. If you can, try to bring him down as much as possible before a team fight occurs to make it almost impossible for him to engage without dying."}
{"text": "As viktor, His early game is terrible, and he should avoid fighting for more extended periods during this game phase. Focus on scaling.\n\nLevel six is a decent power spike as it allows Viktor to develop a decent amount of kill pressure in the lane. It will allow him to impact fights quite easily as well.\n\nThe first item component will give him both mana as well as wave clearing potential. This will prevent the enemy laner from roaming around freely."}
{"text": "As amumu, Stick with your team and look for picks with your s. Even taking down 1 enemy could be enough to take a major objective like the Baron or Dragon.\n\nLook for fights where the enemy is grouped closely together (such as in the jungle or around an objective) and try to CC as many enemy champions as possible.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used your Ultimate y on the enemy, ask yourself what you need to do next. Either stick to the enemy backline or peel for your carries. If the enemy has a strong all-in/frontline, be prepared to fall back and help your carries to keep them alive."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Every time Veigar uses his n, try to abuse cool down as it is his only defensive tool in early play and once it is down- it is rather vulnerable. To get ganks or kill the Veigar, you need to lure his n first. You can do it by constantly tipping in and out of reach of him. Make sure you always lure him before committing to the all-in. Veigar has really good gank configuration so make sure you still have the lower track monitored. Plus, when your Flash is down, you should always play safer so he doesn't catch you while you're ahead."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, The Level 6 power peak for Qiyana is strong enough because it gives it a changing Ultimate game that can be used in many ways. If you see it do your way, make sure you run through the middle of the way to escape. Do not stand by the walls. During the middle of the game is where Qiyana really shines. That's because she's a great team fighter thanks to her R. Unlike many other Assassins, Qiyana really favors team fight 5v5. Do not group close to the wall during this period as she might seek to engage. Once Qiyana has finished her juggling, she will look at duel and trade more frequently thanks to the extra damage and the cooling reduction it will provide."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio should be finished now. This will give it a massive peak in its ability to peel for allied carts. Its damage production will be quite high as well. The Ultimate R of Galio will always be practical during the fights due to its knockup and low cooling. It can easily divide the thrust and show up to fight with its Ultimate R in a jiffy. Level 16 is not so great a peak for Galio. Although its Ultimate R cooldown is reduced and the range of casting is increased, it will have no incentive to use it for itself."}
{"text": "As darius, Peel for your allies and keep them alive as long as possible. If you are in advance, try to shoot down the enemy rearline. If you are not strong, use your e to peel for your allies. Stay with your team in the end of the game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to choose you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team.

{"text": "As tristana, Tristana can play aggressively from level 2/3. If it can get a little poke down at level 1, it can force the enemy to blow Flash or use their consumables if it plays aggressively at level 2. At level 6, Tristana, the damage bursts dramatically increase. This combined with its E and base attacks, it can easily blow up the enemy lantern. When Tristana completes its first component element, its damage output will increase and it will be much easier for it to secure CS and gold."}
{"text": "As urgot, Urgot's early game is pretty good, especially once he gains access to all his basic abilities. He can easily all-in an enemy and then proceed to destroy them with his Passive and auto-attacks.\n\nUrgot's level six is solid as it lets him execute his targets when they are below a certain health threshold. This is really good when trying to deal with tanks.\n\nUrgot's first item component will be beneficial as it will boost his overall damage and survivability in the lane. It will be instrumental when combined with the regular usage of the lane brushes by Urgot.        "}
{"text": "As xinzhao, His ultimate R is very effective against the members of the enemy team. This will force the enemy to come in the range of his melee, which can be quite devastating for them. Seriously good objective control during the early match so that it should not be difficult for him to take early Dragons and Rift Heralds. He can also invade very freely (after having considered the priority of the track on the side he invades)."}
{"text": "As xerath, The 2 points in his Ultimate 2 will cause Xerath's damage to skyrocket. He can always impact the team's fights that are taking place away from him with ease. The only difference will be that he will be more effective in doing so. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This means that he can cut down a lot of damage with his enemies p and snipe p easily. Still enemies will have a hard time dealing with him. Xerath is really good to secure choices with his varied abilities, and his ability to impact team fights is really high. His AoE capabilities make it quite possible for him to take several enemies at once."}
{"text": "Against garen, Garen\u2019s build path can be very different from game to game. Keep an eye on his itemisation and play accordingly depending on what he is buying. If he is going full damage, you probably won\u2019t be able to fight him alone.\n \nIt will be difficult for Garen to engage or get on to carries in a team fight as he lacks hard CC. This means that he will try to flank in team fights with his Q. Make sure you ward to the side of you at all times and kite backwards as soon as he appears.\n \nAvoid wasting valuable resources like Summoner Spells or Ultimates on Garen unless you\u2019re certain you\u2019re able to kill him. Garen can quickly top up his health bar back to full thanks to his Passive which will result in your team losing out on key spells for the remaining of the fight."}
{"text": "Against zed, As Zed is an Assassin, he will look to take down targets that are walking around the map alone. Avoid moving through the river if it\u2019s not warded. Keep a constant eye on the map and do not put yourself in the same area as Zed if you don\u2019t know his exact whereabouts.\n\nExpect Zed to flank and takedown squishy targets with his Ultimate R. Ensure that your flanks are warded when sieging an objective so he cannot get the jump on you. \n\nDuring the mid-game, Zed will often be in a side lane split pushing. With this in mind, you could use the fact that he cannot impact the fight to start a team fight 4v4 or 5v4 with the numbers advantage."}

{"text": "As yone, It has a lot of utility and damage in its kit that allows it to play around its team quite often. All it has to do is to get out of its laning phase without giving the enemy a huge lead. Its E gives it a lot of off-play potential if it is used correctly. Against unsuspected enemies, this skill can be really deadly, and can help it kill safely enough. Can flank the enemy team with a relative ease and can come out of sticky situations with its E. This can send the enemy team in full panic mode and can allow your team to follow with ease."}

If she is behind, she can easily use it on an assassin in her team so that she can keep the enemy distracted from her presence.\n\nThe Q and W allows her to catch up to fleeing targets with ease and get rid of them once she is powerful enough.

Try your best to enjoy Jinx when she is in the lane alone. Jinx is rather defenseless outside of his Flash when her E is down. If she uses her E, try to exploit her weakness and use the long cooldown to go for another escarmouche."}
{"text": "As malphite, Try to hit level three as quickly as you can. It will give you a boost in your clearance speed, but your ganks will remain virtually non-existent until you are level 6. Since your first clearings are quite weak, you will want to make sure that you are not invaded. Ward Jungle entrances so that you can detect all invaders coming to you.

{"text": "As tryndamere, 3 points in his Ultimate e will not be an excellent peak of power. That's because he only ensures his prolonged survival and nothing else. He will do a lot of damage during the last parts of the game. That's because he will have several elements and will be able to duplicate anyone. His late scale of the game is phenomenal, and he can a-shot squishy enemies after slowing them down and catching them. He will give him a pivotal role in the game."}

Combined with some of his other power peaks, we will discuss, he can start to exceed the trade of many enemy champions. Cho-Gath can't trade too well until after his first back. When he takes his first component element, the trade becomes much easier for him as his damage and survival increases.

Try to catch the enemy CDA in a side track or enemy Support while they are in custody."}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, Look at the ambushes around the map. It's really good to start skirmishes and pick up weak and still champions. Keep this in mind and avoid walking on the map alone. In the team fights, once they enter with their d, they have nothing to offer and will be in an overstretched position. Use their forward positioning to play aggressive and shoot them. Constantly try to punch and harass him. Having him in poor health will prevent him from playing or positioning aggressively."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac is a great ganker early on due to his ability to execute long-ranged ganks from out of vision. The enemy team will not have enough resources for warding everything, and hence Zac can quickly capitalize on this.\n\nlevel 6 is a significant power spike as he gets access to a team fighting Ultimate R. He can use the fog of war to catch the enemy by surprise and can separate critical targets from their teammates, which will ultimately let Zac's team kill that target.\n\nThe first item component is beneficial as it gives him added sustainability. This can easily allow him to take part in extended fights, peel for his carries, and zone off the enemy backline during significant fights."}

Most of its capabilities will be maximized during this phase of the game. It can look for peaks all around the card and can set up death brushes in the Jungle."}
{"text": "As malphite, Low during the early game, especially against constant poke damage that can prevent him from regenerating his passive shield. Before six, he is quite susceptible to poke so that he will be forced to play defensively. He probably did not get any ganks either because he does not have his Ultimate h. The appropriate vision control of the enemy team will prevent Malphite from catching the out-of-guard enemy team. This will reduce his effectiveness and force him to find other ways to engage on the enemy team."}
{"text": "As jhin, On getting his Ultimate R maxed out, he will be able to deal massive amounts of damage and can completely decimate squishy targets. He will also be able to pick enemies for his team with his Ultimate R.\n\nHis 4th shot will hit like a truck during this phase of the game. This means that squishy enemies will never be safe, especially when Jhin is properly peeled by his team.\n\nHis damage output and kiting potential will increase in the late game due to his items. This also means that he will be pivotal towards securing neutral objectives."}
{"text": "As aphelios, At level 6, you are both very strong and your Ultimates will be quite powerful and the difference between winning the fight. Keep the minion wave near your side of the card to force Aphelios to overextend. It is squishy and still so that your Jungler can gank you if you keep the wave close. Fight it when it is on low ammunition to make it kill much easier. Focus on poking with your Q and W and keep the jobs short and soft."}

If you know he is without these abilities- try to fight him.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map pre-6. This will make it harder for him to jump in with his E and should overall increase your survivability in lane.\n\nZac has really good roaming potential. If he goes missing, communicate with your team as he may be roaming to the mid lane."}
{"text": "As trundle, Another point in its Ultimate n will make it more powerful when it uses it. It will have more options to choose from now as it will be the middle game.

The first ability will be maximized at level 9, making Trundle hit his enemies like a truck."}

Continue looking for choices but expect that there will be more than 1 enemy nearby. It will be difficult for you to 100 to 0 someone that many champions will be in full construction at the end of the game or at least have defensive tools like Zhonyas Hurglass or Guardian Angel at their disposal. Continue to play slow team fights. Although your cooldowns will be short, you must play around your W as much as possible to ensure that you can kill the enemy."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, His y can allow him to juke as well as initiate ganks with ease. This is especially effective when he has his Sweeper activated, or the enemy team has no vision set-up.\n\nHe unlocks his true power when he gets his Ultimate n. It can easily allow him to crowd control unsuspecting targets and set his team up for success and follow up crowd control.\n\nHe excels at extended trades due to how his k and s works. This enables him to duel enemies easily, especially if they are overextended."}
{"text": "As jax, In the last game, continue to divide the push if your team is not at risk of dying or getting caught. If your team is going to get caught or if the game is not one way, you have to group with your team to help them fight. Play on the side of the card that has the next major goal up so that you can turn to take it with your team. Otherwise, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the card and use it to get it to your team."}
{"text": "As shen, Hold the push when your Ultimate R is in place. Keep a constant eye on your allies and be ready to throw your Ultimate R on them if necessary. Look for peaks during the mid-game with your E. Catching someone out of position could lead your team to pick up a lot of free gold. Peel for your litters in mid-game team fights. If they die, you won't win the fight. Peel and keep them alive as long as possible."}
{"text": "Against leona, Avoid fighting in areas like the jungle or around the Dragon / Baron pit as this will allow Leona to get a really good Ultimate e off. Try to stretch and fight in a way if possible. When you fight, try not to group too closely as it will give Leona a really good Ultimate e and stun several people. Separate yourself so that she can only CC 1 or 2 people at best. Leona is prone to poke and disengagement. As soon as she tries to engage, try to disengage and create a distance between you and her."}
{"text": "Against sett, Sett is a very early Jungler game. Unless you are stronger than him, avoid fighting it in a 1v1 scenario. You can reduce Sett's ability to get good ganks out by placing desks around his jungle entrances and in the river. When Sett is level 6, his ability to get ganks out increases because his Ultimate R is a great ganking tool."}
{"text": "As brand, In the last game, Brand will be close to full construction. This is a significant power peak for the brand as its damage release should be incredibly high. However, it must make sure that it is not caught in the last game or otherwise it has no damage. At level 16, Brand can put the third and final point in its Ultimate R. It will be able to deposit a lot of damage on the enemies grouped in the late game team fights. Note that while you will have a lot of damage, the enemy team should have started building defensive elements to counter your abilities. Try to blow up targets that are squishy or lack defensive statistics."}
{"text": "As lux, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in lane. You have a lot of poke, so try to poke the enemy down as often as you can.\n\nPlay safe for the first few levels while you land poke on the enemy with your l. Once they\u2019re low enough, you can commit to an all-in.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve hit level 6 and purchased key component items, look to harass and constantly push the enemy into their tower. This will allow you to earn turret plating and increase your gold income. "}
{"text": "As karma, Poke the enemy as much as possible with your Q to get them low. Use your early lane dominance to gain a health advantage over the enemy.\n\nFocus on farming and poking during the laning phase. You shouldn\u2019t really commit to fighting the enemy.\n\nAt level 6, Karma doesn\u2019t gain access to an Ultimate a like most champions. If you\u2019re playing against someone with a strong all-in, play safe whenever their Ultimate a is up."}
{"text": "As pantheon, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As urgot, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping when your Ultimate R is down.\n\nGroup with your team when your Ultimate R is up. Rotate from the side lane to wherever your team is and look for a pick with your Ultimate R.\n\nPeel for your allies in team fights. As you\u2019re a tank, you\u2019re rather weak unless your carries are alive. Thus, keeping them alive is key in team fights. Be prepared to peel for them when necessary. "}
{"text": "Against nautilus, Nautilus is strong at levels 1-3 and can play aggressive and look for kills with his g. Ensure you\u2019re always behind a minion whenever his g is up to reduce his ability to kill you in lane.\n\nAs soon as Nautilus hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate e, his kill pressure will increase again and he can lock you down as soon as you overextend. Play less aggressive when his Ultimate e is up. \n\nNautilus spikes once he has Mobility Boots as it will help him roam really easily. Ping as soon as he goes missing so your allies know he\u2019s missing."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah has good pressure in early play. Make sure to place the vision in the river or at its jungle entrances to spot it before it is able to get a gank off. Post 6, Taliyah can gank from afar thanks to its Ultimate R. Try to place the vision in its jungle whenever its Ultimate R is in place. Taliyah does not have incredible control Dragon or Rift Herald in early play."}
{"text": "As zilean, At level 11, Zilean will be very hard to deal with.His Ultimate will keep him or a key target alive and will make assassins' lives a living nightmare.\n\nAt level 9, his Q will be maxed out and will allow him to deal tons of damage with a single bomb. It helps a lot when executing his Q > W > Q combo.\n\nZilean's damage and utility in any given fight are non-questionable. He can speed his allies out of trouble, revive them, or use them as a Q transport mechanism. Similarly, he can slow enemies, CC them, and allow his team to collapse on them.         "}
{"text": "As shen, Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs. As you are not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}
{"text": "As trundle, Trundle is quite decent during the late game as he will have his items and be highly tanky. His damage output should be pretty high as well.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate n will allow Trundle to take over fights way easily. He can quickly become tankier or deal more damage depending on which enemy he uses the Ultimate n on.\n\nTrundle is perfect during team fights. It will allow him to quickly blow up squishy enemies and slow their escape/advances. His e and e should help his team and him a lot."}
{"text": "As rumble, The effectiveness of Rumble's is greatly diminished when its passive is not half filled. The enemy can try to exchange freely with him during this point. He is rather squishy and vulnerable when his r is on cooling. This also applies when his weapons are overheated, which provides an opening for the enemy to all of him. Due to his immobility, a freeze can completely ruin his laning phase. This will make him inclined to ganks and will not allow him at all to CS."}
{"text": "As garen, Its passive allows it to stay on the track even after taking a lot of damage from poke / all-damage from the enemy team. This can also lure the enemy team into wasting a lot of valuable call spells. Its E allows it to do more damage in 1 v 1s (as the damage is increased if the enemy is alone). This allows it to do a lot of damage with a complete rotation of its capabilities, and unlike Garen, the enemy has probably failed to regenerate much health and stay in the way. It is really good by flanking the enemy team with its Qs and E. Moreover, its tenacity W will allow it to get out of the enemy team if it decides to dive and disturb them."}
{"text": "As qiyana, During the fighting, use the fog of the war to get closer to your enemy and then use your Ultimate R at the right time to completely dismantle the enemy team. If the enemy team is heavy on CC, you will want to make sure that you do nothing rash and stack the tenacity when you get the chance. This will allow you to do much more in the fighting. Neutral Objective combats should be easy enough to manage if you use your Ultimate R correctly. It is on a very short cooling time, so you will be able to use it quite frequently."}
{"text": "As reksai, Concentrate them with your other front-line champions. As you are the Jungler, you must make sure that you are still alive in the late match. If you will die before a major goal scares, the enemy will be able to take it. Make sure that you are still on the side of the map that the next major goal is safe. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free."}
{"text": "Against sejuani, Sejuani is very good at picking people off with her Ultimate R at the start of the fight. Make sure no one is too far forward especially the carries to make it harder for her to get a pick.\n\nAvoid splitting up when playing against a Sejuani. If you are not grouping, she will just force a fight with her Ultimate R, so make sure you\u2019re grouped as a team.\n\nPoke, disengage and CC will reduce Sejuani\u2019s ability to fight. If possible, try to harass and poke her down from afar to make it incredibly difficult to use her Q and engage."}
{"text": "As veigar, Focus on farming and getting as much gold and XP as possible. You need time and gold before you\u2019re able to come online and deal damage.\n\nYour champion is incredibly weak in the early game. Focus on farming and avoid fighting with the enemy until you\u2019ve got an item behind you.\n\nAfter your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. Do not fight anyone unless you have an advantage over them. Continue to get XP and gold."}
{"text": "As leblanc, LeBlanc's first power spike is at level two. Her Q, W combo should be enough to chunk the enemy laner's health bar.\n\nHer next power spike is at level three when she gets access to her E. Combined with her initial Q, W combo, and Ignite, she can quite literally kill someone at level three.\n\nGetting her Ultimate R is Leblanc's next significant power spike. She can now roam and repeat her W, R, W combo to kill her laner."}
{"text": "As gwen, If they invade you early, right back. It's especially true if they are early, because you won't win early fights with them. Be proactive with your Ultimate. Force the ganks with your R! As they will often glove in early play, you need to make sure that you also look at gank as often as you can and abuse your E. Focus on securing these goals. You need to take Rift Heralds and Drakes when you can!"}
{"text": "As lux, Very still and can be killed almost immediately if she is caught without her g. Layered CC will make her absolutely useless. She is somewhat the dependent element, so camping and killing her a lot during the early game will just make her a shield boot during the late match. She can be easily chosen by the enemy team if she wanders too far from her team, or when she tries to take the Blue Buff. She will also be very weak against the complete all-in of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As maokai, In the middle of the game, your main goal will be to look for as many choices as possible. Working with your Jungler to help them invade while planting your E tree in Jungle's brushes. You should be really tanky during this phase of the game. Peeling for your carts should be your main goal after successfully launching team fights. The river and bottlenecks would be a great place to fight because your abilities will lock several enemies. Just enter on the highest priority target and try to lock them up from CC."}
{"text": "As ahri, Thanks to AhriS E, it has great selection potential throughout the stages of the game. The good times to look for aggressive games are when the ADC enemy uses their dash or the Support enemy walks towards you. In team fighting, your mobility is absolutely great. With your Ultimate, you are able to flank the enemy on the side, get a murder and then escape before anyone is able to catch you."}
{"text": "Against talon, Place the vision on the walls and around its jungle entrances to spot Talon before he can jump on a wall with his E and gank a track. Talon has a good potential for invasion and can 1v1 most Junglers. Make sure your team has a good vision of him at all times. If he invades you, step back unless you have a clear advantage. Talon does not have incredible control Dragon or Rift Herald in early play. If you can, try to take these goals before he is able to get help from a nearby track."}
{"text": "As fiora, When no team fights are occurring, split push and draw the enemies attention to you while your team sieges or makes plays on the other side of the map.\n\nIn team fights, try to flank from the side to make it harder for the enemy to disengage or poke you down. If you get poked down, you wont be able to engage and will probably die.\n\nFiora is a strong skirmisher. Look to fight whoever tries to stop you from split pushing. You should be able to fight anyone as long as you\u2019re not behind in the mid-game."}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz has a lot of potential out of play with his E. Increased mobility allows him to get up to the enemy quickly, avoid incoming damage and escape ganks easily. At level 6, Fizz gains access to his Ultimate R which is an excellent tool at all stages of the game. He inflicts a lot of damage and has a great radius. Fizz is a murderer and can remove the squishy champions easily. He is incredibly strong in the middle of the game if he can get choices."}
{"text": "As zoe, Go for the all-in at level 2 to gain a huge health lead.\n\nIf she uses her Ultimate aggressively and misses her R, all-in her and jump on her.\n\nGo for extended trades as often as possible as you win all of them.\n\nKeep the wave closer pre 6 if possible so you can run her down.\n"}
{"text": "As karma, Karma early game poke is really obnoxious, especially for laners who are melee in nature. She can use her Q to both poke and wave clear simultaneously, which allows her to get lane priority, and her Jungler can safely invade the enemy as a result.\n\nThe first component offers a lot of poke from Karma's end as it increases the damage of her Q and allows her to use it frequently as she will have more mana to use.\n\nLevel 6 isn't a huge spike, but it definitely increases the amount of poke damage she can deal with her abilities. Her empowered Q is a force to reckon with once she hits level 6."}
{"text": "As aphelios, The different weapon combinations available to you make you a very versatile ADC who can adapt to nearly any given situation (provided you don't fall back massively in the game).\n\nThe AoE damage on your Infernum UltimateRas well as the potential to CC an entire enemy team with your Gravitum Ultimate Rmakes you really good during team fights (especially in closed and clumped fights).\n\nYou excel in extended trades with slight variations depending on your weapon combination. Combined with the sustenance from items and your Severum, you can easily turn the tide of a fight if you manage to survive the enemy's attempt to kill you at the start of a fight."}
{"text": "Against rakan, At level 1, play respectfully. If he takes W at level 1, he may look for an early engage and force you to blow your Flash. He tends to do this against utility Supports when they walk forward to harass.\n\nPlay towards the opposite side of the lane at all times. This will make it harder for Rakan to get a successful engage on to you or your carry.\n\nIf Rakan misses his W, you should try to abuse the cooldown and play aggressive. Getting him low will make it incredibly hard for him to use his W for the second time."}
{"text": "As shen, You will want to beat it remotely when possible. This will help you to cut Shen. After six, you will want to bait Shen for an all-in. Once this is done, use your Ult and blow it up. Always play near your tentacles when possible. This will prevent Shen from regularly looking for all-in on you. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy has no sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As veigar, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for a pick with your n to gain the numbers advantage. Then use your Ultimate R to take them down quickly before looking to siege or take a nearby objective.\n\nAt this stage of the game, you should have tons of stacks and be really strong. If you\u2019re ahead, use your Ultimate R to stat check the squishiest enemy champion to take them out of the fight."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Another point in his Ultimate a will increase his dueling potential and allow him to be a looming threat all around the map.\n\nHe will have multip items during this phase of the game. This means he will deal a lot of damage to the enemy, and squishies will have a hard time against him.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This means overall increased damage and chasing potential.        "}
{"text": "As xayah, Avoid going for extended trades with Xayah early on. She will usually win them.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early on. It will protect you and make the matchup a bit safer.\n\nFocus on poking and harassing her with your Q and W early on. When fighting, take care and be on the lookout for her E.\n\nAt level 6, she has higher kill pressure than you, and she can turn around fights.\n"}
{"text": "As shen, Beware of his CC as much as possible in this matchup. Do not do so can easily make you tease and kill. If he leaves the track, or if he goes out, look to push hard and get down Shen's tower. Additional gold will always help your team. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy has no kind of sifting potential and can be easily exposed to the ganks. Shen must be thrown out before looking for an all-in. This way, even if he gets to all of you, he will die."}
{"text": "As taric, Taric\u2019s first major power spike is when he hits level 6. He can look for aggressive plays such as dives or risky skirmishes when he has his Ultimate R up.\n\nTaric can look for disgustingly aggressive plays if he invades, camps in bushes and tries to abuse the enemy Jungler.\n\nWhen he purchases his first component item, Taric\u2019s aggression and overall tanky stacks will improve heavily. Expect him to go for more aggressive plays when he has picked up this item.\n"}
{"text": "As varus, Focus on the bottom of the opposition with your Q and W. It should be easy enough for you once you slow down with your E. You are very still so it should be important for you to take some countermeasures against the ganks. Ward around the track and keep the wave on your side whenever possible. Close a lot and get your basic items quickly. This will help you get killed and bursting enemies with your heinous Q damage."}
{"text": "Against talon, When teams come together, make sure to keep your flanks to spot Talon before he can jump over the wall and assassinate your team. As soon as Talon engages, try your hardest to break it out before he is able to disengage and do a lot of damage. Since Talon is a murderer, expect him to look for peaks with his Ultimate R. Avoid walking around the Rift of Invocators alone. Do not walk in the non-paid areas of the map if you know that Talon is nearby."}
{"text": "As tristana, It will have a lot of articles during the end of the game, which will allow it to blow squishies up and inflict a lot of damage to the grouped enemies. It will also allow it to take more minor damage due to the theft of life. A full-maximum Out Ultimate R will allow Tristana to resume the game very quickly. The ability will be on a short cooldown that allows her to use it both aggressively and defensively when she wants it. All her abilities will be maximized now, which means she will be able to use her W to reposition frequently and inflict massive amounts of damage to her enemies simultaneously."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, Malzahar will be a real threat when he hits level 6. You need to watch your positioning and not walk too far forward just in case he uses his Ultimate R to catch you out of position.\n\nDestroy Malzahar\u2019s shield whenever possible. It offers him a lot of protection and getting rid of it forces him to play safer.\n\nFocus Malzhaar in this matchup. He is weak early and will die quickly if you focus him first. "}
{"text": "Against sion, Sion\u2019s level 1 and 2 is pretty strong if he is trying to cheese the lane. If he isn\u2019t going to cheese, then he won\u2019t be strong early.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Sion will become. Depending on his build path, he will peak at different items.\n\nAt level 6, Sion gains access to his Ultimate R. His kill pressure and roam potential increases a lot from here on out."}
{"text": "As viego, Viegos Passive is only as strong as the composition of the enemy team. If the team is chosen from a team that lacks damage, turning into them could be unrivalled. Viego is a tough champion to master: in particular, playing around your Passive and your R can be quite difficult for beginners. Viego has little utility and his W cannot help him overcome the walls. It is a disadvantage compared to the other mobile champions in the current meta."}
{"text": "As riven, Riven will start falling off as the game goes on, so she will have to accumulate a lead early on. She should rely on picks to win the game.\n\nShe will have many items during this phase of the game, which will let her dish out a lot of damage if she manages to catch an enemy.\n\nLevel 16 is a massive power spike, which means that she can completely decimate enemies who are clumped together. She will need to find flanks on the enemy frequently."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, level 3 is a decent powerspike as Heimerdinger will have access to all his abilities. He can easily CC immobile ADC and burst them down with his turrets and rockets. He may also use the lane brushes to catch enemies off guard with his W or E.\n\nLevel 6 is arguably a massive power spike for Heimerdinger. He can now bait enemies to their deaths with ease. He can also take towers very quickly or slow multiple enemies with his E.\n\nThe first mythic item will allow Heimerdinger to dish out a ton of poke damage in the lane with his turrets. His burst damage will be pretty potent as well, and he can one-shot enemies with utmost ease."}
{"text": "As neeko, Level six is an important peak for Neeko as it gains access to its Ultimate R power. Team fighting will become really easy now. Its early play is pretty decent because it can get the enemies out of the range. Its E will be empowered if it can properly manipulate the minion wave. The first component will allow it to spam capabilities and not lack mana. It will also allow it to do a lot of damage in the way."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac will look to ganker more frequently when their Ultimate is up. Make sure to keep the enemy's jungle entrances so your team can spot the Jungler leaving their jungle with their Ultimate. Make sure to place the neighborhoods at your jungle entrances so you can spot them before they jump over you. The neighborhoods and river districts at your jungle entrances are the key to counter Zac. Beware of Zac's early play pressure. They are much stronger than you and will try to make games to make themselves and their teammates before. Use your superior goal-taking ability to make plays and take goals such as the Dragon or Rift Herald."}
{"text": "As nasus, Incredibly weak early game. This means he needs to play safe and avoid trading until he\u2019s got quite a few levels under his belt.\n\nHas a lot of poor matchups. In the current meta, he will struggle to lane against a lot of enemy champions.\n\nRelies heavily on the late game to win. As games end around or before the 30-minute mark, his late-game carry potential is lessened."}
{"text": "As vex, At level 11, Vex will put a second point in her Ultimate R. She will be much more of a threat at this stage of the game. In the middle of the game, the teams will begin to regroup. Vex is good in team fighting and she will be a great threat."}
{"text": "Against twistedfate, Once Twisted Fate has his components for his first item, he will be able to push pretty easily with his s and d. Stand outside of the minion wave so he is unable to push and poke you at the same time.\n\nWhenever Twisted Fate\u2019s d is on cooldown, you should look to abuse him and go for a trade. If he picks a Blue Card, you could go in for a trade. Avoid trading when he has Gold Card primed.\n\nAt level 6, Twisted Fate\u2019s kill pressure doesn\u2019t increase, but his ability to roam does. Make sure you ping as soon as he goes missing and try to match his wave clear so he is unable to push you into your tower."}
{"text": "Against jayce, Jayce has the advantage of the range so that he will be able to poke and harass any champion of melee. Keep this in mind at level 1 and 2 so he does not poke you down. Jayce, w s or sw combo is very good to push and bring you down. Stand behind the wave minion so they block the damage of his s. Don, not stand near the wave as his s is AOE. It is very good in team fights."}
{"text": "As talon, Talon has the largest number of first bloods in the game. His early death pressure is crazy! Talon has a great potential for roaming thanks to his E. This allows him to jump over the walls and move on the map quickly. In the later parts of the game, Talon can collect additional deaths on enemies who walk on the card alone. As he deals a lot of damage bursting, he can kill them quickly before running to security."}
{"text": "As vladimir, If your allies move to your lane after destroying their tower, rotate and move around the map to continue farming and gaining XP and gold.\n\nUse your abilities to clear the minion waves quickly so your team can siege/ prevent a siege from the enemy team.

{"text": "As swain, Swain's Level 3 is a massive power peak because it can now go for the all-in with a large amount of burst damage. Concealing its position in the track brushes should give it the element of surprise as well. Level 6 is another significant power peak. It can now all-in an entire enemy team and inflicts a lot of AoE damage. It is very useful during neutral objective combats and team fighting joined. The first element will give it a massive increase in burst damage. This is vital and will lead to Swain taking the game quickly. It can use the track brushes to kill enemy targets solo with ease."}
{"text": "Against urgot, Don't fight with Urgot at level 1 as he will have all his shotgun knees ready and he can quickly bring your life to zero if he can proc them all.\n\nTry to dodge Urgot\u2019s Q and E in the laning phase. They both have long cooldowns and you should trade with him when they\u2019re down for a better chance of coming out ahead.\n\nTry to stay over 25% health at all times. This will increase your chances of winning lane and surviving. If you\u2019re lower than this, he can just use his E, auto once and then finish you off with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he goes in with his E, he can\u2019t get out due to his E being on a very high cooldown initially. \n\nIf his Passive is down, he can\u2019t play as aggressively due to the threat of him being killed. This is applicable for early to mid-game fights only.\n\nTeams with lots of CC and disengage tools are really good against Zac. He struggles to get onto targets, use his Ultimate R and make use of his Q when the enemy has escapes/ or CC.\n"}

{"text": "As leesin, You have a lot of presence during the early game. Gank every opportunity you get, especially on pushed-up enemy targets, to get a lead.\n\nEfficient clearing is necessary to ensure that you can gank frequently. Don't be a miser when it comes to using your abilities as your Energy regenerates quite quickly.\n\nWarding will be an essential part of your playstyle during this phase of the game. The most important thing you want to do is keep a Control Ward in your inventory to use your Ultimate k efficiently."}
{"text": "Against malphite, When you play as a varied support, try to use your range advantage to harass and push it down. A good time to harass it is when it walks forward in attempts to get the last shots for its pupil search. The Passive Malphites shield offers more safety in the way. Try to harass and harass it as often as possible so that it is unable to get the shield and protect itself."}

{"text": "As poppy, Very strong all-in potential with her E. This when combined with her Q slow, can allow her to lock down an enemy for quite some time.\n\nHer W is the bane of any champion with dashes, especially all the carries who are reliant on their dashes.\n\nHer Ultimate R can allow her to turn the tide of a fight almost immediately as it can turn a 5 v 5 into a 5 v 2 easily. It also acts as a great source of disengage for her."}
{"text": "Against rengar, At level 1, Rengar may try to cheese you to get an early health lead. You can reduce his all-in potential by waiting for him to show before walking forward. \n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map so Rengar cannot jump out of the bushes and trade with you. Furthermore, stick towards the bottom side of the lane at all times to make it harder for him to jump on you.\n\nOnce Rengar hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, he may look for the all-in. Alternatively, if he is unable to kill you, he may push the wave and try to roam with his Ultimate R. If he leaves lane post 6, make sure you ping that he\u2019s gone to reduce the chances of him getting a successful Ultimate R off. "}
{"text": "As monkeyking, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. Post 6, avoid fighting them at any cost because they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will kill you easily. A good player will play around their Ultimate as often as he comes. You have to counter their waste pressure by doing the same thing."}
{"text": "Against shen, Take care that Shen has a good ambush potential in the middle of the game thanks to his E. Do not go to the hall or walk in unrewarded parts of the card if you know that Shen has been nearby because it can cause your death. If Shen uses his Ultimate R and leaves his ADC alone in the way, try to kill them because he will not be able to protect them if he is elsewhere on the map. However, you could cancel his Ultimate R if you think he will be able to spin the exchange. Try poke and harass Shen before a team fight starts. If he is weak, he will find it very difficult for him to peel and protect his litters."}
{"text": "As bard, During the middle of the game, Bard's abilities will be on a lower cooldown. His Q will be on a rather short cooldown, which will allow him to look for more peaks throughout this stage of the game. Unfortunately, while most of the peak champions at level 11, Bard is not really one of them. Although his Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown, it will not inflict any damage and will most likely be used to get peaks or save his allies. Bard should have picked up a lot of Meeps now. His passive and empowered self-attacks will be very useful at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 9, Darius would\u2019ve maxed out his e. His all-in potential and kill pressure is still very good during the mid-game.\n\nAt level 11, Darius will put a secondary point in his Ultimate e. If he gained a slight lead in the early game, he will be tough to handle in the mid-game, and he should be able to kill any enemy who tries to prevent him from split pushing.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Darius should\u2019ve completed a couple of items. He should be able to deal a lot of damage to targets, and also be somewhat tanky. The items he picks up makes him a huge problem during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As pyke, Pyke is a very mobile champion thanks to his W and E. This allows him to escape sticky situations quite easily. Pyke-Ultimate R is an execution that can be a valuable asset in team fighting that you can kill the enemy when they are somewhat healthy. Even when behind, Pyke can still be very useful in team fighting as long as he can execute an enemy."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille has good outplay potential with her E and Ultimate R. She can often outplay the enemy and turn around or escape exchanges with ease.\n\nShe is a challenging champion that is quite fun and rewarding. Players who put a lot of effort into learning her will reap the rewards of a veteran Camille player.\n\nAs her Ultimate R is a CC tool, using it on a squishy target generally results in a kill. You can snowball a lead through constant ganks this way.\n"}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo may not join team fights as he isn\u2019t very good in them. He may instead be split pushing and trying to take objectives in the side lanes. Make sure someone is able to stop him from splitting.\n\nTeemo will place Mushrooms t around objectives and in high traffic areas. Avoid going anywhere that Teemo has recently been in without a Sweeping Lens. He and his teammates may be ready and waiting and try and pounce on you.\n\nAs Teemo will be split pushing or away from his team during fights, you could use the numbers advantage to force a fight 4v4 or 5v4. Just keep an eye on him and be prepared to rotate if he gets close to your tower."}
{"text": "As ekko, As Ekko is a champion in the middle, he will be harassed by the top range of other mediums. He must not let them bully down otherwise he will fall into gold and XP. Common flank points can easily be monitored by the enemy team, reducing Ekko's flank potential. Ekko will have to spend some time cleaning the pupils if he wants to succeed in pulling enemy champions. Ekko is subject to CC. If he is hit by CC in layers, it will be difficult for him to inflict damage, use his W or escape combat with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As rengar, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nLook for picks in the later stages of the game. If you can pick someone off, you should be able to rotate to the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nKeep a constant eye on which major objective is spawning next. Do not split push or go on the opposite side of the map when a major objective is up or about to spawn."}
{"text": "As lulu, Level 3 is a massive peak of power that Lulu has access to all its capabilities. It can either go for all the complete damage on the enemy or work on the defense of its ADC as needed. Level 6 is a massive peak of power. It will now annoy the enemy by completely denying the assassination and breaking out the attempts of the end of the enemy. The first element will surely help Lulu to get out a lot of the way. It can spame its capabilities frequently due to the increased regeneration of the mana while simultaneously reducing the cooling of its spells."}
{"text": "As swain, Excellent CC channel if he or someone else in his team gets to CC a target. This works especially well against motionless door. Can regenerate a lot of health with his W and thus surpass his enemies in the way. Its Ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective when fighting in closed spaces. He can use his W to set up ganks for his Jungler too. This allows him to catch up with his target while providing a vision of the area. This last part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Once Ornn unlocks his Ultimate R, he will have an easier time in the way. He will be able to search for murders and even put his Jungler in place once he has it at his disposal. Expects that he will play a more aggressive position 6. Every time Ornn gets an element upgrade, he will be much stronger than every single upgrade offers him additional statistics. Ornn is good in team fights. Try to fight when he's not there because he will make team fights much easier."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Very vulnerable when his E is down. This can allow the enemy to cover him and kill him quite easily during the early match. His ultimate positioning R can have him killed if his team does not follow him. Moreover, going too deep without any help can also have him killed. It is completely useless if the enemy manages to steal his camps and question him in terms of articles. This will prevent him from doing damage and will make him a dead weight for his team."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Whenever he has 3 Towers Q up, he is always going to be a threat.\n \nAt level 6, when Heimerdinger unlocks his Ultimate R, he basically gets 3 new abilities. Take care when trying to fight him as he might just use any one of his abilities to trade with you.\n \nLevel 3, 6, 11, & 16 are Heimerdinger\u2019s major level spikes. Take care when he reaches those spikes as he may look to all-in you."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Kog\u2019Maw is rather weak in the early game. Play safe and avoid fighting until you have a few levels under your belt.\n\nAvoid fighting in the early game. Instead, focus on farming and gaining as much gold and XP as possible. Once you have a few levels behind you, you can start to fight.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve destroyed the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower down to open up the map."}
{"text": "As yasuo, After your bot lane has rotated to the mid lane, move to the side lane and start farming and gaining XP there. You can look to 1v1 any enemy who tries to stop you.\n\nLook for frequent trades with the enemy throughout the laning phase. Getting an early kill could snowball the lane heavily in your favour.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, look to play more aggressive. Your Ultimate R is a great skirmishing tool and you can get early kills with it."}
{"text": "Against kayn, When Kayn gets his transformation, he'll be much stronger. If he goes Red Kayn, he'll be more tankier, if he goes Blue Kayn, he'll inflict tons of damage. At level 6, Kayn can be more aggressive and go for more risky pieces than he can use his Ultimate R to protect him from death. Keep this in mind during his struggle. Kayn will seek to sniff as much as he can in early play so that he can get his form early."}
{"text": "As drmundo, As the game advances and he gets his core items, he will be able to deal damage, as well as, soak up a lot of damage for his team as a frontline. This enables his backline to deal damage freely.\n\nHe can be a good initiator with his Q and R. His Ultimate R prevents him from dying or getting burst down quickly.\n\nHe is at his strongest when he is with his team as he will get a lot of follow up damage and will be able to help his team get kills. This is really effective when fighting for neutral objectives as he can easily zone out the enemy champions from the objective."}
{"text": "Against anivia, Anivia needs to invest in the mana early so she can grow easily. You can take advantage of it by using your early advantage to earn jobs and get a health lead. Every time Anivia has her Passive Up, her ability to survive all-in is much higher. Try to look for frequent jobs while her egg is down, and call for help when needed. Anivia comes online when she has unlocked her Ultimate m because it allows her to grow much more efficiently. She will have much more track presence once her Ultimate m is unlocked and she will start looking for jobs."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Focus on farming in the early game. You need to earn as much gold as possible to be a major threat later on.\n\nYou\u2019re going to naturally push the minion wave with your Turrets Q. While you\u2019re pushing, keep a constant eye on the map. Heimer is vulnerable to ganks if he doesn\u2019t have 3 Turrets Q up, so keep this in mind.\n\nIf the enemy laner roams, don\u2019t bother trying to contest their roam. Instead, push the minion wave and start earning turret plate gold."}
{"text": "As viego, Once you get your core item, you should look to duel the enemy as much as possible. If the enemy is playing too safe, roam to some other lane.\n\nHelping your jungle should be really easy for you due to your E. Don't waste any time going to objective fights, as you may be able to get a huge lead there.\n\nYour W will play a pivotal role during this phase of the game. Always make sure that you land it on a high-priority target, as it can help you secure picks quickly."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, Avoid cheating goals like the Baron or the Dragon in the middle of the game if Kog. Maw is alive and close. It can easily get you down and force you to the goal and it will make you die or waste a lot of time. In team fights, try to lock Kog. Maw as fast as you can. This will reduce his ability to inflict a lot of damage with his e and self-attacks. Positioning is the key to Kog. If he malpositions or walks too far to harass and poke with his y, make sure that you capitalize on it and shoot him."}
{"text": "Against lux, Always make sure you\u2019re stood behind at least 2 minions so she is unable to root you with her g.\n\nIf Lux uses her g and it misses, use the cooldown of this ability to play aggressive as she will be unable to protect herself and prevent the all-in.\n\nMitigate Lux\u2019s l effectiveness by standing behind and not inside the minion wave. This will make her choose between using her l to poke with or to push with."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Keep an eye on your position as champions as well as his. If you keep your eye out of the ball for 1 second, Cho-Gath can end up hitting you with his e or m. Cho-Gath has a lot of support thanks to his passive that restores health. Watch to trade frequently or he will suffer all the damage you inflict on him. Cho-Gath will get a lot of support through his liabilities and the items he buys. Try to match his support starting with Corrupting Potion and buy items like Morello or Executioner."}
{"text": "As nidalee, Nidalee is really good at countering juggling and stealing camps away from the enemy Jungler. This allows him to move forward while putting the enemy behind. Has good objective control. This allows him to secure the Dragon with ease. It can also take the Rift Herald alone and fast! Nidalee is a strong and duellist skirmisher. This makes him a pain to manage for the enemy. As long as it can avoid CC (or wait for the enemy to use a key capability first) and land its s, it should win most of the 1v1s."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Level 6 is a massive peak since it can now hit the team fights as a whole. It can also look for flanks and dive the enemy backline. Its early play will be quite solid as it can simply go for coherent all-in-one jobs and return to safety due to its y. It will not take much damage with the proper use of this ability, but it will have to stay out of sight. It is a good skirmisher early, especially when it gets its Ultimate *R*."}
{"text": "Against ekko, Lock Ekko in the team fights will prevent him from using his Ultimate R to escape with. Keep track of his Ultimate R in the fights as he can use it to organize an escape or engage. Keep the vision in typical flank locations like Ekko will try to set up a engagement with his W of out of sight. If you see him running towards you, step back for a few seconds as he would have used his W. When no team fights occur, Ekko will seek to divide the thrust. Avoid leaving him alone in a side lane by making sure that there is always someone who fits him."}
{"text": "As karthus, You will be able to blow up the squishes with your Ultimate e with ease now. Even if they do not die, they will be too big to participate in a team fight. You will be able to burn through the entire enemy team with an appropriate positioning. Your 1 combined with your n will be able to shoot enemy squishes. Use this strategy during neutral and objective battles. Remember that your placement can make or break an entire team. Place it well and fog of war so that the enemy team does not anticipate it and take the necessary precautions in advance."}
{"text": "Against gragas, If you play as a varied support, try to intimidate and harass Gragas as often as you can. But don't force him as he has a lot of burst damage. Gragas can tease a commitment when his Body Slam E is standing. Try to stand behind or near the minions at any time. However, don't stand too close to them since the ability has an AOE and if you're close to them, you'll be hit by his E. If Gragas uses his W, it, because he wants to do something like set up his Jungler or go for an exchange. Play safer for a short period of time when he uses his W."}
{"text": "As kalista, Really great skirmisher due to how her Passive and r work. She can quite easily run an enemy down while kiting them with ease. All she needs to do is avoid getting CC\u2019d.\n\nWhile taking objectives, the chances of her team losing the objective fight are very low. This is due to Kalista\u2019s r combined with her Jungler\u2019s Smite. In short, she excels at taking objectives quickly and securely.\n\nShe can save her Support with her Ultimate x if they happen to overextend in the lane. The ultimate can also be used to initiate crucial fights, especially when the enemy team is clumped up, or is fighting in closed spaces."}
{"text": "As malphite, It is weak early because its presence is negligible, and it cannot do much against the various champions. All it has to do is to maintain its health until it reaches level six. Once it reaches level six, its presence will skyrocket, becoming a major threat to the enemy lantern. Working with the Jungler allies will help it massively. The first element will allow it to spam its abilities quite frequently. It will also allow it to inflict more damage, especially when it has its Ultimate h."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As galio, You can even use the Allied champions who rely on the dive of the enemy team to secure a massive strike at the heart of the enemy team. Making the fighting unfair for the enemy team should be your main goal. It is not necessary to kill an enemy, but to exterminate them is also a viable stratum. So, if you put in place a deathbrush and manage to catch someone, do not commit and die instead."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is difficult to play into ranged champions. They can constantly harass and bully her which will make it difficult for her to survive the early game.\n\nYour Q will only be as impactful as you make it. If you use your Q without multiple stacks, the damage will be futile.\n\nHer W doesn\u2019t block tower shots, but it does increase her defensive stats. With this in mind, always think twice before committing to tower dives."}
{"text": "As tristana, The enemy can try to get away from her to prevent her from getting her E completely loaded, which has not managed to reset her to facilitate an escape. Her E without her Q is completely ineffective during the early match because she has no form of external attack speed on her. If she uses it negligently, the enemy can look for a commitment on her. She is completely useless if she falls behind during the early match. She is dependent on the articles and without them, the game could also be a 5 v 4 due to her inefficiency in the game."}
{"text": "As neeko, This is especially true if it goes for AD construction. Can't be very effective if the enemy puts the right vision around and can notice Neeko changing its shapes or hiding in a brush to land its E. Due to its thrust power, it can be very sensitive to ganks especially after using its W."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, His level eleven isn't too good since it doesn't give him a lot of stats. The Ultimate e in itself will be handy, though, and Tryndamere can use the lane brushes to catch the enemy by surprise.\n\nTryndamere is really good at split pushing due to his kit. It allows him to 1 v 1 targets with ease while also ensuring that he can escape in time should the enemy team decide to collapse on him.\n\nHe can pretty much duel any enemy during this stage of the game. This is quite a boon as he can make multiple enemies come to him while his team gets objectives."}
{"text": "As malphite, Can absorb a lot of damage for his team with his passive. This allows him to be a first line for his team while also being able to escape death when he enters with his **Ultimate**. After six, he can set up several ganks for his track as well as other tracks with his **Ultimate**. It is very beneficial if the track he isganking has a certain form of CC built in their kit. He is the jerk of all immobilizers, especially the various immobilizers. He can quite easily climb on them and prevent them from doing anything in a fight. If Malphite goes AP, there is no enemy to carry for most of the game."}
{"text": "As darius, Keep the minion wave close to your side of the track. This reduces its ability to push you into the way and prevents it from moving away from the farm. Be prepared to sacrifice CS for XP and health against Darius. Only the last minons hit what you can without losing health. It is not worth extending, on greedy for a few minions when it can just shoot you with E and start a fight. Do not go for prolonged trades with Darius period. It is incredibly strong thanks to its Passive that makes 1v1 duels extremely difficult for you. Keep the trades short and soft when necessary. Hit levels 2 and 3 at the same time as Darius. It has a very strong all at these levels and if you are below level relative to it- it could look for for for the fight. Hit level 2 (the first 7 minons) at the same time as it to reduce its chances of trading."}
{"text": "Against tristana, If Tristana uses her W aggressively, overturned her or CC she is unable to reposition herself and clean up the fight. Bringing her down early will make it really difficult for her team to win the fight. In the middle of the match, if Tristana is in advance, avoid walking too far if you are alone. She has a lot of all-in-one and choose thanks to her W and E. Stay at an appropriate distance from her so she can't easily get you off. Tristana has a lot to peel with her W and Ultimate R. To facilitate the fight, try to play around her Ultimate R or try to flank her in team fights. This will make her more difficult kite/escape from the fight."}
{"text": "As samira, Try and stick with your Support throughout the mid-game. You\u2019re quite vulnerable and easy to kill if you\u2019re on your own. By staying with your Support, your survivability will increase.\n\nContinue picking up farm in the side lanes when no team fights are occurring, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to dish out damage in fights.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As aatrox, In the later parts of the game, stay with your team and look for picks. Avoid separating or being too far from them as the enemy can force a fight while you are nowhere near. Play around your ultimate R and avoid committing to fight while it is on cooldown. If you fight while it is on cooldown, you will miss a lot of additional healing and damage, which can make the difference in a late team fight. In team fights, flank the enemy to make it easier to access the enemy rear line. Positioning away from your team but close enough to join the fight could give the enemy a false sense of security, making it seem that the fight is 4v5: forcing them to expand."}
{"text": "As karthus, He gets a significant peak of power at level 11 because of his access to his level two Ultimate e. Damage is significantly increased, mainly if he managed to buy some items with it. At level 9, his 1 will be maximized. Anyone taken by Karthus will take a large piece of damage and probably die even if they are isolated by Karthus. Karthus can control much of the track during the middle of the game and choose enemies with his varied abilities. He can even slow down enemies with his wall, allowing his team to collapse and initiate fighting."}
{"text": "Against olaf, Olaf doesn't have the healthy light early. If you have a strong duel potential: a little equal to Olafs, you should look to invade him and try to kill him while he is weak. He has good Dragon control thanks to his passive and t. Make sure to take the lower side Crab Scuttle and keep the Drake guarded so you can spot him in case he tries to take it. Olaf will look for gank often in early play. Having a vision around the river and jungle entrances will reduce his ability to get successful ganks."}
{"text": "As malphite, He will have his core items by now, which means that his d and Ultimate h should hit like a truck right now.\n\nMultiple points in his Ultimate h will allow him to use the ability frequently, make picks, and land multi-man Ultimate h on enemies fighting near choke points.\n\nMalphite is quite good during team fights. He can damage many enemies at once and do so from out of vision, giving the enemy a tiny window to react.        "}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton will seek to divide the thrust when no team fight occurs. Make sure that someone who can challenge him prevents him from pushing. Do not send someone who is unable to beat him to prevent him from pushing. For his e to be effective, he will have to get as close as possible to the enemy in a team fight. With this in mind, Renekton will probably try to flank in a team fight rather than run towards you. Make sure that your flanks are monitored so that you can spot him before he has the chance to engage."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie\u2019s best power spike in lane is once she unlocks Tibbers R. She can look for aggressive picks and Flash plays with Tibbers and her stun.\n\nAnnie will always be a little bit strong when she has her stun ready or almost ready. If the enemy looks to fight you while you have max stacks, you can quickly turn around the fight.\n\nOnce Annie has completed her first component item, her wave clear and trading power increases. In particular, her Q and W will make trades go more in her favour."}
{"text": "As gwen, As a result, she will easily win any duel, provided she has not dropped drastically at the beginning or middle of the game. Gwen excels during team fighting because she can dry up a lot of damage, especially when she fights around rough areas. Her W allows her to mitigate a lot of damage, and her E allows her to reposition herself quite quickly. Gwen makes misleadingly high amounts of damage during this phase of the game due to her articles. She will also have maximized most of her abilities. She can spam her abilities, which translates directly into more damage and healing for her."}
{"text": "As nocturne, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. A good player will play around their Ultimate as often as it comes. You have to counter their deganking pressure by doing the same thing. He will beganking much sooner. Make sure to apply as much pressure as you can to match his first ganks."}

{"text": "As hecarim, It can easily be killed if it enters without its Ultimate t and gets CC.d by the enemy team. This will allow the enemy carried kite gate and kill it while the enemy tanks keep it away from their portages. The enemy can completely counter it if they play in open spaces like the way and are properly spaced when Hecarim enters. This will prevent Hecarim from fearing the whole team and will allow the enemy team to retaliate. Hecarim is not able to flank the enemy freely if the enemy team puts a good vision around the way they fight. This will force Hecarim to engage on the enemy team in a direct way, which will allow the enemy team to react accordingly."}

Respect her damage output once Tibbers R is primed and ready.\n\nAnnie is clearly stronger when her stun is ready, and when she has 3 stacks on her Passive. Whenever she has her stun ready, you need to respect her damage output and her ability to trade with you.\n\nAnnie is strong during the mid-game and in team fights (if she can get a multi-person stun). If possible, do not walk around the map alone and without your team. Stick to warded areas and try to stay away from her at all times."}

{"text": "As chogath, If you can't hit your e or m on a target when they fight alone, you'll almost always lose the skirmish as you need to land these abilities to interrupt the enemy. When you're behind, it's really hard for you to get back into the game that the enemy can invade you over and over again."}
{"text": "As alistar, When playing Yuumi against Alistar, keep in mind that jumping from your ADC when it has its CC tools can be risky. Wait for Alistar to use or miss its Q before launching. The best moments to get off your ADC and harass Alistar are when it has wasted its Q. You can jump from your ADC and hit it with a few cars while it is down. Make sure to communicate with your team by pinging when Alistar errs. When it does, it is a good opportunity to get off your ADC and try to harass the ADC enemy with your auto-attacks. To reduce the risk of all in, try to position the minion wave closer to your turret. This can make it harder for Alistar to engage with your ADC and can give you more time to react."}
{"text": "As sylas, Sylas is quite strong during the mid-game, especially if he gets a solid ultimate from the enemy team. His life steal will prevent him from dying quickly during significant fights.\n\nTwo points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take enemy ultimates quickly and will increase their effectiveness as a whole. It can be highly beneficial in team fights.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give him a massive damage boost and allow him to blow up single targets with ease.        "}
{"text": "As ezreal, Once you have destroyed the tower, move in another way and try to take this goal too. Try to harass and poke the enemy as often as you can with your Q. Using your capabilities will often allow you to stack your Linge as quickly as possible."}
{"text": "As ksante, Your **W** is great versus burst because it reduces incoming damage.\n\nK\u2019Sante has a lot of CC and can lock down and layer CC on enemy champions.\n\nLots of trading potential with his **Q** and basic attacks. He can also run down enemies and kill them thanks to how much CC he has in his kit.\n"}
{"text": "As xinzhao, If he can pull a single shot at the person he is aiming for, he will be controlled almost immediately by the crowd and killed on the spot. Unbelievably vulnerable once his Ultimate R is about to cool down. The enemy team should seek to fight him during this time and target him in front of anyone else. Not very effective against a group of champions because he is extremely dependent on the peaks to get a lead. Moreover, the crowd controlling him can allow the enemy team to get rid of him quite easily."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Try to wander and get murders in different parts of the map. Your C damage and global breakup will help you a lot. Fighting near the bottlenecks should help you a lot during this phase of the game. You might be able to get a C knockup multi-man and squishes breath up easily."}
{"text": "As senna, The second point of its Ultimate R will allow it to inflict increased damage to the enemies while protecting the allies. It is perfect during team fighting. Its playing environment is solid. It can quickly 1 v 1 non-mobile enemy, and it can also do extremely well in team fighting due to its W. The first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will allow it to inflict a lot of damage and heal for massive quantities according to its articles."}
{"text": "As twitch, His Ultimate c allows him to shred the enemy team if he finds that they are grouped closely. This makes Twitch very good in bottlenecks. He can use his s to spot for his team. If he is ahead, he can even flank and blow you up completely when he activates his e. Twitch has tons of burst damage when he left AP. In an extended trade, he can easily kill someone if he is able to attack them automatically for free."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is not powerful early, so she has to use her Q to her full potential in the way. This will give her a lot of support and damage, but she will have to invest a little time in stacking it. Gwen's Level 6 is an important pick-up for her. She can quickly run the enemies now that the amount of healing she gets from the output of capacity damage is quite powerful. She should win a duel with ease from now. Getting the first component will surely help Gwen's laning phase a lot. Its release of damage will increase, which will let her go to short burst operations on her enemy with her E and Q. She will later be able to use her W to escape."}
{"text": "As quinn, Once again, Quinn does not really point to level 16 as his Ultimate R is a utility tool rather than a tool of pure damage. Quinn starts to fall into the later parts of the game as the enemies will buy items that offer them additional protection against his damage. Fortunately, the more Quinn articles gets, more than one problem it will be for the enemy team. As long as she is looking for choices with her team, she should agree in the end of the game."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, Seraphim players will often use their authorized Q (or Q) to push the minion wave. By standing outside the wave, she will be unable to poke and push the wave at the same time. Keep an eye on the number of batteries she has. If she has 3, play safer than her next ability will be much stronger. Once she has reached level 6, expect her to look for killers in the way or install her Jungler for ganks. Her Ultimate R is a strong tool that offers her pressure to kill extra."}
{"text": "As ashe, Your immobility is the clearest weakness you have, both during the laning phase as well as the team combat phase. This puts the extra task of making sure that you are well positioned during the fighting as an error can cause you to kill. The enemy team will look to you gank several times during the laning phase to get you back. Although this does not affect your utility, you will not be able to get enough elements to impact the fighting later on what will cost your team multiple fights and goals."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in its Ultimate R. As long as it can get the channel out, it will be very good in the late part. The teams will continue to group in the late part. This will allow the Fiddlesticks to get a good amount of damage to the entire enemy team. While you are good in the late part, you are incredibly squishy. Lookout and be careful trying to get a good Ultimate Roff so that you don't get killed before a fight breaks out."}
{"text": "As fizz, When Fizz puts a second point in his Ultimate R at level 11, it will be incredibly scary to play against it because his Ultimate R will be on a cooldown low and inflict a lot of damage. Fizz will maximize his first ability at level 9. His death pressure and escarment power will be quite high level 9. Thanks to his cooldowns and the general state of the game, during the middle of the game, he will be able to assassinate and get choices on weak-health enemies as they walk around Rift Summoners alone."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lissandra is really good in team fighting because you can flank the enemy on the side with your E. She has an incredible gank set up throughout the laning phase thanks to her W and R. This makes her a formidable opponent against the squissy champions. Your wave is incredibly strong and you can erase the waves quickly. You can then use your lane priority to wander with ease."}
{"text": "As diana, Diana is really good in team fights because her Ultimate R is a great AOE tool. She is really good in team fights. Diana is 1v1 potential throughout the game is very high. She can 1v1 most enemy Junglers to win an early advance. Maybe one of the best flankers in the game. She can pull out the enemy rear line almost instantly during a team fight if she is left unchecked."}
{"text": "Against fiora, Fiora's Passive can make a huge difference when trading with her. If you\u2019re unhappy with the area marked, walking back a certain distance will reset the position. \n \nPlaying around Fiora's W is a focal point of the lane. Try baiting it out before you all in her to prevent her from neglecting your CC.\n \nKeeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map will make it very hard for her to chase you down and kill you in lane. If you push and she freezes, you will be very vulnerable to ganks and all-ins from Fiora."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Once it is level 3, it gets its first major power peak and can easily force a flash. Expect this and play respectfully. Once Renekton is level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate t, it can be really aggressive and kill you. If you are weak, remember and avoid pushing the wave if it is ahead as it can all within you while you are overheard. After Renekton has finished his first article, his death pressure also increases. Avoid trading or fooling unless you are ahead."}
{"text": "As leesin, If Lee Sin falls behind in the early game, he will struggle in the later parts of the game.\n\nLee Sin is vulnerable to hard engage and CC. If the enemy has lots of CC, you will need to play around their CC tools if you want to perform any cool manoeuvres with your Ultimate k.\n\nWhen ganking your allies, if you miss your e , you have nothing to offer and will have to retreat. Make sure you get close to the enemy before using your e , or use your e before your e  to get close to the enemy."}
{"text": "As zeri, Make sure you have mid-priority at any time in this game. It will allow you to turn and help your teammates very easily. Your loaded attacks are your bread and butter in this matchup. Always try to erase the wave with your Q while you save your self-attack for the enemy. Since you are so mobile, you can feel that you can chase enemies down. Try not to do it without any form of Hast ability, as your E has massive cooling early."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss out on a lot of potential kill pressure.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, 3 points in his Ultimate e will not be an excellent power spike. This is because it only ensures his prolonged survivability and nothing else.\n\nHe will be dealing a lot of damage during the later parts of the game. This is since he will have multiple items and will be able to duel anyone.\n\nHis late-game scaling is phenomenal, and he can one-shot squishy enemies after slowing them down and catching up to them. It will give him a pivotal role in the game."}
{"text": "As camille, Stay with your team in the late game. Avoid running too far with them as the enemy can force a fight and win the game if you are nowhere near. In the late game team fights, try to peel for your carts if they are fed so you can protect them and keep them alive. If you are ahead, look to remove the enemy Mid laner or ADC. Flank in the team fights to make it easier for you to get on key targets with your W. Make sure you keep flancing otherwise you will be high and forced to retire."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia's Ultimate R is an excellent tool in team fights. Struggle 5 champions at a time is a sure way to win the team fight. She inflicts a lot of damage in the prolonged trades as long as she lands her Q. She has to make sure she keeps an eye on her mana pool although she does not run to mana. Cassiopeia can often get early murders in the way with a level 2 all-in. Getting an early murder will make the laning phase much easier for her."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Level six is when Nocturne ends up becoming a global threat to the enemy team. He can easily roam around and get free kills.\n\nHis early game laning is quite strong.

{"text": "Against belveth, In team fights, try to lock her down quickly so she is unable to auto-attack and dish out tons of damage.\n\nWhen she activates her E in a team fight, avoid using any burst abilities.

{"text": "As soraka, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety.

Try to keep your ADC or main carry alive for as long as possible."}
{"text": "As xerath, Very motionless and sensitive to the control of the crowd of the enemy team, especially when it loads its p up. Can easily be all-in-one if it uses its r with caution and it does not have its Flash up. Can be flanked with ease when it is pushed up in the track due to its in-build wavollelar. Its Ultimate 2 can easily be interrupted and can be used as a traction to target it and get rid of it immediately. Xerath will have to position well before using its Ultimate 2 , otherwise there is a good chance that it will get killed immediately."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 16, Ezreal will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will deal a lot of burst damage to anyone who is hit with it in the late game.\n\nWhen Ezreal is coming to completing his build, he will have incredibly low cooldowns on all of his abilities. This is good for him as he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight occurs. Also, his E will be on a short cooldown which allows him to escape skirmishes easily.\n\nEzreal is great in the mid-game, but he does start to fall of in the late game as it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}
{"text": "Against leona, Leona Level 2 is very strong. Make sure to hit Level 2 at the same time so you can chat with her incase she hires. Once Leona has Mobility Boots, she can wander with ease. As soon as she leaves the track, ping your teammates so they know she's missing. At Level 6, Leonas kills the pressure increases as she can use her Ultimate e from far away to lock you. Play respectfully and not push if you're without Flash."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce won't be spiking too hard at level 11 because it won't be giving him as much stats or utility as most other champions' ultimates. It will definitely allow him to increase his overall burst damage, though.\n\nOnce he maxes his s at level nine, he will be able to dish out a lot of damage. This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of war and manages to burst down an unsuspecting squishy enemy with his w > s combo. This can also be done from the lane brushes if the enemy doesn't ward them.\n\nJayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at that time. Due to his ranged stance, he can quickly go for short burst trades where Jayce is guaranteed to come out on top if he spaces well."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Be a part of neutral objective fights. Your Ultimate R will be especially helpful in pushing the enemy Jungler off the neutral objective.\n\nLook for picks with your Jungler when possible. It will allow you to accumulate a massive lead and will let you take over the game single-handedly.\n\nDo not forget to farm in the game as you still need your core items to win the game. If you manage to accumulate a lead, make sure that you push it harder and get other lanes ahead."}
{"text": "As renekton, Once Renekton gets two points in his Ultimate t, he will be able to run the enemies with ease. The best effect will be seen during the fights around the bottlenecks, however, as the enemies won't be able to escape easily. Renekton will have several articles now. This means that he will be inflicting a lot of damage to his enemies while simultaneously tanting a lot of damage. Any enemy who gets caught by him will undo himself and probably die. Renekton is decent in the middle of the game, but he should focus on the end of the game during this phase of the game itself. Taking as many team fights as possible and getting rid of the enemy rear line is his condition of victory."}
{"text": "Against zac, Zac\u2019s E can be used from afar to start the team fight. Make sure you ward your flanks when sieging an objective. \n\nAvoid fighting in the jungle as it will make it easier for Zac to land his E and knock up your whole team with his Ultimate R. Fight in the open when possible.\n\nDo not group too closely. If you\u2019re split up slightly, it will be impossible for Zac to catch out and knock up your whole team with his E and Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong will be unable to fight as a team if you can trap him before he has the chance to engage. Delay a team fight while you trap him as much as possible. Do not fight inside the jungle or around goals. You will usually be gathered together which will allow Wukong to get a great Ultimate noff."}
{"text": "As poppy, Her Q can easily be ruled out because it has a very short range. Can be easily killed if she overextends with her E. She also acts as a front line so that the enemy can flank her teammates before leaving for her. The misuse of her Ultimate R can land both her and her team in huge problems. It is especially true if the enemy team has a kind of heavy commitment that can get on her team."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton is an early game dominant champion. Expect him to play aggressive and go for kills.\n\nWhenever Renekton is above 50 Fury, his next ability will be empowered. Stay at max distance so he cannot get an empowered e or e off on you. Avoid fighting when he has tons of Fury too.\n\nDo not underestimate Renekton range with his Dash e. He can use it on the minion wave to close the gap and trade with you."}
{"text": "As xayah, Very motionless throughout the game and can be closed early. She is very inclined to ganks as well. Her E is a vital part of her kit. Once this ability is lowered, the enemy can everything in her with ease and ensure a murder on her. She is very vulnerable once her ultimate R is lowered. She can be concentrated by CC as well as the assassins at that time, so she is forced to play defensively while the Ultimate R is down."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, In team fighting, either use your Ultimate r on an enemy if you can kill them or use your Ultimate r on a fed ally to keep them alive longer. Peel for your allies in team fighting. As you are a tank, you are rather weak unless your aircraft carriers are alive. So keeping them alive is the key in team fighting. Be ready to peel for them if necessary."}
{"text": "As ahri, Beware of early all-ins. She is stronger than you early and can easily kill you if you over extend or get caught out of position.\n\nThis is a farming matchup. Focus on farming and just harassing with your abilities.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave at all times. They will be trying to push, and by standing out of the wave, you force them to choose between using mana on the wave or you.\n\nInvesting in early boots can help you dodge their skill shots and make the laning phase less stressful."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, He can keep the enemy pushed into their tower in the early game which allows him and his ADC to get early tower plates.\n\nHeimerdinger can often prevent ganks alone by having 3 turrets Q up as it is quite hard for a Jungler to gank when he is surrounded by them.\n\nHeimer has tons of poke throughout the laning phase with his Q and W. He also has good trading setup with his E too."}
{"text": "As ivern, Focus as often as possible on agriculture and ganking. This will help you move forward and help you advance your allies too. Look at the elementation supports early and be ready to adjust your items. There is no reason to buy the same items. One of Iverns' first assets is that it can fly camps. If you know where the enemy Jungler and one of their camps is about to spawn, you should try to steal it."}
{"text": "As vayne, Vayne will have the advantage of the range in the way in most matchups. She will be able to abuse the enemy and refuse them from the farm. Vayne scales incredibly well in the later parts of the game. As long as she is not behind, she will be really good in the end of the game. She is beautiful against the tank teams and tank champions, thanks to her s."}
{"text": "As jinx, Stay with your Support throughout the mid-game. If you move away from them, you will be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you\u2019re always near at least 1 ally.\n\nGroup and stay with your team at all times. Do not split push or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As shen, His E is quite short-range that makes it difficult for him to land this clear vision capability. This can hinder his all-in-hand potential. If he uses his W and Q with negligence, then he and his team will be in a really disadvantageous position, and will let themselves down quite easily. His Ultimate R has a very long cooldown and will force him to lose priority almost instantly."}
{"text": "As nami, This champion is quite motionless and is subject to CC. If they get caught by any CC, they will probably die. Less porting potential compared to many other Supports. Nami relies on her team to carry while she provides them with healings and shields. Nami is a squishy champion with low points of success. This makes her quite vulnerable and easy to kill."}
{"text": "Against ahri, Ahri is rather weak in early play. Look for the poke and fight during that time to get a good start from get-go. Post-6, Ahri has a lot of potential for pursuit thanks to her Ultimate. Do not stretch when you are weak as she can easily kill you and put you behind. Once Ahri has finished her first article, she will inflict a lot of damage and be able to push the wave/combat more frequently. Keep this in mind and respect her all-in damage."}
{"text": "As malzahar, When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Don't stay just in the middle if you can't get anything done. After your bot track moved to the middle track, turn to the bot side of the card or somewhere on the map so you can keep closing and winning XP. Play around your ultimate R in the middle of the game. It's an incredibly strong tool that can help you get an advantage of killing. With the advantage of numbers, you can then make the call for Baron or seat a round nearby."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin should finish the game by this point, as he will now start falling off. He will still be able to pick enemies off, though.\n\nOnce Lee Sin gets 3 points in his Ultimate k, he will disrupt enemy fights frequently and act as an asset to his team.\n\nLee Sin will have multiple items during this phase of the game. It will allow him to survive longer during his fights and let him play the role of the disruptor very effectively."}
{"text": "As jhin, During this phase of the game, work with your Jungler to get some picks by using your W to CC the enemy team.\n\nRiddle the enemy Jungle with your E traps. This will help you slow down the enemy team and detect them before major neutral fights.\n\nWhen using your Ultimate R, make sure that you are not too far away from your team. Failing to do so will probably get you killed by an enemy assassin."}
{"text": "Against diana, Diana has a unique playstyle when it comes to farming and trading during the early game. Her s has a strong impact on the wave and she will tend to push the wave with it. Try to engage and fight her when her s is on cooldown.\n\nDiana is dependent on landing her Q for the all-in. Try to back away if she lands it to reduce her chances to follow up with her t and trade.\n\nShe is a melee champion that struggles against ranged champions. When playing as a ranged champion, use your abilities and auto-attacks on her when she moves forward to last hit."}
{"text": "As xayah, Once she has 2 points in her Ultimate R, she will be able to burst down enemies quickly, and she will also be able to use it frequently to keep her safe.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will significantly boost her damage and will let her one-shot squishies if they are not careful about her E.\n\nXayah is really decent during team fights as she can dish out tons of consistent damage with her W and E. She just needs to position herself well.        "}
{"text": "Against karma, Depending on Karma\u2019s build path, she may spike earlier rather than later- and vice versa. \n\nKarma has a potent early game and is quite strong from levels 1 to 3. Try to not let her poke you too much by hiding in between the minion wave and backing off when she moves forward.\n\nRemember that Karma has her Ultimate a at level 1 and can dish out lots of damage if you\u2019re hit by her empowered Q."}
{"text": "As leblanc, This champion is mechanically- very difficult. You will need a lot of games to master this champion. They will lack mana quickly, so you must always keep an eye on your mana bar. If you are behind, you will do no harm in team fighting and you poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, Avoid fighting or staying close to your teammates (bundled together). As Nautilus\u2019s e can knock players up who come into contact with it, if you\u2019re close to the focused ally you might get hit too.\n\nNautilus will often be the frontliner for his team. Once he has gone in, try to focus him down if his teammates do not follow him in. Naut struggles getting out again once going in- so if he makes a mistake, abuse it\n\nNautilus will auto attack anybody who comes close to him in attempts to CC them with his Passive. Try and stay away and out of range during team fights if you\u2019re squishy."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas succeeds in reaching level 11, it will have two points in its Ultimate R. This means that it can initiate battles and move key enemy targets much more frequently. At level 9, Gragas will have its first maximum ability. This is really beneficial to it because the increase in damage will really help it to duel. This is especially true if Gragas goes for the complete AP construction. During the middle of the game, the enemy will be busy exchanging tracks and defining the vision. As Jungler, Gragas can easily use his Ultimate R to choose such enemies before significant fighting."}
{"text": "As teemo, Avoid lane brushes at all costs in this matchup. Teemo can easily Blind you from them and you won't be able to do anything about it.\n\nGet a Sweeper and keep clearing his traps in this matchup. This will help you significantly when it comes to fighting Teemo.\n\nYou must not fight Teemo in clumped spaced as his traps will make it really hard for you to do anything to him.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is really good during the late game. His abilities will hit like a truck due to his items. His Ultimate e will be pivotal to winning the game.\n\nOnce he gets 3 points in his Ultimate e, it will allow him to half-health squishy enemies easily. This means that anyone who is behind on the enemy team will suffer a lot.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Karthus would've maxed his 1 and his e. His damage output in team fights will be very high."}
{"text": "As malphite, Can absorb a lot of damage for his team with his Passive. This allows him to be a frontline for his team while also being able to escape from death when he goes in with his Ultimate h.\n\nPost-six, he can set up multiple ganks for both his lane as well as other lanes with his Ultimate h. This is highly beneficial if the lane he is ganking has some form of CC built in their kit.\n\nHe is the bane of all immobile carries, especially the ranged immobile ones. He can quite easily get on top of them and prevent them from doing anything in a fight. If Malphite goes AP, there won\u2019t be an enemy carry for most part of the game."}
{"text": "As sion, He is pretty weak before he hits level six. This is because he doesn't have much mobility, and enemies can easily walk away from him if they have a vision of him.\n\nPost-six, Sion gets a decent power spike as he gets a team fight impacting Ultimate R. It allows him to roam around and lane ganks other lanes as well.\n\nThe first item component will give a boost to his survivability and overall damage. He will be able to use his Q from the brushes to CC enemies and then follow it up with damage from the rest of his abilities.        "}
{"text": "As gangplank, His Passive allows him to come out on top of short trades which is quite advantageous for him. Due to how well Gangplank scales, his Passive damage is really helpful in keeping his enemies away from him.\n\nHis E can be set from weird angles that can catch the enemy off-guard and cause a lot of damage. This is really good if Gangplank has access to the lane brushes in order to conceal his E barrels.\n\nWith his Ultimate R, he can impact any part of the map immediately and can act as an enabling force for his laners/Jungler to all-in their counterpart and get a lead. Besides, the longer the game goes on, the greater is the scaling for Gangplank due to his r gold mechanic."}
{"text": "As gwen, Getting to level 3 will be quite important in this matchup so ask for a hard leash and quickly erase the Jungle. Once you are level 3, you can start to glove. Once your passive is stacked, you can look for fights with the enemy. Searching for skirmishes when your passive is stacked will increase your damage production and increase your chances of killing the enemy. In the first levels, play safe and avoid engaging in any duel. Your game early is rather weak, so you're probably going to lose jobs against an aggressive jungle."}
{"text": "Against volibear, Once Volibear reaches level 3, it can look for a favorable occupation when the 3 of its basic capabilities are on the rise. Expect that it plays aggressively at that time. At level 6 and whenever it has its Ultimate R up, you have to play more cautiously and avoid committing to fight when you are low. In particular, remember if you are low, under the tower and when it has its Ultimate R available. Once Volibear has finished its first article, its release of damage increases a lot."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao is incredibly strong at the beginning of the game thanks to his E and Q. He will win the largest number as long as he looks for favorable jobs around abilities. His Ultimate R is very effective against the members of the enemy team. This will force the enemy to come in the range of melee of him, which can be quite devastating for them."}
{"text": "As jhin, During this phase of the game, work with your Jungler to get choices by using your W to CC enemy team. Get rid of the enemy Jungle with your E traps. This will help you slow down the enemy team and detect them before major neutral fights. When using your Ultimate R, make sure you are not too far from your team."}

Matching her wave clear will reduce her ability to roam.\n\nTaliyah doesn\u2019t gain access to a damaging Ultimate R at level 6. If you\u2019re a champion with a strong Ultimate, try to abuse her weakness at this time.\n\nWhen trading with Taliyah, always keep behind at least 1 minion.

{"text": "As tahmkench, Take advantage of your range advantage and poke Tahm Kench whenever his Devour (W) ability is on cooldown. This allows you to harass him without the risk of being immediately devoured and removed from the fight. Be careful of Tahm Kench all-in-potential. It is best to stay attached to your ADC when his Devour (W) is available, as you can be an easy target for him to catch and disable. By keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map, it becomes more difficult for Tahm Kench to engage effectively on you. This denies him the space he needs to make aggressive games and increases your safety in the way. Tahm Kench is particularly strong at levels 1 and 2 and can seek to make aggressive games during this time. Keep this in mind and prioritize your safety to avoid falling victim to his early aggression."}

This is an excellent power spike for Yasuo as his damage output increases massively and his r tornado poke increases drastically.

This also acts as a counter to carries who have dashes and rely on kiting to win fights.\n\nHis e allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease.

Make sure you hit Level 2 at the same time as Pyke, as they are much stronger than you at Level 2 and hitting Level 2 before or at the same time you will have a better chance of fighting back.

If she holds her auto-auto-auto, wait for her to use it before going forward. Caitlyn will seek to push and take your turn earlier. Don't she have you down by sacrificing CS for health and XP.

Avoid going anywhere that Teemo has recently been in without a scanning lens. He and his teammates can be ready and wait and try to launch you. As Teemo will be cracked pushing or away from his team during the fights, you could use the advantage of numbers to force a 4v4 or 5v4 fight."}
{"text": "As ashe, Be mindful of your positioning when dismounted due to Ashe's W poke.\n\nAvoid going for extended trades; instead, aim to auto-attack and then remount quickly.\n\nAfter level 6, be cautious about dismounting when Ashe has her ultimate (R) available.\n\nKeep the wave close to your side as Ashe is squishy, making her vulnerable to ganks from your jungler."}
{"text": "As sion, Extremely susceptible to getting poked out by ranged laners. In team fights, he can be kited to death by any ranged carry which the enemy team has.\n\nIf the enemy is smart and sets vision in the lane brushes, he won\u2019t be able to rely on his Q to poke/start an all-in.\n\nHis maneuverability decreases while using his Ultimate R, making it hard for him to land it when the enemy is out in the open and has some form of dash or blink."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Keep a constant eye on your mana pool. Cassiopeia has short cooldowns (global) and it is easy to spam them. Expanded trades work in favor of Cassiopeia. Its damage accumulates so try to go for extended trades around your E. Play around your Ultimate R. It's a good all-in-one tool and good to configure/deny ganks. Make sure you approach the enemy to make sure you are able to land it."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen\u2019s lack of CC makes it possible for the enemy to kite him till he falls back or overextends and dies. Since he lacks any form of ranged engagement potential, he is really weak against ranged enemy champions.\n\nHe relies on flanking the enemy team from the sidelines. If the enemy team manages to set the proper vision, Garen\u2019s game plan will collapse and he will be useless especially if your team managed to set him behind early on.\n\nDue to him having multiple builds, Garen\u2019s effectiveness can vary from game to game. If he decides to go for the full AD build when his team lacks a frontline, he won\u2019t be able to do anything that game if he is set back. This should be a proper signal for the enemy Jungler/team to camp him when possible."}
{"text": "As morgana, Take care of its reach advantage and pay attention to its poke in the track. Attach its Q before attempting a commitment to avoid getting caught in its crowd control. Its level 6 is stronger, as it can counter your all-in with its ultimate."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax needs time to come online. While he can trade in the early game, it\u2019s better to get a few levels behind you before looking for a kill.\n\nBe prepared to scale if you\u2019re in a tough matchup so you do not fall behind and become useless in the later parts of the game.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in tough matchups. Jax will find it really hard to survive the laning phase if he is constantly pushing."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Cho=Gath is a monster as the game continues. It can easily eat an unexpected target that wanders through the Rift of Summoners alone. If you don't know where Cho=Gath is, don't walk through the isolated river or without vision. Cho=Gath=The abilities are crucial when it comes to winning the team fight. Do not group too close together so he is unable to land his e on your entire team. When he sips a goal like Baron or Dragon, don't start if Cho=Gath is alive. With his Ultimate t, he deals more damage than Smite, so it's better not to take the 50/50."}
{"text": "As drmundo, Play safely in the early game. Wait until you have some levels and element components under your belt before trying to fight. Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card in early play. If you push, the enemy will be able to start a fight or refuse to pick up the farm. Once you are level 6, play around your Ultimate R and look for aggressive games. Try to bring down the enemy with your Q before looking for an all-in."}
{"text": "As sett, You will want to get to level 3 quickly and use the fog of war for over-extended gank enemies. This will allow you to get a fast advance early that you can capitalize on later. Your W will be of paramount importance in this game. Make sure that you time it properly, as it can be the difference between a won and a lost fight. Always try to gank the pushed enemies but make sure that you are not on the opposite side of the map when a neutral goal is about to spawn. Otherwise, you will lose an easy goal."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, Kog\u2019Maw is weak in the early game. You can abuse this to get an early lead or blow his Summoner Spells.\n\nAt level 6, Kog\u2019Maw will have an easier time poking and trading thanks to his Ultimate y. Take care when trading with him, and try not to let him burst you down.\n\nKog\u2019Maw benefits from extended trades once he has a few points in his e. Do not go for extended trades with him unless you have an advantage."}
{"text": "As camille, In the Support role, she has great pick potential with her E and Ultimate. She can catch any enemy who overextends post 6.\n\nShe can constantly pick up kills in the lane with her Ultimate. If you can\u2019t get kills in lane, look to roam and help your allies instead.\n\nCamille can play aggressive from the get-go. She can get early kills, get picks and deal a lot of damage as the game goes along.\n"}
{"text": "As gragas, Your level 3 is a massive powerspike for Gragas as he can now look for full-blown all-ins on the enemy target. Positioning may cause some hindrance as his E can be interrupted by minions. Using the river brushes or his Flash should quickly solve the problem. \n \nGragas' level 6 is a significant power spike because he can now displace key enemy targets during a gank or all-in. It can let him pick off the enemy backline should he decide to go for the entire AP build. He can also work with his Jungler and pick off enemies with this ability.\n\nThe first mythic item will give him a devastating power spike. His ability to one-shot targets increases massively, and he will just have to time his combo correctly from now on."}
{"text": "As viktor, Abusing his weak early play to gain an advantage. After getting an upgrade, stand out of the wave to reduce his poke and wave thrust power. Bait his CC tool before entering for a trade or all-in. Be prepared to sacrifice CS for XP to stay safe and level in the way."}
{"text": "As kled, Kled's Passive is highly underestimated, but it will make all the difference in the game now. He can use it to absorb so much damage without risk of dying, and he can quickly get up if Skaarl runs away. Kled will have its construction almost finished now. This means that he will be tanky, as well as flattening heavy amounts of damage. Anyone getting caught by him will probably die. Since all his abilities will be maximized at this stage, Kled will be huge in the game. His ability to disrupt the ranks of enemy teams will be phenomenal, and he can easily peel for his wears as well."}
{"text": "As urgot, Divide the thrust during the middle of the game and try to secure the secondary goals. Avoid regrouping when your Ultimate R is down. Group with your team when your Ultimate R is up. Rotate from the side lane to where your team is and look for a choice with your Ultimate R. Peel for your allies in team fighting. As you are a tank, you are rather weak unless your aircraft carriers are alive. So keeping them alive is the key in team fighting. Be ready to peel for them when needed."}
{"text": "As akshan, At level 9, Akshan will maximize his Q. It's really important for Akshan as maxing his Q offers him a lot of extra damage. When Akshan puts the second point in his Ultimate at level 11, he will find it pretty easy to execute enemies. At this stage of the game, the teams will be grouped. Akshans w will be really good at this stage of the game because he can bring back a recently deceased ally."}
{"text": "Against nunu, When it comes to getting a goal like the Dragon or the Baron, never go for the 50/50. Due to Nunus Q, he will win every battle. Try to take the goal when he is dead or on the other side of the map. Nunu is rather still when it comes to team combat (once the fight has started). Lock him up with crowd control and kite him during the team fight so that he is unable to be the front line and climb to your portages. Do not tighten together when it comes to team combat. If you are close to each other, he will use his Snowball W to engage from afar and run in the enemy. If you are all close to each other - he could be able to mount a 5 person."}
{"text": "As kled, Once he gets two points in his Ultimate R, Kled can focus on the race of the enemies down and destroy them completely with his team. He can even score singular hits with her. At level 9, his first ability will be maximized. This will give him a boost of massive damage, and he will kill people in an instant. It will be quite the peak of power for him. Kled will have several elements in the middle of the game, which will make him a devastating force to manage."}
{"text": "Against lucian, Lucian\u2019s level 2 power spike is no joke. Make sure you hit level 2 at the same time as him to reduce his ability to all in you. Level 2 is the first wave followed by the next 3 melee minions on the second wave.\n\nAt level 6, Lucian has a lot more trading power thanks to his Ultimate R. Once he activates it, try to either reposition, disengage or lock him down with CC so he is unable to land every bullet on you.\n\nWhenever Lucian\u2019s E is up, he will be stronger as he can dodge skill shots and CC. If he uses this ability aggressively, use the cooldown of it to play aggressive and trade with him. "}
{"text": "Against jax, Jax\u2019s Ultimate t will give him increased defensive stats which will make ganking a little easier for him as he will be tankier and deal more damage. If you meet him in a 1v1, avoid fighting him when his Ultimate t is up. \n\nOnce Jax gets his first item, he becomes much harder to duel unless you have items that match his damage. Don't over commit to fighting him without a backup plan. \n\nAs the game goes along, Jax will get stronger and stronger. Keep an eye on him at all times as he will look to split push and take objectives quickly."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius can start ganking as soon as he hits level 3. He needs all of his basic abilities before he can start to gank.\n\nHis best early game power spike is when he hits level 6. His Ultimate e heavily increases his 1v1 and skirmishing power and he will be a huge threat at this time.\n\nAfter he has completed his first component item, Darius\u2019 trading and kill pressure further increases. He can 1v1 most enemy Junglers at this time."}
{"text": "As karma, It has excellent wave damage and splashing with its Q. This allows it to obtain the priority of the track and to help its other langers/Jungler when they contest the objectives. Its d allows it to protect everyone in its team. It also allows it to increase the speed of movement of the allied team, which can help them catch an overcrowded enemy. When it fights 1 v 1, it has virtually no weakness when all its spells are lifted. If someone tries to approach it, it can just Q them and escape, If she engages, she can use her d and Ultimate has both the ability to disengage and regain a great deal of health. Her Ultimate is the backbone of her strength in the way and an appropriate use will allow her to move forward."}
{"text": "As talon, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. Post 6, avoid fighting them at any cost because they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will kill you easily. It will be ruined much sooner. Make sure to apply as much pressure as you can to match its first ganks."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven can easily 1v1 any champion at level 3 if she is in a favorable matchup. Do not overextend to reduce her chances of killing you. When Riven unlocks her Ultimate e, her all-out potential increases considerably. Make sure to disengage if she tries to fight you unless you have an advantage. Once Riven has finished two or three items, she becomes very strong and will be able to remove any squishy champion who is not a tank. If you see her running towards you-just back."}
{"text": "Against trundle, Trundle is a duellist and will look to trade early. At levels 2 and 3, it can look for a whole while you are low enough. Play cautiously when low and do not overextend if it has its Pillar e. If you are a reservoir, Trundles level 6 all-in can be deadly as it reduces your defensive statistics to a crispy one. When trading, be careful around the level 6 brand as it can look for an all-in. Depending on what builds way the Trundle went for, it goes peak at different times. Keep this in mind and always look to see what item he bought and play accordingly."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Stay together with your team. Do not leave the side of your carts otherwise, the enemy will capitalize on the fact and leave them defenceless. Peel for your carts in the team fights. After using your g, retreat and protect your allies and focus on the nearest champion. Look for choices with your Ultimate e. If you can catch someone when the enemy is not organized, you can force a team fight or a goal afterwards."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo becomes really powerful once it reaches level 16. This means that its Ultimate R will inflict massive amounts of damage in a short period of time. Moreso, the short cooling time will allow Yasuo to deal regularly with tanks. Yasuo will have a pile of articles completed during this phase of the game. This means that Yasuo will decimate the enemy due to its passive damage and r. It can almost a blow of squishies with ease. Thanks to all its completed articles, and its ability to quickly break down and drill through the armors of the tanks, Yasuo will be able to make a plethora of damage in a short period of time. The enemy team could as well at this time if Yasuo manages to advance."}
{"text": "As sion, Just hide in the lane brushes and wait for the enemies to show up close to the brush that you're hiding in. Your Q will easily take care of them if the brush is unwarded.\n\nAlways try to slow your enemies down by using your E on the minions in such a way that it hits the champion. Also, make sure that you use your W appropriately in this matchup.\n\nPost-six, look to lane gank your remaining allies. It will allow you to dish out a lot of damage and get your team a massive lead during the early game.        "}
{"text": "Against kalista, Extended trades will always favour Kalista thanks to her r. Try and avoid going for extending trades with her.\n\nKalista\u2019s first power spike is when she picks up her Berserker's Greaves as it will give her the first bit of attack speed she needs to snowball. \n\nOnce Kalista has completed Runaan\u2019s Hurricane, she will pump out a lot more damage and apply Rend r stacks really quickly."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, In team fights, don't stay too far ahead in case he tries to make a game. Watch your flanks! Pantheon can try to attack you on the side and go to your carts when his Ultimate R is on cooldown. Good time to fight is when Pantheon is divided push. Force a fight when he is on the opposite side of the map could be a good idea because it will take him time to get into the fight even with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against fiora, Fiora is extremely good at level 1. If she gets the right Vital procs, she can cheese an early first blood or leave you chugging your potions at your tower. Respect her all-in potential and do not fight her early on.\n \nWhen Fiora hits level 6 her duelling potential is fully realized. She can 1v1 almost anyone while her R is up. \n \nFiora is very good in the later stages of the laning phase and the mid-game. Respect her 1v1 potential and try not to die to her."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, When Fiddlesticks gets access to 3 capabilities, it's really hard to manage because they offer it so much utility. If you try to go for a whole in it, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing. Once Fiddlesticks has his Zhonyas Hurglass, it allows his Ultimate R to really hit at home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonyas, you can't attack him when he goes into the stasis. At level 6, Fiddlesticks ganks will become stronger and he's looking for gank constantly when he has his Ultimate Rup. Prepare for this and try to delay his peak of power for as long as possible through the invasion."}
{"text": "As rengar, Use the track brushes to your advantage and make sure that you keep the enemy lane all-in-the-hand frequently. This will allow you to be a threat and will allow you to deposit a lot of damage. Getting your Ultimate R will be a massive peak. You can now wander around and get killed in different ways to put you forward. Your ability to duel and detonate enemies is unsurpassed. If possible, consider the lane ganking route after the reminder."}
{"text": "As kennen, A very good initiator for his team with the ton of CC he brings to the table. In addition, he also has a reliable form of poke with his 1, which he can use to overthrow enemies. His Passive is what makes him so dangerous. It allows him to easily CC and take several enemies with his Ultimate m and h. This allows his team to follow him easily. He is a rough track, and his poke allows him to easily beat melee matches. He can easily use this fact to his advantage and throw a snowball from his track."}
{"text": "As draven, When Draven maximizes his g to level 9, his damage production will be incredibly high when trading with the enemy. It will also be on a shorter cooling that is useful if you have recently dropped an Axe g. Depending on the distance or behind Draven is, it can be very strong in the middle of the game or incredibly weak. It is vital that it does not overextend or get killed at the beginning of the fight to make sure that it can destroy as much damage as possible."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is good in team fights thanks to its AOE Ultimate R. Fortifying a fight or combat when Swain is nearby will make it easier for your team to win team fights. Avoid regrouping too closely around the goals or in team fights as it can allow Swain to land a very good multi-person E and start the team fight. Burst and poke is the best way to win a fight against Swain. Try to catch him before a team fight starts."}
{"text": "As camille, Stay with your team in the late game. Avoid running too far with them as the enemy can force a fight and win the game if you are nowhere near. In the late game team fights, try to peel for your carts if they are fed so you can protect them and keep them alive. If you are ahead, look to remove the enemy Mid laner or ADC. Flank in the team fights to make it easier for you to get on key targets with your W. Make sure you keep flancing otherwise you will be high and forced to retire."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 16, Ezreal will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will do a lot of damage to anyone touched with her in the last game. When Ezreal comes to the end of his construction, he will have incredibly low cooling on all his abilities. It's good for him because he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight happens. Moreover, his E will be on a short cooling that allows him to easily escape from the skirmishes. Ezreal is awesome in the middle of the game, but he starts to fall in the last game because it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana relies on her Jungler to secure objectives so she can get additional stats.\n\nWhen her Ultimate t is down, she is quite vulnerable and doesn\u2019t have any real disengage, although her a can help her escape a little.\n\nShe has so many counters in the top lane. It can be really difficult to play Shyvana in a lot of different matchups."}
{"text": "As ashe, In the late game, Ashe\u2019s y will be on an incredibly low cooldown which allows her to poke the enemy down a ton before a late game team fight erupts.\n\nAt level 16, Ashe will have 3 points in her Ultimate w. It will also be on a much lower cooldown (on a lower cooldown than the enemy will think). This allows her to get surprising picks to win the late game for her team.\n\nIn the later parts of the game, Ashe will be at max or near max build. Her damage output will be incredibly high if she can 1, poke the enemy with her y, 2 activate her Q and 3, kite in late game team fights."}
{"text": "Against yuumi, Yuumis R has a great field of effect. Do not look at the team struggle if its R is in the jungle or around a goal because it will be able to slow down many champions and heal its team. Try to fight it in open areas where your team is not grouped closely. Yuumis game style allows it to jump on any member of its team if they are nearby. If the enemy seems to be engaged, step back as soon as they play aggressively especially if Yuumi is attached to the front line as she will empower them. If Yuumi is in a bad position, try to kill her. She does not have mobility without her allies nearby and can therefore be punished very quickly."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Destroying his E barrels before he can detonate can take a lot of damage from his kit. It forms a major part of his early play damage and without it, it will just be blocked agriculture and sometimes help his team with his Ultimate R. His W is an important spell in his kit and it is very weak once this ability is in decline during the early game. It really gets prone to ganks when this ability is in decline and it can really escape without using convocator spells. Fighting in open spaces reduces the efficiency of Gangplank as it has won."}
{"text": "As syndra, Very immobile and can be collapsed on easily with multi-layered CC. Once CC\u2019d she is probably going to die with proper follow up.\n\nWithout her E, she is quite vulnerable and a susceptible gank target.

"}
{"text": "As swain, Very immobile and is weak during the early laning phase. This is especially true if he is facing a champion who can all-in and CC him.\n\nIs quite vulnerable when his E is down as it is his main form of CC. \n\nGrievous wounds can completely counter his kit during the early game and also affect his mid-game. He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he won\u2019t have the amplified healing and AoE damage."}
{"text": "As pyke, If you miss your Ultimate R, you\u2019re going to miss out on the potential resets and you\u2019ll definitely miss out on gold and damage. Try your hardest to know who has Flash and who doesn\u2019t to increase your chances of landing your Q.\n\nHe is a mechanically difficult champion to learn and will take a lot of getting used to. Expect to put in a lot of work trying to learn him.\n\nUnfortunately, Pyke has nothing to offer when his Q is down. Missing this ability will be devastating and you\u2019ll have to play safe until it\u2019s back up. Try to get as close to the enemy or bait out any dashes before using your Q."}
{"text": "As lucian, The level 2 of Lucian is a decent peak of power because it allows it to go for a devastating total combo. The damage inflicted is relatively high, and it can quite quickly kill the enemy with multiple combo rotations. Level 6 is a significant peak of power, especially when Lucian is against an immobile port. It should have an easy time to release waves with it as well if it has to remember. The first element will be a massive peak of power for Lucian because it allows it to do a lot of damage. It will give it an inherent advantage, especially if it can capitalize on its level 2 peak of power."}
{"text": "As sejuani, Her tankiness is exceptionally high during the mid-game. Her main job will be to ensure that she can get picks on squishy carries and kill them quickly.\n\nAnother point in her Ultimate R will decrease the cooldown of the ability. It will allow her to CC enemies quite frequently. It is pretty decent for picks around the map.\n\nSejuani is quite decent during team fights as she can absorb a lot of damage and has CC for days. She can peel for her carries pretty effectively as well.        "}
{"text": "As sona, Level six is a decent peak of power for Sona. It now allows it to CC targets, which can completely change the course of a team fight. Its first element will give it a massive boost in its healing. It will also get an additional mana regeneration that is always suitable for Sona. Level 3 is a small peak of power because it allows it to access all its capabilities at the same time. Now, it can also use its Passive to maximum potential."}
{"text": "As orianna, Orianna\u2019s Ultimate d can be game-changing and she can use it on up to 5 enemy champions. If she gets one good Ultimate d} off, it could turn the tide of the game.\n\nHas lots of utility. Her d can be a zoning tool, her d is a shield and her Ultimate d is CC. Not to mention her d is a speed up too!\n\nHer basic attacks deal a lot of damage and will let her bully and poke the enemy down incredibly hard.\n"}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Every time he has 3 Q laps up, he will always be a threat.

{"text": "As kayn, If they invade you early, just back off. This is especially true if they are ahead, as you will not win early fights with them\n\nBe proactive with your Ultimate, as they will look to use theirs whenever it is up.

You must take Rift Heralds and Drakes whenever you can!\n"}
{"text": "As sylas, His W can allow him to heal a lot of health in terrible situations. Being a point and a click, it is quite easy to land and can easily change the tide of a fight. The initial casting of his E allows him to move to a certain place. This can allow him to avoid hot skills and also to get on a still or vulnerable port."}

If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate R is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As soraka, Try and track Soraka's Ultimate cooldown post 6. It is important to do this as you don\u2019t want to be caught out by Soraka's superior damage post 6.\n\nEnsure that the minion wave is positioned nearer to your side of the map so your Jungler can gank your lane and easily kill Soraka.\n\nYour Ultimate makes you strong.

{"text": "As taric, His E is very telegraphed and can be dodged without a sweat. This makes it very hard for him to be an initiator of fights without his Flash.\n\nHis Q costs a lot of mana and will make him run out of mana if he is against a poke comp. This will force him to give up lane priority during the early game, which can sometimes mean an instant loss.\n\nHe focuses on enabling people with his Q, W, and Ultimate R. If everyone on his team is doing bad, there is nothing much that he can actually do to save the game."}
{"text": "As sona, Very squishy during the early game which makes her quite disposable and easy to set back. She can\u2019t do much if she gets camped in the lane.\n\nHas no form of priority in the lane during the early game as her Q does meager amounts of damage and her W is best not used until absolutely necessary.\n\nMissing her Ultimate R guarantees a team fight win for the enemy team and reduces Sona\u2019s usefulness by a huge amount. Improper usage of her Passive can yield the same results."}
{"text": "As lulu, You will have your core items now, and you will be able to bully your laner relentlessly. Hold onto your W for situations where you need to interrupt your laner. Carry on with your onslaught after that.\n\nUse the lane brushes to your advantage in the lane to catch enemies off-guard. The best time to all-in someone will be when one of their powerful spells (like a mobility spell) is down.\n\nAlways be prepared to help your Jungler if they decide to invade the enemy Jungle or take the Rift Herald. Your Ultimate R can actually save your Jungler if they get stuck in a bad situation.        "}

Flanking to achieve this increases her power.\n\nGreat AoE damage potential with her Ultimate R and W due to her completed items. Finding clumped fights and using her Ultimate R properly allows her to take over the game single-handedly.\n\nThe reduction in her Ultimate R cooldown makes it possible for her to have Tibbers up all the time. She doesn't need to worry about being caught out without her Ultimate R that frequently."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Always look at your positioning during the laning phase. Try and stay at maximum distance so it is more difficult for her to root with her E. This will also make it harder for her to get a good R Ultimate as she has to close the gap in order to stun you. Stand outside the minion wave at any time if possible. This will make it harder for Neeko to push you and poke you at the same time with her Q. Once Neeko has its Ultimate R, her death pressure will increase. Make sure to come back when she is low whenever she has her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As rammus, Rammus' early ganks are pretty decent if the enemy happens to be pushed up. He should be able to get his team quite ahead if he finds regular opportunities to do so.\n\nLevel six is a decent spike as it allows him to get access to his Ultimate 2. The ability will enable Rammus and his team to get a lot of kills during skirmishes.\n\nThe first item component will bolster his survivability and allow him to do constant DPS by being around enemies.

Your Ultimate R is an excellent scarring tool and you can get killed with it."}
{"text": "As pyke, Level 2 is a good spike for Pyke as he can immediately all-in the enemy. It will help him get quick kills if he manages to push and reach level 2 first.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as he can now execute champions with his Ultimate R. This means that he can quickly kill his laner or any other squishy with one rotation of his spells and his Ultimate R.\n\nBoots are a massive power spike that allows Pyke to roam around the map very quickly. He can easily help the mid-lane get ahead and come back to the bot lane in a jiffy.        "}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Try to team fight in the open so he is unable to use his empowered E to stun your whole team. Do not fight inside the jungle as the size of his E is roughly the same as the jungle.\n \nOnce Heimerdinger hits level 6, he technically unlocks 3 new abilities. Be careful when trying to initiate a skirmish with him as he might just pull out his magic card and kill you.\n \nJust like during the laning phase, you\u2019ll want to destroy Heimerdingers Turrets Q as quickly as you can before a team fight is underway so he is unable to dish out tons of damage."}
{"text": "As sion, In team combat, it can be put into a kit to death by any transport range that the enemy team has. If the enemy is intelligent and puts the vision in the track brushes, he will not be able to count on his Q to poke/start an all-in-one. Its handling decreases while using its Ultimate R, which makes it difficult for him to land when the enemy is out in the open and has some form of dash or flash."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is hard to play in a variety of champions. They can constantly harass and intimidate him which will make him difficult to survive the early game. Your Q will only be as impacted as you do. If you use your Q without multiple piles, the damage will be futile. His W does not block turn shots, but it increases his defensive stats."}
{"text": "As riven, Very mobile with her e and t which allows her to get out of sticky situations with ease. This makes her a menace for the enemy backline.\n\nHer Ultimate e can allow her to execute low health champions easily. This becomes really valuable during a teamfight.\n\nShe has her own form of CC on her r which when combined with her dashes can allow her to land a multi-man stun. This will allow her teammates to follow-up on the all-in."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he goes in with his E, he can\u2019t get out due to his E being on a very high cooldown initially.\n\nIf his Passive is down, he can\u2019t play as aggressively due to the threat of him being killed. This is applicable for early to mid-game fights only.\n\nIf the enemy avoids staying close to the walls, then it will become really hard for Zac to all-in them from the fog of war. He will then have to take conventional gank paths."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille can\u2019t really start trading too well until level 4. Once has unlocks all of her abilities and has multiple points in her Q, she can start to trade.\n\nCamille\u2019s next power spike in lane is when she unlocks her Ultimate R. It offers her a lot of kill pressure and is good for setting up her Jungler. If you can\u2019t make use of it in your own lane, you could roam with it to help your allies.\n\nOnce Camille has completed her first component item, her ability to trade with the enemy will intensify. Don\u2019t be afraid to look for more fights after your pick up your first item."}
{"text": "As masteryi, If you want to fight him, you need to bait out his Q first or else he will just win the 1v1.\n\nPost 6, don\u2019t steal his Ultimate as it will not help you too well in the 1v1 against him.\n\nHe is a stronger early game Jungler than you. Try to equal his pressure in anyway possible (stealing camps, counter ganking or taking objectives).\n\nInvesting in early armor can be really helpful versus Master Yi!"}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia\u2019s Ultimate R is a great tool in team fights. Hitting 5 champions at once is a sure-fire way of winning the team fight.\n\nShe deals a lot of damage in extended trades as long as she lands her Q. She needs to make sure she keeps an eye on her mana pool though so she doesn\u2019t run out of mana.\n\nCassiopeia can often get early kills in lane with a level 2 all-in. Getting an early kill will make the laning phase much easier for her."}

If you get caught out or the enemy initiates a fight while you\u2019re not there, the enemy will win the team fight.\n\nPoke and delay team fights while you and your team harass the enemy and get them low.

This can be game-changing for the enemy team and will allow the enemy to easily win a fight.\n\nShe is quite weak against ranged carries, especially if the carry has some form of dash or range advantage over her, as it will allow them to easily dodge her E.\n\nBuying early Grievous wounds against her can allow her enemies to win a lot of early game fights against her. This advantage will carry over to the late game where she won\u2019t be able to heal up a lot and will be easier to take down if she decides to all-in the enemy."}
{"text": "Against sivir, Sivir will be left with her Support in the mid lane at times. If your team is in a position to do so, you could collapse on her and the Support and then force an objective like the Dragon or Baron with the numbers advantage.\n\nGroup as a team and avoid splitting up too much. Sivir\u2019s Ultimate R is a great tool to initiate team fights and if she\u2019s able to collapse on a target who\u2019s alone or overextended.\n\nIn team fights, make sure you can bait out or play around Sivir\u2019s Spell Shield E. If you\u2019re able to play around it, killing her will be soo much easier."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Use your early play advantage to push the wave regularly and get additional turn and gold plates. Use your Q to quickly push the wave and hit the enemy at the same time. After getting the first turn in the track, turn to the medium track and take more turret plates or get the outer tower. This will open the map and increase your chances of winning. Consume your Passive Headshot on the enemy laner(s) as often as possible. This will help you win trades and skirmishes with the enemy."}

{"text": "As darius, When there is no team fight, look to divide the thrust and try to fight the enemy who is trying to stop you. Darius is a strong 1v1 champion and can fight most of the sledgers who are put up against him. Look to use your Ultimate e at the last possible second of each fight. Resetting to your Ultimate e will increase your chances of winning the fight. When you fight team, look to peel out and focus the nearest enemy champion. You are Darius, not a murderer and you will fight to kill anyone alone."}
{"text": "As shen, Split push when your Ultimate R is up.

Peel and keep them alive for as long as possible."}
{"text": "As braum, A very important peak of power when it reaches level two. That's because it can easily all-in enemies unsuspectingly with its Q and W with some help from its track partner. Another peak of power is at level three because it has access to all its abilities and can now all-in and play defensively that the game requires it to play. Its mitigation of damage is very powerful and provides immunity against projectiles that otherwise would pass before it. Major peak of power on getting its Ultimate r as it can now disrupt whole team fighting and can easily choose enemies in the enemy Jungle."}
{"text": "As syndra, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in lane. You have a lot of poke, so try to poke the enemy down as often as you can.\n\nPlay safe for the first few levels while you land poke on the enemy with your Q. Once they\u2019re low enough, you can commit to an all-in.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve hit level 6 and purchased key component items, look to harass and constantly push the enemy into their tower. This will allow you to earn turret plating and increase your gold income. "}
{"text": "As nasus, Needs time to come online. He is weak early on and cannot really gank unless he has easy kills set up for him.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have the greatest objective control. He will need his allies to help him secure the Drake and Rift Herald.\n\nRelies heavily on the late game to win. As games end around or before the 30-minute mark, his late-game carry potential is lessened."}
{"text": "Against gnar, Gnar can easily escape from the ganks with his E. Try and bait this ability before your Jungler gets in your way to reduce his chances of escaping. Do not commit to using your Ignite spells or brilliance if Gnar is about to change shapes like Mega Gnar gives him additional health that will allow him to survive. As he is a varied champion, it is important that you do not let him down and harass you with basic attacks. Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP if you are weak."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Yasuo is really strong once he has 100% crit chance. Thanks to his Passive, he can get to this stage quite quickly.\n\nOnce Yasuo is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his kill pressure increases. You should play respectfully whenever his Ultimate R is up as he can quite easily kill you.\n\nYasuo is really good in team fights if he is picked in a team with multiple knock-ups. Avoid grouping too closely otherwise, he could get a 5 person Ultimate R off."}
{"text": "As irelia, At level nine, Irelia will be able to max out her Q. Being her central damage ability, she will be able to outplay her enemies for days now. The sustain will be pretty decent too.\n\nOnce she manages to get an extra point in her Ultimate R, she will use the ability frequently in the lane. This will lead to her taking more skirmishes and winning most duels in the game.\n\nIrelia is excellent at skirmishing due to her mobility, damage reduction, and Ultimate R. Fighting in chokepoints and the objective pits will surely get her ahead in the game."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo may not join the team fights because it is not very good in them. Rather, it can be split pushing and trying to take targets in the side lanes. Make sure someone is able to prevent it from dividing. Teemo will place the mushrooms t around the lenses and in the areas of great circulation. Avoid going anywhere that Teemo has recently been in without a scanning lens. He and his teammates can be ready and wait and try to launch you. As Teemo will be cracked pushing or away from his team during the fights, you could use the advantage of numbers to force a 4v4 or 5v4 fight."}
{"text": "Against garen, Garen\u2019s build path can be very different from game to game. Keep an eye on his itemisation and play accordingly depending on what he is buying. If he is going full damage, you probably won\u2019t be able to fight him alone.\n \nIt will be difficult for Garen to engage or get on to carries in a team fight as he lacks hard CC. This means that he will try to flank in team fights with his Q. Make sure you ward to the side of you at all times and kite backwards as soon as he appears.\n \nAvoid wasting valuable resources like Summoner Spells or Ultimates on Garen unless you\u2019re certain you\u2019re able to kill him. Garen can quickly top up his health bar back to full thanks to his Passive which will result in your team losing out on key spells for the remaining of the fight."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Xin is vulnerable to CC during team fights, don\u2019t ignore him. Focus him down when he engages.\n\nAs he is a strong skirmishing champion, he will look for picks on enemies who are walking around Summoners Rift alone. Avoid walking in area\u2019s that are unwarded unless you know where Xin Zhao is.\n\nWhenever Xin Zhao\u2019s Ultimate R  is on cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable. Force team fights when his Ultimate R is down to increase your chances of winning the fight. "}
{"text": "As rumble, It can do a lot of damage to enemy units with its authorized passive Q and E that are close to it. This allows it to act easily as a disruptor during team fighting. Its E combined with its W can allow it to shoot down a single enemy target easily. The W shield allows it to mitigate a good amount of poke as well. Its Ultimate makes it a threat during team fighting. The enemy team cannot afford to fight in closed spaces or they will certainly get shot by its Ultimate"}
{"text": "Against velkoz, Try your hardest to dodge Vel\u2019koz Q\u2019s in lane. Invest in early Boots if you\u2019re struggling to dodge this ability. \n\nAs soon as he channels his Ultimate R, either disengage, CC him or commit to the all-in. Hard CC will interrupt his Ultimate R, but roots do not.\n\nAfter he has got his first item, Vel\u2019koz will constantly push the minion wave. Stand close but outside of the minion wave at all times so he is unable to push and poke at the same time."}
{"text": "As naafiri, At level 16, you will have put the third and final point in your Ultimate. You will be strong enough and your all-in-pot potential will be high. In the late part, you will start to fall a bit because the teams will be grouped together so you have to play with your team. The enemy group together will reduce your chances of getting choices. Of course, you will have a lot of finished items, or are in the middle of construction at this stage of the game, so you should be able to do a lot of damage and survive fighting."}
{"text": "As alistar, When playing Yuumi against Alistar, keep in mind that jumping off your ADC when he has his CC tools up can be risky. Wait for Alistar to use or miss his Q before poking.\n\nBest times to get off your ADC and harass Alistar are when he has wasted his Q. You can jump off your ADC and hit him with a couple autos while it's down.\n\nBe sure to communicate with your team by pinging when Alistar roams. When he does, it's a good opportunity to get off your ADC and try to harass the enemy ADC with your auto-attacks.\n\nTo reduce the risk of all-ins, try to position the minion wave closer to your turret. This can make it harder for Alistar to engage on your ADC and can give you more time to react."}
{"text": "As karthus, Try to go for short gusts with your 1 in the track. The goal is to make sure that the enemy can't everything within you during the laning phase. Ward around and just aims to play safely. Once you get your first component, you should spam your abilities more frequently in the track. It will help you use your n combined with your 1 to go for regular trades with the enemy. You must always play safely, however. By getting your E Ultimate, you should be able to finish the killings in other tracks. Make sure that you are neutral, objective fights as well as your e will be really effective in these situations."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Quite vulnerable when his E is down. This can allow the enemy to all-in him and kill him quite easily during the early game.\n\nHis Ultimate R positioning can get him killed if his team doesn\u2019t follow up on him. Besides, going in too deep without any assistance can also get him killed.\n\nPantheon loses most level 6 all-ins against champions with strong damaging Ultimates. This will make his level 6 power spike much weaker compared to many champions."}
{"text": "As senna, Watch your position at all times so it can't put crucial spells on you. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to force it to overtake for the farm. Senna is weak enough early, you might be able to abuse it to gain an early health benefit. But if you can, don't worry. Focus on agriculture early if you can't get killed."}
{"text": "Against galio, Try and stay at the maximum range at any time to make it very difficult for Galio to use his E and W aggressively to tease you. It is much stronger and has good gank set up when it is healthy and these two abilities are increasing. Galio, the biggest peak of power is reached at level 6. His R gives a great opportunity to gank and to help other lines or to present himself in a team struggle. However, it does not have much to kill the threat against enemy travelers in a 1v1 at level 6. After Galio has finished his first article and has many points in his Q and E, he will be able to quickly push the wave and roll."}
{"text": "As annie, She can protect her ADC or herself with her E, which is traditionally taken third. This offers her game potential more and also more survival. Annie will always be a little strong when she has her dizziness ready or almost ready. If the enemy seeks to fight you while you have max piled up, you can quickly turn around the fight. Annie is better peak power in the way is once she unlocks Tibbers R. She can look for aggressive choices and Flash plays with Tibbers and her dizziness."}
{"text": "As skarner, In the late game, continue to look for flanks with your E and R. \n\nPlay around your Ultimate cooldown in the late game. Avoid team fighting when your Ultimate is down to ensure that you\u2019re useful in team fights!\n\nGroup with your allies as the enemy will just force an engage and kill your team while you\u2019re not with them.\n"}
{"text": "As lucian, Once Lucian unlocks his 3rd stage Ultimate R, he will be able to bring tons of constant damage, especially to low health targets. This will make it easier for him to break up enemies. Lucian will have access to several articles during this stage of the game. He will be able to both support himself, as well as provide high amounts of constant damage. Lucian Q and E will be maximized during this stage of the game. It will allow him to systematically and will allow him to reposition himself frequently."}
{"text": "As renekton, Once Renekton gets two points in his Ultimate t, he will be able to run down enemies with ease. The best effect will be seen during fights around chokepoints, though, as the enemies won't be able to run away easily.\n\nRenekton will have multiple items now. This means that he will be dealing a lot of damage to his enemies while simultaneously tanking a lot of damage. Any enemy who gets caught out by him will get chunked out and probably die.\n\nRenekton is decent in the mid-game, but he should focus on ending the game during this phase of the game itself. Taking as many team fights as possible and getting rid of the enemy backline is his win condition."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Xerath has a very reliable wave and grows thanks to its low cooling capabilities and kit. Avoid taking unnecessary damage by standing outside the minion wave when it uses its capabilities. Watching to trade with Xerath when its 2 or r is on cooldown. When it does not have any of these capabilities, it is incredibly vulnerable. Mixing this with its low mobility- it is easy to pick up for any attacker. Avoid roaming if Xerath is in the way as it can push the way very quickly while you are gone."}
{"text": "As hwei, Stay with your team in the late game so you do not get caught out of position and die due to low mobility.\n\nLook for picks with your allies. Don\u2019t be afraid to use your R to get picks with them. You also have CC tools, so don\u2019t be afraid to try to make plays as long as your allies can follow up.\n\nYou\u2019re good at fighting around objectives, so try to make plays with your R around these major objectives in the late game.\n"}
{"text": "As vladimir, His early play is terrible, and he should avoid fighting for longer periods during this game phase. Focus on the scale and get your first element. Level six is a decent power peak. It allows Vladimir to release his burst combo and develop a decent amount of pressure to kill in the way. It will allow him to impact the fights quite easily from now on."}
{"text": "Against nunu, When it comes to securing an objective like the Dragon or Baron, never go for the 50/50. Because of Nunu\u2019s Q, he will win every battle. Try to take the objective when he is dead or on the other side of the map.\n\nNunu is rather immobile when it comes to team fighting (once the fight has started). Lock him down with crowd control and kite him during the team fight so he is unable to be the frontline and get on to your carries.\n\nDo not clump together when it comes to team fighting. If you stand close to one another, he will use his Snowball W to engage from afar and run into the enemy. If you are all close to one another- he might be able to get a 5 person knock up. Instead, group but not too closely."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, If Tryndamere has Ignite, expect him to play aggressively and look for an all-in at level 2 or 3. Once Tryndamere reaches level 6, his survival increases a ton. Avoid committing yourself to fight with him when his Ultimate e is up unless you can easily beat him in a skirmish. Tryndamere is really good in the late game and will watch constantly divide the thrust and take goals. Do not let him take your laps for free while you skim in the middle track."}
{"text": "As gragas, If you can't gank, when he's on the opposite side of the map, try to invade the other side of his jungle to steal his camps or take a goal. Gragas can use his Bodyslam E to intercept your engagement. With this in mind, wait for him to use his E before diving into him unless you can get the grip on him. Once you get your Ultimate, it's key that you use it. Gank every time you reach 6 and gank every time your Ultimate is out of cooldown. Every second with it could mean you miss on a murder."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Your early Dragon control is far superior to Evelynn\u2019s. With this in mind, try to secure early Dragons to get your team ahead. One way of doing this is by ganking mid or bot and then rotating straight after.\n\nAs Evelynn will not be ganking early, try to gank as much as you can to get your allies ahead\n\nEvelynn is weak in the early game and will be trying to power farm until level 6. Try to invade her to delay her level 6 power spike.\n\nTry to track her through good vision placed inside her jungle. Pre-6, this will help your team know where she is and post 6 it will help reduce ganks. Control Wards in bushes and Yellow Wards on her camps will make tracking her easy."}
{"text": "As malzahar, It is fragile early because its presence is negligible, and its capabilities are telegraphed. All it has to do is to maintain its health and use its passive until it reaches level six. Once it reaches level six, its presence will skyrocket, becoming a major threat to the enemy's lantern. Working with the ally Jungler will help it massively. The first element will allow it to spam its abilities quite frequently. It will also allow it to inflict more damage, especially when it has its final R."}
{"text": "Against darius, Darius is really strong once he has time to apply multiple stacks of his Passive onto an enemy champion. Do not let him do this by staying out of melee range and avoiding extended trades.\n \nDarius is very strong at level 6 as his Ultimate e is an execute. Recall if you\u2019re low at level 5 in case he gets the level up and tries to kill you. \n \nDarius has a very strong level 2 all-in. Take extra care when trading with him at level 1, and definitely do not fight him at level 2 as he will beat you."}
{"text": "As nunu, Nunu's early game is strong enough as it can gank enemies frequently while remaining relatively healthy due to its Q. Level 6 is a massive peak as it allows Nunu's ganks to be more effective. It will also be a better team hunter and inflict tons of damage. Its objective control prowess is next to none. One can be sure that a good Nunu player will never lose any objective fight in the game."}
{"text": "As ivern, Ivern's true enabling potential will come at level nine, where he has his E maxed out. He can now peel for his carries with utmost ease or use his E's slow to initiate an all-in.\n\nHis Ultimate R will have two points once he hits level 11. This will be an excellent time for him to start fights, especially those involving tower diving and enemy or taking a neutral objective.\n\nIvern excels in team fights because he can peel for his carries while ensuring that his Ultimate R does all the dirty work for him. He can easily make it target one enemy and allow his team to collapse on them."}
{"text": "As viktor, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning. You need to poke the enemy down and delay fights in the late game, but you need to watch your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not get picked off by trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As shen, His E is quite short-ranged which makes it hard for him to land this ability from clear vision. This can hamper his all-in potential.\n\nIf he uses his W and Q carelessly, then he and his team will be in a really disadvantageous position, and will get pelted down quite easily.\n\nHis Ultimate R has a very long cooldown and will force him to lose priority almost instantly. "}
{"text": "Against velkoz, Velokoz first peak of major power is once it reaches level 6 that its Ultimate R offers him tons of pressure to kill. Once Velokoz has its first element finished, it will constantly push the minion wave and try to bring you down. Velokoz is really good in team fighting thanks to the poke and AOE damage of his abilities. Try to fight when he is not there or when his Ultimate R is down."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble is excellent during late-game fights as his Ultimate b and his basic abilities will all hit like a truck now, especially during team fights.\n\nMaxing out his Ultimate b will reduce the ability's cooldown and allow him to use it frequently. It will be a deciding factor during the objective fights.\n\nRumble will dish out a lot of damage during this phase of the game. His ability to melt through enemy health bars will force his enemies to play defensively."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Heimerdinger can take goals very quickly in the late game thanks to his Turrets Q. Be ready to make the call for them as you can often cheese them for free. Look for picks with your E to start the fight. If you are capable of CC all the enemy team, you will give your team a good chance to win the game. Keep peeling for your allies to keep them alive in the fights. You are good to peel, so you should do it in the late game."}
{"text": "Against hwei, He is not the strongest champion at the start of the game, but once he reaches level 3, his poke and damage release increases. When he reaches level 6, his Ultimate increases his pressure and ADC. This will help him get killed. The more the game goes, the stronger the Hwei will be. Once he gets more items under his belt, he's pretty good at the middle and end of the game."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Make sure you are always on the side of the map that the next major objective is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show yourself, the enemy will take the objective for free.\n\nLook to take down the enemy carries. Focus on the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them on your other frontline champions.\n\nEven though you are a laner, you can easily take down the Baron or the Dragon on your own. What you will want to do is try to sneak them out from the enemy team while your team is busy trying to distract the enemy."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Maokai is at his weakest during the early game. Look for an early advantage to force him to miss out on gold and XP.\n\nOnce Maokai is level 3, he can start trading with you once he has all of his basic abilities. Try and get him low so he is unable to look for a favourable trade.\n\nAvoid standing towards the top side of the lane if you know he\u2019s placed Saplings E in them. However, you could walk towards it before running away to \u201cbait\u201d out the Sapling E."}
{"text": "As sion, His tankiness will be really high during this phase of the game due to his items. That, combined with his W, will make him nearly unkillable and allow him to soak a lot of damage.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate R will further bolster his all-in potential and overall damage dealt in the long run. It will be a massive power spike for him as he can secure easy picks with it.\n\nHe is terrific during late-game team fights due to his Q and Ultimate R. His effectiveness increases if he manages to find a flank on his enemies or land his Ultimate R on a bunch of enemies clumped together."}
{"text": "As gwen, In the late game, stay with your team. Avoid moving too far away from them as the enemy may force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion in team fights. Even with your W, you are still squishy and vulnerable to the enemy backline. Focus the same champion as the one your allies are focusing.\n\nYou can dish out a ton of damage in late game team fights with your empowered Q damage. Ensure you\u2019re auto-attacking as much as you can to increase your Q damage."}
{"text": "As hwei, He will be stronger than you early, but once you have some levels under your belt you can start being a bit more aggressive.\n\nFocus on farming early and limit trading.

{"text": "As jarvaniv, If Jarvan builds AD, he is going to be very squishy in team fights and will get blown up quickly in team fights. Once he\u2019s gone in, he will need to fully commit to the fight. \n\nTo ensure victory, you need to make sure your team is in a position to follow up. If you go in without them, you\u2019re going to die.\n\nPeel, disengage and CC are J4\u2019s biggest weaknesses. He will be unable to use his d and e combo effectively if the enemy can poke him down, reposition or CC him mid-combo."}
{"text": "As sett, Sett is great in extended trades thanks to his Q. As long as he can stick to an enemy champion, he should win 1v1 fights.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to both get tanks off his carries as well as deal a lot of damage to the enemy team if he manages to ult his target into them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant.\n\nHis Passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so he can resort to short burst trades against enemy champions unlike other tanks. His W does deceptively high damage as well, while providing damage mitigation to him."}
{"text": "As taliyah, This is particularly true at the beginning of the game. Her Ultimate R has the probability of having her entire team killed if it is inappropriately used. She is also very vulnerable when her C is broken. The ground engineer on her Q can easily allow her drags to play in the middle of the track as she can continue to block her enemies with continuous Qs."}
{"text": "Against nunu, Nunu will be wandering a lot in the laning phase. Ping when it will miss so that your team knows it could be directed towards their path. Keep the wave pushed in its turn. You can secure the turn plates and get a significant XP and gold advance while it runs around the map. Try to counter Nunu roams when possible, but if you can, make sure you do as much as you can while it is not in the way (such as pushing, wandering elsewhere, helping your Jungler etc.)."}
{"text": "Against twistedfate, Once Twisted Fate has its components for its first item, it will be able to push quite easily with its s and d. Stand outside the minion wave so that it is unable to push you and poke at the same time. When Twisted Fate. D is on cooldown, you should look to abuse it and go for a trade. If it chooses a blue card, you can enter a trade. Avoid trading when it has the premium gold card. At level 6, Twisted Fate."}
{"text": "As zac, As soon as the enemy advances or surpasses, he can look to play aggressively. His passive and ultimate R can allow him to take a group of enemies alone out of a large combat team by simply zoning them. He can also inflict a lot of damage to the enemy's rear line if they ignore Zac. Zac has good support in the way, thanks to his blobs. Additional health and maintenance allows him to survive more difficult matches and heal the enemy."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Make sure you're still on the side of the map that the next major goal is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free. Look to remove the enemy carriers. Focus on the backline and try to get them out of the fight. Focus them on your other front line champions. Even if you're a laner, you can easily get the Baron or the Dragon down on your own. What you want to do is try to get them out of the enemy team while your team is busy trying to distract the enemy."}
{"text": "Against fiora, Fiora is a large divided pusher and one of the best duelists in the game thanks to her Ultimate R and Q. If you can't pair her in a side track, try your best to force an uneven team fight on the other side of the map. Fiora relies heavily on the theft of life. Buy a serious injury item early to neute a large part of what makes her such a good duelist. Keep a constant eye on Fiora's map and location when you're bundled with your team. If it disappears, expect her to join the team fight. If she stays in a side track, don't let her destroy your base while you're trying to fight."}
{"text": "As kayle, Kayle is weak early, so she will have to depend on her Q for most of her poke and agriculture in the way. This is the phase that must be played very carefully by Kayle. Her level six is a massive peak of power due to her varied automatic attacks. This will allow her to play more liberally and let her play the way more safely. Kayle's first article will help her a lot in trade and agriculture. This is really useful for her and will help her scale quickly from now on."}
{"text": "As neeko, Don't fight in the late part unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available because you're going to miss the extra damage and CC. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooling time in the final stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone isolated and alone, too far ahead or away from the position. Peel for your maneuvers to keep them alive longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "Against galio, When Galio charges you, try to disengage as quickly as possible. If you let him approach, he will seek to engage with his E and then tease you with his W. As soon as Galio loses the level of position 6, ping your team as he might seek to wander with his Ultimate R. If you are a varied support, use your range advantage to harass and bring him down every time he advances to secure minions on his pupil quest."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Morgana is good at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Until then, her death pressure is not the best, but it increases once that ability unlocked. Once Morgana has Zhonyas Hurglass, her survival in team fighting will increase. Try to fight her when her Zhonyas is down, she is unable to defend herself. Every time Morgana has her Blackshield E available, her protection increases considerably and it will be difficult for you to kill her or the CDA when she can block CC. Try to fight when this ability is down."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana is very weak before-6, and you are much stronger than her. Go and invade her and try to fight her to deny her gold and XP. Post 6, it will be harder to fight her alone, so keep this in mind if you want to play aggressively. Try gank as often as you can early. You are much stronger than her and can get a lead just by being active on the card. Don't forget Shyvana. Make sure you take these Dragons away from her whenever possible."}
{"text": "As kayle, Stay away from your team and look to farm and gain as much XP as possible. You need to hit your level spikes as fast as possible and one way you can do this is by staying in a side lane.\n\nFocus on farming and avoid fighting in the mid-game. If you die or have to burn your Flash, you\u2019re going to be incredibly vulnerable.\n\nSplit push and stay away from your team unless they need you. You will be stronger if you avoid fighting and grouping unless you have to."}
{"text": "As varus, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As yone, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "Against lux, Always make sure you\u2019re stood behind at least 2 minions so she is unable to root you with her g.\n\nIf Lux uses her g and it misses, use the cooldown of this ability to play aggressive as she will be unable to protect herself and prevent the all-in.\n\nMitigate Lux\u2019s l effectiveness by standing behind and not inside the minion wave. This will make her choose between using her l to poke with or to push with."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas gets to level 16, he will have his Ultimate R maxed out. It will give him a massive damage boost, and the low cooldown combined with the knockback will help him pick high-priority targets.\n\nGragas will either be highly tanky or a glass cannon dependent on landing his combo depending on the build. As a top laner, Gragas may go for a balanced or a tanky build, which makes him the main damage absorber and engager for the team.\n\nHis dash and Ultimate R make up for a significant amount of peel for his carries. Should he go for the tank build route, he will successfully absorb a lot of damage for his team while his team follows up on Gragas' engagement."}
{"text": "As kindred, They are going to be ganking early, and Pantheon can gank early too. Make sure you apply as much pressure to them as you can.\n\nBefore invading, make sure you have your Passive stacked so you can win the trade.\n\nIf they invade you, be prepared to fight, but only do so if your Passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just back off.\n\nPost 6, they win the 1v1 as they\u2019re stronger when their Ultimate is up.\n"}
{"text": "As poppy, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Stay with your team at the end of the game. Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}

Any fight around chokepoints will allow Vladimir to win the fight immediately due to his sustain and damage.\n\nMultiple items will let him deal more damage to enemies, especially those who clump up together during team fights. He should be relatively safe as well and will heal from a ton of damage.\n\nHis life steal and damage during the late game will make him really good in team fights. He will just need to use his l and Q at the proper times, and he will be unkillable."}
{"text": "Against amumu, Amumu is pretty vulnerable to poke damage. Try and harass him as much as possible to make it near impossible for him to go in without dying in return.\n\nAmumu\u2019s level 6 is very good. Once he hits level 6, try and position away from your other laner so he cannot CC both of you with his Ultimate y.\n\nWatch your positioning throughout the game. Try and position so you\u2019re always behind 1 minion so it is impossible for him to land his s on you."}
{"text": "As varus, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nConstantly push and poke the enemy with your abilities. Once they\u2019re low, you can look for an aggressive all-in. However, while kills are nice, your goal is to poke and not commit to fights.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As warwick, Can\u2019t gank effectively until he gets his Ultimate R. This gives a huge window where enemy laners can easily get a lead on Warwick\u2019s allies.\n\nHis E forms a major part of his kit which allows him to dive into the enemy team. Without this, he can\u2019t do much so keeping a track on this ability\u2019s usage will allow his enemies to counter Warwick quite easily.\n\nWarwick\u2019s Q can carry him to the enemy champion, but this can be used against him as bait. Any champion with a blink or dash can easily displace him under their tower and put him in a very disadvantageous position."}
{"text": "As ryze, Focus on farming and getting as much gold and XP as possible. You need time and gold before you\u2019re able to come online and deal damage.\n\nYour champion is incredibly weak in the early game. Focus on farming and avoid fighting with the enemy until you\u2019ve got an item behind you.\n\nAfter your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. Do not fight anyone unless you have an advantage over them. Continue to get XP and gold."}
{"text": "Against rell, Avoid fighting in areas of the map that force your champions to be close to each other. Rellos Ultimate R is an excellent team combat tool that can CC multiple enemies at a time. CC and interruptions are the best way to counter Rellos W engage in team fighting. Hold on to these abilities to interrupt his engagement and burst while it is immobilized."}
{"text": "As seraphine, The second point of his Ultimate R will allow him to inflict increased damage to the enemies while using it frequently. It will allow him to get far too many peaks in the middle of the game. His middle of the game is solid.

{"text": "As neeko, Great pick potential with her E especially when the target is hiding behind their minion wave. Her Q provides for a good amount of wave clear which helps her get lane priority.\n\nExtremely useful in team fights due to her Ultimate R CC and damage. This allows her team to play around her and her Jungler to gank her.\n\nHer Passive combined with her Ultimate R can be a deadly combo. If she goes AD, she can run any enemy down if they don\u2019t have some form of CC ability on them."}
{"text": "Against lulu, In team fights, try to catch Lulu out of position or lock her down with CC. If you can take her down first, her ability to protect her carries will be lessened. If you can\u2019t kill her, you might be able to force herself to self-cast her Ultimate R.\n\nFor AD champions, invest in an Executioner's Calling when Lulu and her team is ahead. This will reduce her healing and shielding capability on her allies.\n\nForcing team fights when Lulu\u2019s Ultimate R is on cooldown is the best way to win fights as she will be unable to protect herself or her allies."}

{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton will look to split push when no team fights are occuring. Make sure someone who can contest him is stopping him from split pushing. Do not send someone who is unable to beat him to stop him from pushing.\n\nFor his e to be effective, he will need to get as close to the enemy as possible in a team fight. With this in mind, Renekton will probably try to flank in a team fight rather than run towards you. Make sure your flanks are warded so you can spot him before he gets the chance to engage.\n\nRenekton has great pick potential so watch your positioning. It is not uncommon for Renekton to Flash e to catch someone out who is too far forward."}

Her W allows her to tank with ease too.\n\nVery good objective control and sustain due to her Passive and her damage. Can easily get her team an early dragon lead, after successfully ganking a lane with her Q.\n\nHer Ultimate R can allow her to focus a target down, which has two uses depending on her role in the game.

{"text": "As draven, Draven's beginning game is solid. It can come out of the trade most of the lower track champions because of its g. You have to look for fights in the beginning of the game to cash in your Passive. Draven's level 6 power peak is powerful. Its Ultimate t can be used during the skirmishes, unlike some ADC's such as Caitlyn. Commit to all-in if you have a slight advance so that you can, once again, cash from your Passive. After Draven's first return, it will be able to get out of the trade the enemy trailers because of its g. Regardless of whether the enemy ADC has taken the same items as you, you will always win a fight. A good Draven is not afraid of the enemy- keep this in mind."}
{"text": "Against zac, His early play is rather weak, but killing him can be difficult. Expect him to focus on agriculture rather than fighting in the game very early. Zac is really good in team fights because his kit has tons of CC. Try to disengage whenever he E.S. in to make it harder for him to get a good knockup. Once Zac hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his death pressure increases."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Its Q is its main poke capability, and it is quite reliable, so adding more points in it will directly increase its overall damage in the track. It will allow it to decimate its opposition, mainly when it uses the ability of a brush. The first element will allow it to spam its capabilities constantly due to its increased mana pool. It will also increase its overall damage, which will allow it to take completely on the path that its clear wave is impeccable. Ziggs is relatively low early compared to other ADCs. It is because it is able to be dependent on traditional ADCs that are self-attacks that are related. This can get him out of mana quickly and be useless in the way. To compensate for this, it should use the track brushes to zone enemies. It is not necessary to use capabilities as the threat is sufficient to keep enemies at hand."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah will want to delay a team's fight as long as possible while pushing you with its Q. Try and force a fight as soon as you spot it. Avoid separating and playing alone. Taliyahs Ultimate R will allow it to take enemies who are alone or isolated without assistance. Do not push too far forward if you don't have anyone nearby. Taliyah has good potential with its C. If you don't know where Taliyah is in the middle of the game, don't walk around Summoners Rift alone and avoid areas with no vision that it might be looking for a surprise attack."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin is an aggressive champion early. Expect him to go for aggressive games to get an early lead. Watch your positioning at any time in this matchup. If you can stand behind the minions, it will be really hard for him to land his e on you.

Her damage output in team fights will be very high, especially if she has a few items or a lead over the enemy Jungler.\n\nAs Diana has an assassin playstyle, once she has multiple items completed in the mid-game, her burst potential will be highly potent. She will easily be able to take down squishy targets that are walking around Summoners Rift alone."}

Avoid fighting in areas around the map that are locked up like in the jungle or around the Baron / Dragon as it will allow Yone to get a good R Ultimate. Just like the laning phase, avoid hunting Yone down if he runs away as he's just going to use his E for you Juke."}
{"text": "As veigar, Very motionless and is extremely vulnerable to crowd control. It has a weak early game as well, so it can easily be abused and killed with some ganks. Its n is on a really long cooldown, and it's its only form of self-peel. Once it's down, it can easily be all-in-a-d and killed with crowd control. It will take a lot of time to come online if it gets killed a few times during the early game. It's not going to be very effective if the game continues for too long so try to close it early and finish the game quickly."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Its level eleven is not too good because it does not give it much statistics. The Ultimate e in itself will be convenient, however, and Trendamere can use track brushes to catch the enemy by surprise. Trendamere is really good at the split thrust due to its kit. It allows it to 1 v 1 targets with ease while making sure that it can escape in time if the enemy team decides to collapse on it. It can roughly duel any enemy during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of mana problems in the beginning of the game, but once she gets Tear of the Goddess, she will play a lot more aggressive. Cassiopeia really shines in the end of the game. She swings better than most champions and she can build 6 items. If you get early- Try to close the game as soon as possible. Not many champions are as strong as Cassiopeia is at level 2. Beware of Level 2 all of it with her Q and E spam."}
{"text": "As ahri, When Ahri hits level 11, she will have 2 points in her Ultimate. This offers her extra pick potential during the mid-game.\n\nAt level 9, Ahri will max out her Q. She will be able to easily push the minion wave during this stage of the game. Mix this with the items she picks up beforehand, she can constantly keep the enemy pushed into their tower.\n\nSince Ahri is a burst Mage Assassin, when multiple items are completed, she will be able to secure picks on squishy targets throughout the mid-game: leading to a possible neutral objective advantage. "}
{"text": "As brand, In the late game, Brand will be near full build. This is a significant power spike for Brand as his damage output should be incredibly high. However, he needs to make sure he doesn\u2019t get caught out in the late game or else he will not dish out any damage.\n\nAt level 16, Brand can put the third and final point in his Ultimate R. He will be able to dish out a lot of damage on grouped enemies in late game team fights.\n\nTake note that while you will have a lot of damage, the enemy team should have started building defensive items to counter your abilities. Try to blow up targets that are squishy or who lack defensive stats."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Don't hang on to the minions or stay still in this matchup. If you don't get there, you'll be shot down and CC'd regularly Use your tornado to keep hitting the enemy regularly. Use your passive shield on the other hand to mitigate the damage you take while trying to reach them. Your windshield will be really beneficial in this matchup. Use it to counter the Seraphine Ultimate as much as you can. Keep the wave in the middle of the track. This will prevent you from getting besieged under your turn and give you opportunities to everything in the enemy."}
{"text": "As talon, Mid-game will let him secure multiple kills due to the way the enemies will be rotating. He can easily catch enemies roaming on their own.\n\nAnother point in his Ultimate R will boost his overall damage in the game. This will allow him to burst down squishies easily.\n\nThe first ability max at level 9 will allow him to deal a lot of damage to the enemy he uses it on. It will also let him proc his Passive easily, which means that he will get kills quickly with it.        "}
{"text": "As poppy, Very strong all-in-the-way potential with its E. This when combined with its slow Q, can allow it to lock an enemy for a while. Its W is the jerk of any champion with dashes, especially all carriers that depend on their dashes. Its Ultimate R can allow it to turn the tide of a fight almost immediately because it can turn a 5 v 5 into a 5 v 2 easily. It also acts as a great source of disengagement for it."}
{"text": "As karthus, They have global card pressure with their Ultimate. So ping when Karthus hits level 6. Watch your positioning at all times and stay away from the minion wave (especially after Karthus has its first component element). Karthus is still and easy to gank. Keep the wave closer to your side of the map to force him to lie down and miss the position for the farm. Try and go for prolonged automatic attack fights with him that you will win those. But try and reposition so that he cannot easily land his Qs on you."}
{"text": "As yorick, Avoiding Yorick's E is going to be really important in this lane. You can use your E to do so but make sure you get rid of the ghouls first if you do get hit by his E.\n\nYour Q should let you trade a lot if you manage to use the lane brushes properly. An excellent time to all-in him will be where his Q graves won't be present.\n\nOnce you unlock your Ultimate, you should be able to 1 v 1 him quickly. Just bait his E out first so that you can take more minor damage during the trade.\n\nGet some Grievous Wounds to mitigate Yorick's healing. Also, if he happens to use his Ultimate, disengage immediately.\n"}
{"text": "As shaco, He isn\u2019t only a threat on a physical level, but the mental warfare he instills upon the enemy squishies allows Shaco to make multiple plays which other Champions can\u2019t make. He can leave the lane and roam quite easily to get a cheese gank off (even if he is laning).\n\nHis x can allow him to disengage as well as surprise all-in champions easily. This also acts as a counter to carries who have dashes and rely on kiting to win fights.\n\nHis e allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease. When combined with his Ultimate l, his enemy can be baited to attack the clone and CC the enemy team/champion that attacked it."}
{"text": "Against zyra, Zyra is strong at level 3 because she has access to her two Qs and Es. Expects that she will take a lot of damage in a job. Once Zyra reaches level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, her death pressure increases considerably and she can shoot the most squishi of the champions."}
{"text": "As ryze, Another point in his Ultimate R will not do him much good either. This will allow him to turn easily, but apart from that, there is nothing much to that. Ryze will now have his basic items, which means that he will cut down more damage than early play. He still hasn't reached his final form yet, however. Ryze will fight during mid-game fights because his damage will not be enough for the enemies at one stroke. He will have to be careful to get CC'd as well."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Nautilus has an incredibly strong level 2, make sure you hit level 2 first and look for an aggressive play.\n\nStaying healthy is key when playing Nautilus. If you get poked down, you\u2019ll never be able to engage. When you\u2019re waiting on your cooldowns, play safe and out of auto-attack range.\n\nUse Nautilus\u2019s strong roaming ability to move around the map and help your allies. Good times to roam are straight from base or when your ADC will be safe and will not die."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, At level thirteen, his e and d will be maximized, and he will be able to look for peaks more often. The best place to do so will be in the unrewarded areas of the map and in the choking points. Once he reaches level 16, he will have 3 points in his Ultimate m. This increases the overall production of damage and will allow Jarvan to use the ability quite often. This will help his team to follow the fights with ease. Jarvan becomes really tanky during the late match. This allows him not only to be an activator for his team but also allows him to survive all the in and peel for his wears during important battles."}
{"text": "As samira, Just like in the middle of the game, you have to stay with your support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone because you will die easily. Do not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and automatic attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will concentrate and down you. Continue kiteing in team fights and systematically adapt your positioning."}
{"text": "As jax, He is really weak against single target CC. During a team fight, if he happens to get chain CC\u2019d, he will die before he can achieve something significant.\n\nThe enemy can always react to Jax\u2019s plays and send someone from their team to prevent him from split pushing. They can even kill his entire team and then go for crucial objectives like the Baron.\n\nWeak against champions who are ranged and can kite him out of his Q range. This allows the enemy to poke him out and then all-in him once he has been whittled down."}
{"text": "As nasus, At level 9, Nasus will max his first ability. His damage output and trading potential at this stage of the game will be quite high.\n\nAt level 11, Nasus will put the second point in his Ultimate R. He will be really tanky and strong post level 16.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Nasus would\u2019ve picked up several hundred stacks on his Q. Keep farming and you\u2019ll become a huge threat soon.\n"}
{"text": "Against lux, Lux is really strong once she unlocks her Ultimate n. At this point, she will be able to get killed and crush you. Once Lux has a maximum cooldown reduction, her abilities will be on really weak cooldowns. This means she will be able to poke and trade quite frequently. Don't let her cooldowns take you by her cooldowns. In the later stages of the game, Lux is really strong and can very easily remove any target if she lands her g. Try and place her behind in the early game so she can't get tons of AP and snowball."}
{"text": "As sett, Once Sett gets 3 points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to execute his enemies with ease and will be able to use the ability quite frequently. This allows him to do a quick job of the tanks. Sett is decent during the last parts of the game. He can cut a ton of damage while simultaneously peeling for his team and acting as a worthy front lining. Sett's ability to get peaks during the end of the game is phenomenal. He excels in the fights that occur near the bottlenecks, which makes it really difficult for enemies to try and get neutral goals."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Pyke is strong at level 1 and 2. Make sure to hit level 2 at the same time or before him to reduce his ability to get an early murder. Once Pyke touches level 6, his death pressure increases as his Ultimate R is an execution. Step back when weak so he is unable to kill you and snowball his lead. Pyke is really good at roaming. Once he has Mobi Boots, expect him to wander around the map and help his allies. Ping every time he disappears."}
{"text": "As pantheon, He will fall off later during the game due to the enemy purchasing defensive items. He should still rely on picks to get kills all around the map.\n\nLevel 16 isn't that great a spike as it will only increase the damage of the ability and reduce the cooldown.\n\nPantheon is pretty tanky in the late game and can dish out tons of damage as well. His E and W allow him to quickly pick off targets without taking damage in return."}
{"text": "As illaoi, It completely decimates the melee matches, especially those who forget or are unable to get out of its Ultimate R. This ability also allows it to impact a team fight when there are several divers in the enemy team. Its E allows it to put in place ganks for its Jungler with ease. Using this ability with its Ultimate R can allow it to cut an enemy with ease, as the enemy has won not to be able to escape the ray ofult quickly. Its Passive allows it to endure the damage it inflicts. It is very beneficial when using its Ultimate R in the midst of a group of enemy champions. It will be practically invalidable and the enemy will have to decide whether to flee or fight."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Tryndamere isn\u2019t that good if he is behind and low on gold. He needs lots of gold and XP to solo carry in the later parts of the game.\n\nWhenever his Ultimate e is down, he is quite vulnerable which makes him (somewhat) weaker.\n\nCan be kited quite easily and is prone to disengage/CC in team fights. This can make team fighting challenging for a Tryndamere. "}
{"text": "As draven, Draven is one of the strongest ADC champions around. Use your early game pressure to play aggressive and get kills.\n\nThanks to his Passive and g, Draven can earn more gold than a lot of champions if he is able to cash out on his stacks.\n\nDraven is an incredibly strong 1v1 champion and he can out damage and beat most enemy ADC\u2019s in a 1v1. This makes him a great pick into the majority of ADC matchups."}
{"text": "As darius, The extended trades work in favor of Darius thanks to his passive. He will win almost all the automatic attack battles. This makes him a great duelist in low ELO as many players like to fight constantly. Darius is really good in team fights thanks to his Ultimate e that can be reset if he gets the hit killer with her. He has a good potential for gank and can start to gaunt after level 3."}
{"text": "As gangplank, You will want to avoid getting poked out in this matchup. Watch out for barrells in the brushes as well.\n\nKeep a close eye on his Ultimate usage. If he uses it in some other lane, you will have an easy time all-in'ing him.\n\nShort trades are generally a bad idea for you due to how your kit functions and your lack of mobility. Try to get to the enemy backline when possible to cause mayhem.\n\nKeep the wave somewhere in the middle of the lane. It will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down."}
{"text": "As senna, Very effective long-range poke and passive supply agency. Its poke also allows it to heal with its Q, so it is really good against poke. Its W can allow it to CC a whole group of enemies with the greatest ease. This ability becomes very powerful when it fights in closed spaces. Its E can allow it to sneak all a team through an unrewarded area and to surprise an enemy team."}
{"text": "As illaoi, Illaoi is an excellent split pusher. She can take on multiple people on her own due to her tentacles and Ultimate R. At one point, the enemy team will have to send in more than two people to deal with her.\n\nIllaoi is also good in team fights as her Ultimate R prevents the enemy from getting close to her or her team. She also dishes out a lot of damage which can easily wipe out a team if they are not careful.\n\nOnce she gets two points in her Ultimate R, she will dish out a ton of damage during team fights. Enemies won't be able to do much except maintain distance from her at all times. Illaoi can also use the fog of war to set up death brushes."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Level 3 is an important power lever for Hecarim. It can look for an easy all-in on the enemy to launch with its capabilities. Going for short gusts while using the track brushes to drop the vision on the enemy would be the best line of action. Once Hecarim hits level 6, it can terrorize enemies with its flanking potential. This will allow Hecarim to completely isolate a target from their team and shoot them down with the help of his team. Its support will be quite high as well (due to runes and the flight of life). The first component will allow Hecarim to more reliable duel in this way."}
{"text": "As lux, Work with your Jungler and set up traps inside the enemy Jungle once you're done shoving the wave in. Your g will allow you to get free kills effortlessly.\n\nFighting around choke points will be really good for you, so look for opportunities to do so. This is especially applicable during neutral, objective fights in the game.\n\nGetting your core items will make you really powerful. Use the brushes to set up death traps for squishies in your lane. Also, transition to the mid-lane as quickly as you can.        "}
{"text": "As elise, Its mobility makes it really difficult for you to win any fight against it, so it's probably better to avoid trying to fight it early on. It's an early ganker and has a strong presence of early play. Look to counter gank it and try to be as proactive as you can be early on. At level 6 is where you really come online. Look at gank every time your Ultimate is up. Make sure to focus these goals that you have good objective control and can take them easily."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Disengage is your best friend when dealing with Neeko and her Ultimate R in team fights. Disengage as soon as Neeko walks forward and tries to engage to minimize the usefulness of her Ultimate R.\n\nWard your flanks and nearby bushes when sieging objectives as Neeko may use her Passive and W to get a good engage off with her Ultimate R.\n\nSplitting up and not standing too close together will help reduce how many people Neeko and stun with her Ultimate R. Group when team fighting, but don\u2019t stand too close together."}
{"text": "As kled, In the early game, try to keep the wave closer to your side, but don't let it bounce back. If it bounces, it can look at all of you. Keep the wave outside of your turn. In early play, try to keep the trades short and soft while keeping an eye on its bar if it is disassembled. Look for short, slippery trades rather than extended trades (regardless of the status mounted/demounted) as it is where Kled shines. Kled's second Q applies serious injuries, so try your best to escape the leash if his Q lands on you because it reduces your healing and survival. Walk backwards and out of reach, then reconnect with it once it has disappeared. While Kled when his W is about to cool as it is a large part of his damage."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Picks and ganks are the names of this phase. Make sure you blow up enemies quickly and snowball your lead in the game. Once you've finished with your basic items, you should be able to deposit a lot of damage. That being said, do not barricade in the enemy team/base. Otherwise, you will get CC'd and killed due to your squishiness. Roam with your Support and get some spikes in the enemy Jungle when possible. Bonus points if this is done before spawning a neutral goal."}
{"text": "As zoe, Can one-shot squishies as soon as she gets her Ultimate R. Getting hit by her E is a death sentence post-six, and her Ultimate\u2019s R mobility allows her to dodge skillshots.\n\nHer W is a powerhouse and can allow her to provide a lot of utility for both her team and herself. This ability can allow her to win the lane quite easily if she gets lucky.\n\nZoe\u2019s E can be used to set-up ganks from a long-range. The proper usage of terrain can help her roam to other lanes and get free kills with her E Q combo."}
{"text": "As yone, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Focus on getting level 3 quickly in this matchup and make sure that you ask for a hard leash early on. It will allow you to gank enemies quickly after that.\n\nLook to all-in overextended enemies as much as you can since your g and e will both facilitate CC'ing the enemy.\n\nBypassing vision is really important so make sure that you actively keep warding and dewarding the enemy Jungle. This should help you gank enemies with ease."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan does not do too well in the various matchesups and champions with easy to land CC because he will be unable to use his E aggressively. Its Ultimate can be interrupted quite easily. You must be very careful when you try to use it otherwise the enemy will cancel his channel. Versus poke or champions with a lot of clear wave, it will be almost impossible for you to wander and help your allies as the enemy will keep you pushed in or take your turn while you are roaming."}
{"text": "As sion, Stay together with your team. Do not leave the side of your carts otherwise, the enemy will capitalize on the fact and leave them defenceless. Peel for your carts in the team fights. After using your Q, retreat and protect your allies and focus on the nearest champion. Look for choices with your Ultimate R. If you can catch someone when the enemy is not organized, you can force a team fight or a goal afterwards."}
{"text": "As rumble, If your allies move on your track after destroying their turn, rotate and move around the map to continue growing and winning XP and gold. Use your capabilities to quickly clear the minion waves so your team can besiege/prevent an enemy team seat. If you can land poke while also pushing the minion wave, you can look for a favorable trade. By sitting Baron or Dragon, or whenever you push the enemy under their turn, look for a peak with your abilities. If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you will be able to take the goal for free."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Look to take down the enemy carries. Focus the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them with your other frontline champions.\n\nAs you\u2019re the Jungler, you need to make sure you\u2019re always alive in the late game. If you die before a major objective spawns, the enemy will be able to take it.\n\nMake sure you are always on the side of the map that the next major objective is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show yourself, the enemy will take the objective for free."}
{"text": "As naafiri, At level 9, you will have maximized your first ability that makes you much stronger in the skirmishes and clear the jungle. You are a good mid-game champion, and you will be able to easily remove the squishy champions in the middle of the game. At this stage of the game, you would have had several completed elements, so that you will naturally be strong enough."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Mordekaiser is quite motionless. If the enemy has a lot of mobility or tools to escape, it will be difficult for him to catch up with the enemy. Pre-6, if Mordekaiser misses his E, his ganks will fail. It is because he has no other forms of CC and it will be difficult for him to get to the target of flight. In the later parts of the game, the reduction of the pen and healing will greatly reduce his survival in the fights of the late game team."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Make sure you\u2019re always stood behind at least 1 minion so she is unable to land her Q and CC you.\n\nWhen playing as a hard engage Support, if she starts anything but E, look to play aggressively at level 1 to get an early advantage. \n\nMorgana\u2019s E has a really long cooldown. If you can bait it out, you should look to use the cooldown to re-engage and try to kill her."}
{"text": "As jhin, His Passive allows him to blow up squishies with ease. This can allow him to get a huge lead early on and then capitalize on it, and finish the game before key enemies come online.\n\nThe follow-up CC extension on his kit with his W and E is really strong. This is what makes him really good with champions who have hard CC or slows in their arsenal.\n\nHe can keep going for regular short trades with his auto-attacks and his Q. This will allow him to soften up his target without the help of his Support, and once they are low enough, he can all-in them. He becomes safer as he builds critical strike."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Keep your E for situations where you need to avoid getting CC'd. Use the track brushes as much as you can to make sure you can put your poke on the enemy team. This will allow you to accumulate an advance and push the enemy out of the way. During neutral objective fighting, your main goal is to make sure that you can pull the enemy team out before major Smite combat. In this way, they will not be able to do anything and will die if they try to do everything."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim's h will be maxed out once he hits level 9, which will allow him to dish out a lot of consistent damage when he is in the middle of the enemy team. It will also let him sustain himself due to his items and runes. As the top laner, he will be way tankier and can also peel for his team.\n\nHecarim's Ultimate t will be more robust now because it has two points at level 11. This means that he can use it frequently, which translates into more dead enemy carries.\n\nMid-game is when everyone is lane swapping and warding around. This is the perfect time for Hecarim to take over the game due to his kit being able to pick and burst enemies down in a jiffy. Since he is the top laner, he will want to work with his Jungler and get the Rift Heralds."}
{"text": "As taliyah, This is a farming matchup. Focus on farming and just harassing with your abilities.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave at all times. They will be trying to push, and by standing out of the wave, you force them to choose between using mana on the wave or you.\n\nInvesting in early boots can help you dodge their skill shots and make the laning phase less stressful.\n\nBe prepared to sacrifice CS for XP and health. Recall when you\u2019re low so you don\u2019t fall behind due to poke."}
{"text": "As zac, Your Q can allow you to kill enemies who decide to go through bottlenecks. Always make sure that you peel for your portages during the fight. Your tankness and Passive should allow you to do so very easily. Configure yourself by using the fog of war relentlessly. This will allow you to take enemies who wander without a goal through their Jungle."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Play safely in the game early. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you'll have trouble in the line and you'll delay your first major power peak. Focus on electric farming and minimize trading up to your level 6. Once you unlock your Ultimate k, you can start to be more aggressive. Once you're level 6, you can look at playing more aggressive than you can use your Ultimate k as a trading tool and something to come back on."}
{"text": "As singed, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "Against leblanc, When Leblancs W is on cooldown, it is squisher and vulnerable. You can use this delay to play aggressively and go for a trade because it will not be able to escape or trade as efficiently as possible with you. Standing outside the minion wave and far behind is a good way to reduce Leblancs' ability to push and poke at the same time with his W. If you stay as far as you can, she will be unable to land her W on you independently."}
{"text": "As rumble, Level six is a massive spike for him and his team. He can now affect fights easily with his Ultimate b and ensure that enemies can't fight him fair and square during fights.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to deal a lot of damage to his opponents. It will also be beneficial when he casts his Ultimate b.\n\nHis early game is good, but the outcome of the lane really depends on the matchup he is in. He should have quite an easy time in the lane as long as he can poke enemies consistently.        "}
{"text": "As gragas, Avoid the Gragas Q as much as you can because it can set up ganks for its team and causes a lot of damage. Use Gragas' W cooldown, which has a considerable duration and can be exploited to commit to it. Be careful to Gragas' E which allows it to fill the gaps quickly and it can also serve as a route of escape. Try to save your Ultimate for when Gragas uses its ultimate since, if it pushes you into his team, you could all with it quickly."}
{"text": "As drmundo, Be the first line for your team at all times. It's the key that when you play Dr. Mundo, you're always at the front of your team. After being the first line for your team, fall back and peel for your portages with your Q to keep them alive. If they die quickly, the team will fight more than you're going to miss damage. Avoid split thrust when the main goals are up as you will be the champion who can Smit the goal. If you have a split thrust when Baron is up, the enemy will be able to secure it for free."}
{"text": "As nasus, Split push and focus on securing towers while your team groups elsewhere on the map. Try to draw pressure while your team is able to get something done somewhere else on the map.\n\nBe prepared to group with your team when you\u2019re unable to get any more objectives alone. \n\nWhen you do team fight, make sure you peel for your carries. Use your W to slow the enemy frontline and then focus the nearest enemy champion in the fight."}
{"text": "Against zac, The Zacs E can be used from afar to start the team fight. Make sure to keep your flanks by sipping a goal. Avoid fighting in the jungle as it will be easier for Zac to land his E and hit your entire team with his Ultimate R. Fight in the open if possible. Do not regroup too closely. If you are slightly separated, it will be impossible for Zac to catch up and hit your entire team with his E and Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Be careful what happens on the map at all times. Don't let the enemy Jungler get all the Dragons. Try to secure them with your team after ruining the lower track. Beware of the pressure of the Fiddles at the beginning of the game. They are strong enough and will try to make games to get themselves and their teammates before."}
{"text": "As lux, Avoid detaching from your ally when Lux's Q (Light Binding) capability is available to minimize the risk of being caught in crowd control. During Levels 1 and 2, focus on pipping Lux as much as possible with your basic attacks to apply pressure and potentially gain an advantage. Keep the wave closer to your side of the road to create assistance opportunities in the jungle and have a longer way to pursue Lux and its ADC if necessary."}
{"text": "As seraphine, A maxed-out Ultimate R will help Seraphine out a lot during team fights. She can dish out a lot of damage, and the CC will allow her team to collapse on the enemy quickly.\n\nShe should be really great as the game goes on because she will be getting all her items by now. She will need to take care of her fighting positioning to ensure that she isn't picked off.\n\nAll her significant items will be completed now, and she will be able to dish out a lot of damage in very short burst trades. She will also provide a lot of peeling and healing for her teammates."}
{"text": "As chogath, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Use your e to launch a fight or try to take someone with it and then kill them. Once they are dead, either pass to the Baron or the Elder Dragon or seat and try to end the game. Call for goals like the Baron or the Elder Dragon when an enemy is dead and when your Ultimate t is standing. Use your Ultimate t to secure the goal for your team."}
{"text": "As twitch, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As rumble, Its e combined with its d can allow it to easily descend a single enemy target. The shield d allows it to mitigate a good amount of poke as well. Its Ultimate b makes it a threat during the team fights. The enemy team cannot afford to fight in closed spaces or they will certainly get shot by its Ultimate b. With a lot of haste and cooldowns reduced, it can gank so often and be on the whole map. This makes it a formidable Jungler."}
{"text": "As ornn, The proper location and spacing of the turret are essential to win this matchup. Make sure that Ornn can't put you against the ground either. Keep trapping him regularly in this matchup to hinder his full potential as much as you can. If he used his ult, and he's about to send the ram to you, CC him immediately. His ult will go to waste in this way. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy has no kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, His early game is pretty decent as he can just go for consistent all-in trades and get back to safety due to his y. He won't be taking a lot of damage either with proper usage of that ability.\n\nThe first item component is a decent spike as it bolsters his survivability and damage. It will help him take over the lane easily.\n\nLevel six is a massive spike as he can now impact team fights as a whole. He can also look for flanks and dive the enemy backline.        "}
{"text": "As brand, At the moment, it should focus on staying alive and not making itself CC'd and take off by the enemy team. Fighting around the bottlenecks is absolutely necessary because Brand will be quite effective with its Ultimate R. The ability will have a fairly short cooling, which will allow him to win team fights frequently. He should work with his team and set up death brushes around the map. His ability to blow up squishy targets completely will make the team fights very unfair for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As lux, Very immobile and can be killed almost immediately if she is caught out without her g. Layered CC will make her absolutely useless.\n\nShe is somewhat item reliant, so camping and killing her a lot during the early game will just make her a shield bot during the late game.\n\nShe can be picked off easily by the enemy team if she wanders too far from her team, or when she is trying to take the Blue Buff. She will also be very weak against complete all-ins from the enemy team."}
{"text": "As akali, At level 9, Akali would have maximized his Q. At this stage of the game, she will be able to erase the waves quickly and 1v1 most champions if they try to prevent him from cultivating in a side track. Once Akali reaches level 11, she will have 2 points in her Ultimate. She can look for more aggressive pieces and try to assassinate targets that are isolated or walk on the map by themselves. Since Akali is an Assassin, she should have some articles finished during the middle of the game. If you are able to catch someone who is alone, this could easily give rise to a potential call for the Baron."}
{"text": "As nautilus, To prevent all-in opportunities and decrease Nautilus's trading potential, keeping the wave closer to your side of the map is important as you can set up your Jungler.\n\nTry and track Nautilus's Ultimate cooldown post 6. It is important to do this as you don\u2019t want to be caught out by Nautilus's superior damage post 6.\n\nNautilus can all-in you at level 2. If you\u2019re not in a position to hit level 2 at the same time as them, back off so they cannot all in you and kill you.\n\nYou have the range advantage, so you must abuse it! Try to harass Nautilus with abilities and basic attacks whenever they walk up to last hit minions."}
{"text": "Against jayce, Jayce will use his range advantage to bring down the melee champions. Be ready to sacrifice some CS for XP when necessary. Although it has tons of poke, it has high mana costs. If you can, try to watch to fight when it is low on mana as it can not do a lot of combo when it is low. Make sure you are still behind the minion wave so the minions block its damage. Do not stay directly behind them as its s is AOE."}
{"text": "As fizz, Stay near your team in the late game. You shouldn\u2019t be too far away from them otherwise the enemy may force a fight or catch your team out of position. \n\nLook for picks with your Ultimate R in late-game fights. If you can pick someone off who steps too far forward, you can use the numbers advantage to start another team fight.\n\nGroup with your team in the late game, but try to stay hidden. This will allow you to get picks or initiate once the enemy walks too far forward or gets close to your team."}
{"text": "Against xayah, Once she is level 6, Xayah will have extra protection in lane as her Ultimate R can help her dodge damage. At this stage, it will be slightly harder for you to kill her whenever her Ultimate R is up.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Xayah will become. Try to set her behind in the early game so she isn\u2019t as useful in the mid and late game.\n\nWhen Xayah gets 2 items completed, her kill pressure and damage output will be very high. At this stage, it would be advised not to fight her unless you have a significant advantage in either damage or numbers."}
{"text": "As zyra, Prioritize poking down Zyra herself rather than her ADC, as she is generally squishy and easier to harass. By reducing her health, you can create pressure and limit her ability to freely use her abilities.\n\nMaintain the minion wave closer to your side of the map to create opportunities for your jungler to gank. This forces Zyra to overextend, making her more vulnerable to ganks and reducing her ability to escape effectively.\n\nBe cautious when facing Zyra at level 6, as her kill pressure significantly increases. Adjust your playstyle to be more defensive and play safer during this phase of the game.\n\nAvoid detaching from your ADC when Zyra's E ability (Grasping Roots) is up, as it can interrupt your W (You and Me!). Being caught without your W can leave you vulnerable and susceptible to being eliminated."}
{"text": "As varus, Avoid going for extended trades in this matchup as they will always win them.\n\nBeware of their strong level 6 all-in as they\u2019re really strong at level 6. \n\nSimilarly, beware of strong early trades with them. Stand back so they cannot harass you for free.\n\nFocus on farming and poking them in the early game. Try to match their pushing power and keep the minion wave slightly closer to your side of the map, but not under your tower."}
{"text": "Against aphelios, Stand outside of the minion wave as Aphelios does have a lot of AOE W damage. Additionally, stand away from the Tower if you\u2019re pushed under it as his AOE autos will hit you if you\u2019re behind the tower. \n \nDon\u2019t trade at level 1 with Aphelios if you\u2019re playing as an AP champion. He is AD based and will deal more damage than you early.\n \nAphelios is prone to crowd control and all-ins. If possible, try to lock him down as quickly as you can when trading to reduce his damage output. Aphelios is also super squishy and easy to kill, so he might even blow Flash when you try to engage."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As sion, Sion is weak in the game very early. He needs to get some levels behind him before he can start to gank. Post 6, Sion can gank files from far with his Ultimate R. Look for ganks every time your Ultimate R is up. Sion is the first peaks of game power depend on the construction he goes for: if he goes tank, he will be weaker early, if he will damage it will be heinous and strong."}
{"text": "As yorick, Peel for your carries in late game team fights to increase the chances of your team winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Extremely vulnerable once her E is on cooldown. It is her main defensive tool, which if used offensively, can allow the enemy team to all-in her and kill her (if she is too pushed up).\n\nIf a Caitlyn can\u2019t use her W in a proper way, she can\u2019t really be too effective in the laning phase. It takes some time to get used to placing the W traps, especially against enemies who have a form of a dash or blink in their kit.\n\nShe falls off massively during the mid-game as she is extremely reliant on critical strike chance to be able to dish out a lot of damage. Her counterparts can deal a lot of damage and have a lot of utility at this point due to their kits, which puts Caitlyn in quite a weak spot."}
{"text": "As briar, Your Ultimate is extremely strong. It is crucial that you be proactive with your Ultimate and gank every time your Ultimate is up as it will do exactly the same. It is stronger than you post 6. Keep your distance and run away if you find it alone. Make sure you make sure these Dragons so you can keep your team in the game! Counter-ranking Briar is really easy on this champion."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Quite vulnerable when his E is down. This can allow the enemy to all-in him and kill him quite easily during the early game.\n\nHis Ultimate R positioning can get him killed if his team doesn\u2019t follow up on him. Besides, going in too deep without any assistance can also get him killed.\n\nHe is quite useless if the enemy manages to steal his camps and set him back in terms of items. This will prevent him from doing damage and will make him a deadweight for his team."}
{"text": "As sett, It can be trapped to the oblivion, especially when it is against a varied range with some form of dash or coat. Misuse of its W can cause it to kill because it is its only form of mitigation of damage. It cannot escape easily if someone includes it after using this ability. If the enemy is intelligent, they will avoid regrouping during the fighting. This will prevent Sett from effectively using its Ultimate R, as it has not been able to land much damage or slow down several members of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As pyke, Level 16 is a massive peak for Pyke because the ability will now be higher almost every team fight. The damage done will be quite significant as well. Its ultimate R will be critical and effective during the fights. Squishies can be one blow, and it can pretty much kill several enemies at a time. It will have its important articles during this phase of the game which means that it will both inflict massive amounts of damage and survive the fights and heal quickly."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus will have a massive amount of stacks during this phase of the game. This can easily let him one-shot enemy carries who are un-peeled for by the enemy team.\n\nNasus' tankiness will be a force to reckon with as he legit won't die as long as he finds a target to use his Q on. This will provide his team with a reliable front liner.\n\nHis main power spike is during this phase of the game, as he will have multiple items, multiple stacks, and will be able to blatantly all-in and pick enemy champions off at his will."}
{"text": "As khazix, As you are good at getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Summon Rift alone. After killing someone, call for a close goal. Try to secure the Baron or Dragon whenever possible. Securing goals is the key as a Jungler during the middle of the game. Continue cultivating your jungle as well as gank and helping your allies."}
{"text": "As kalista, Her Passive prevents her auto-attacks from going through if the enemy drops vision in the fog of war/lane brushes. This can get Kalista killed if both the fighting parties are low on health.\n\nGetting CC\u2019d will definitely get her killed as she relies heavily on her mobility to kite around and win skirmishes. She is squishy, and getting CC chained will indefinitely lead to her demise.\n\nIf she uses her r improperly, she can easily miss a chance to score multiple kills in a short period. This will also give the enemy enough time to all-in her if she happens to be close by, and kill her."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Try to harass and catch her with your abilities before starting a team fight. She's pretty squishy. If she uses her W trying to block incoming skill shots, look to start a fight while he's on cooldown. Gwen will be divided pushing in the middle of the game. You can use the number advantage to take down or start a team fight in her team while she's elsewhere on the map."}
{"text": "As ornn, Ornn is really immobile so poking him down will be really easy. Just make sure that you don't let him CC you.\n\nPost six, you can easily prevent Ornn from ulting you by simply putting him to sleep using your ult.\n\nDuring team fights, make sure that you CC Ornn as much as possible. It will save your team from a world of pain and CC.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Use the fog of the war to install ganks on the enemy with your Jungler. Once you all-in, make sure to collect your blobs. Be very careful to get shot out during farming. The enemy can try to lure you in one all-in this way so have a plan of escape ready. See if you can gank other ways with your abilities. It will easily kill you or two. Keep the wave near your turn as long as possible. He will make his hell of life in this matchup."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Has to powerfarm early game and hence has no impact unless the enemy overextends or overstays. He will mainly focus on cleaning up during the early game.\n\nHis e can easily be interrupted by any form of hard CC. This can make tower dives risky and can get him killed almost instantly if he doesn\u2019t use the ability properly.\n\nCan\u2019t do much if the enemy team just disengages when his Ultimate r is active. Very susceptible to CC, so if the enemy saves their CC for him, he will die."}
{"text": "As naafiri, Your first power spike is at level 3 when you unlock all 3 of your basic abilities. You can start looking to fight at level 3 onwards.\n\nWhen you unlock your Ultimate, roaming and all-ins will be easier and you\u2019ll be more of a threat.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve completed your first component item, you\u2019ll be quite strong in 1v1s and have a higher chance of getting kills.\n"}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, In team fights, look for his Ultimate r. He can either use it to protect an ally, or catch someone out of position. Keep this in mind during fighting. Avoid stretching alone in the average track without your team as he can use his W to get on you and start a fight. Try to burst Tahm Kench before he is able to activate his E. CC is your best friend and he will not be able to activate it if it is locked with CC."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm needs to make sure that he activates his E mid-fight. Activating it too late is useless because the enemy will disengage, and you will waste the shield. It is very motionless, which means that it is really easy to pursue even with his W up. If the enemy freezes the way, he can do nothing to escape an all-in-one. As Tahm Kench is a champion of melee, the laning against various champions is very difficult for him because they can trap him whenever he moves or positions himself a little aggressively."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Concentrate them with your other front-line champions. As you are the Jungler, you must make sure that you are still alive in the late match. If you will die before a major goal scares, the enemy will be able to take it. Make sure that you are still on the side of the map that the next major goal is safe. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free."}
{"text": "Against ashe, Ashe is much stronger in the long skirmishes because it allows her to activate her Q in the trade. Do not go for prolonged trades with Ashe unless you can kill her. Once Ashe has her Ultimate w up, her ability to get kills increases. You have to respect her level 6 and respect her all-in whenever her Ultimate w is up. Ashe is very dependent on her Ultimate w as it can be used in various ways. Try to abuse her when her Ultimate w is on cooldown because she is incredibly vulnerable while he is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As lulu, Her late game is phenomenal as she can peel for her team for days. No one can come close to her team as long as her W and Ultimate R are up.\n\nLulu's Ultimate R at level 16 is a force to reckon with. It will be challenging for the enemy team to eliminate Lulu's team due to the short cooldown of the ability, and killing Lulu will really become next to impossible.\n\nLulu will be full build by this time in the game. Her shielding potential will be out of the world, and she can enable her entire team if she manages to use her abilities properly."}
{"text": "As shen, Able to mitigate any form of auto-attack damage with his W. This can make the enemy physical damage carries to be practically useless when this ability is active.\n\nHe can set really good cheese brushes as well as all-in opportunities with his E. When combined with certain items, Shen can put additional debuffs on the taunted champions with ease.\n\nHis Ultimate R can allow him to act as a guardian for his teammates. This becomes really beneficial if one of Shen\u2019s teammates is fed and needs to be peeled for."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton is one of the strongest early game champions in the game. You can use this advantage to gain a lead.\n\nHas tons of sustain in lane thanks to his e. The additional healing will make fights favoured as he can heal back some of the damage taken.\n\nOnce ahead, Renekton can constantly bully the enemy laner and over again and snowball his lead quickly. Make sure you keep playing around your cooldowns to further your lead."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 9, Ezreal maximizes his Q. He will be strong enough at this stage of the game thanks to the additional damage his Q will make and the items he would have picked up by then. Putting the second point in Ezreal, Ultimate R at level 11 will offer him a lot of additional damage. He will also be able to threaten the flights on major goals like Baron or Dragons. Ezreal is really good to bring down enemies before a fight thanks to its low temperature reductions and overall damage."}
{"text": "As swain, Focus on poking down Swain himself rather than his ADC, as Swain tends to be squishier and easier to harass. By reducing his health, you can create pressure and limit his ability to freely engage.\n\nMaintain the minion wave closer to your side of the map to create opportunities for your jungler to gank. This forces Swain to overextend, making him more vulnerable to ganks and reducing his ability to escape effectively.\n\nBe cautious when facing Swain at level 6, as his kill pressure significantly increases with the power of his ultimate. Adjust your playstyle to be more defensive and play safer during this phase of the game.\n\nAvoid detaching from your ADC when Swain's E ability (Nevermove) is up, as it can interrupt your W (You and Me!). Being caught without your W can leave you vulnerable and at risk of being eliminated."}
{"text": "As zyra, In the mid-game, teams will start grouping. Thanks to Zyra\u2019s AOE abilities, she will be rather good during this stage in the game as she will be able to deal damage to multiple enemy champions at once.\n\nZyra would\u2019ve also completed multiple items when the mid-game roles around. Because of this, your abilities will deal a lot more damage which will allow you to pick of squishy targets.\n\nAt level 9, Zyra would\u2019ve maxed either her Q or her E. Regardless of which one you maxed first, you should be able to deal a lot of damage to the enemy laner during the mid-game or the later parts of the laning phase."}
{"text": "As kled, Kled is really good early because he can use his Q and E for everything and destroy his enemy in the trades. His W also plays a central role in it. Once Kled touches level 6, he will have access to his Ultimate R, which will allow him to do everything in the corridors in different ways. He can even make a surprise visit to the bot track. The first element will increase Kled's duel potential. This will make him more powerful than he is already, which is terrible news for the enemy."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 11 is not great because it can only wander and play. It will reduce the cooldown but do nothing else when it comes to inflicting damage. It starts coming online in the middle of the game. Its burst damage is very important, and it can quickly get choices with its abilities. Its team fight is quite powerful as well as. Its first ability will be maximized at level 9."}
{"text": "As teemo, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing.

You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}

You have a lot of poke, so try to poke the enemy down as often as you can.\n\nPlay safe for the first few levels while you land poke on the enemy with your Q. Once they\u2019re low enough, you can commit to an all-in.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve hit level 6 and purchased key component items, look to harass and constantly push the enemy into their tower. This will allow you to earn turret plating and increase your gold income. "}
{"text": "As sona, With the constant use of this ability, Sona can force her trackers to suddenly remember and cause a setback in their plans. She swings like a truck and becomes extremely strong during the last game. It allows her to inflict respectable amounts of damage while healing and protecting her team for a good amount. Her Ultimate R can completely reverse the tides of a lost team fight. It will allow her team to look for an all-in-one as well, or win a skirmish on a goal."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Pantheon can duel almost all the Junglers in the game. A good Pantheon will constantly seek to invade the enemy and get murders. Pantheon's level 6 allows him to inflate his allies from afar. He can launch his Ultimate R from afar, which means that he will avoid and avoid shallow neighborhoods. His W offers him tons of pressure of choice throughout the game. Getting the right choice on someone can easily win you the game or team fight."}
{"text": "As karthus, Getting your core items will let you run down enemies and burn them to oblivion.

Your Ultimate t is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}

Use your W to help you scout for enemies so you don\u2019t have to face check them.\n\nLook for picks with your team on isolated targets. Catching out a key target could allow you to take the Baron."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Pantheon is a dominant early game champion. Expect that he will go for the early ganks to get an advance.

After Pantheon has finished his juggling, his death pressure is intensifying."}

Find a healthy balance between the ganking of your allies, farming your jungle and securing goals. Make sure you don't fall back in XP trying to gank constantly."}

If it bounces, he may look to all in you. Keep the wave outside of your Tower.\n\nIn the early game, try and keep trades short and sweet while keeping an eye on his bar if he is dismounted. Look for short-bursty trades rather than extended auto ones (regardless of mounted/dismounted status) as that is where Kled shines.\n\nKled's second Q applies grievous wounds, so try your best to escape the leash if his Q lands on you as it reduces your healing and survivability.

{"text": "Against jarvaniv, In the team fights, Jarvan IV will seek to lock as many champions as he can with his Ultimate m. Make sure you are grouped together as a team but not regrouped so closely together that he can lock everyone in his Cataclysm m. Jarvan gameplay is not very creative when it comes to fighting. Warding base areas like bushes or choking points will probably spot Jarvan before he has the chance to flank or gank.

The usage of this ability with her Ultimate R can allow her to chunk an enemy with ease, as the enemy won\u2019t be able to escape the ult radius quickly.\n\nHer Passive allows her to sustain off the damage she deals.

In the right matchup and with an all-in-one support, Tristana is really strong at level 2 or 3 when she has her W and can look for an early murder.

As Kayle becomes stronger than the game goes, you really need to finish the game as quickly as possible. If you can't finish the game and it arrives at the end of the game, you will find it difficult to win."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Nautilus has an incredibly strong level 2, make sure to hit Level 2 first and look for an aggressive game. Staying healthy is the key when you play Nautilus. If you get swiped down, you will never be able to commit. When you are waiting on your cooldowns, play safe and out of the automatic attack range. Use Nautilus, strong roaming capacity to move around the map and help your allies."}
{"text": "Against janna, If you're playing as a melee champion, try to minimize your overworked time while getting guard-hunting piles. She can wait until her m is up before trading. This model is pretty common against champions who can turn the fire when she's looking to trade. Use the cooldown m time frame for the poke. When you play as a melee champion, make sure Janna doesn't intimidate you with the basic attacks. When you can't commit, stand out and line up with your ADC so she can't harass and intimidate you."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks will look to gank more frequently when their Ultimate is up. Ensure you ward the enemy's jungle entrances so your team can spot the Jungler leaving their jungle with their Ultimate.\n\nFiddlesticks is a weak early game champion. This makes them vulnerable to invades by you and your team. Try to invade Fiddlesticks as much as possible.\n\nIf you see Fiddlesticks ganking or walking over a ward, try to invade their jungle and steal away their camps to delay their power spike.\n\nAs you\u2019re much stronger than Fiddlesticks early on, make sure to gain an early lead by ganking your allies before Fiddlesticks even gets a chance to come online.\n"}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. Trendamere has a lot of pressure to kill and if you push, it could easily all within you and you continue in the way. Look for fights when he has little Fury in his resource bar. The more Fury he has, the stronger he will be. Every time his Ultimate e is down, try to abuse cooldown and look for killers. Once his Ultimate e is up, his pressure of death and survival increases a lot."}
{"text": "As olaf, Avoid getting poked out by his Q in this matchup. Failing to do so will prompt Olaf to all-in you once you're low.\n\nIf you look for an all-in, make sure that you committ. Get some Grievous Wounds while you're at it for maximal effectiveness.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate you should be able to look for all-ins regularly. Just go in when his Q is down.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and ask your Jungler to gank as much as you can. It will allow you to get a lead easily."}
{"text": "Against camille, Try and stay closely grouped as a team when playing against Camille to make it very hard for her to engage. Camille will want to lock down an isolated target with her Ultimate R, but by standing close together it will reduce her ability to do so.\n \nCamille will often hunt vulnerable targets who are isolated walking around the map. Stick with your team to reduce Camille\u2019s assassination attempts.\n \nIn addition to grouping closely, Camille cannot easily get on to the backline by running at the enemy. Instead, she will try to flank from the side. So whenever you\u2019re sieging an objective or fighting in a lane, make sure you have sufficient ward coverage to the sides so you can spot her before she engages."}
{"text": "As diana, Diana can look for jobs from level 3 because she will have access to all 3 of her basic abilities. Try to go for aggressive games to gain an early health advantage. As Diana does a lot of bursting damage, she should look for constantly favorable jobs around her Q and t once she has taken her Mythic article. Don't be afraid to fight if you have the advantage of the article. Diana, level 6 is very strong. Her Ultimate R makes a lot of bursting damage and can be used to get dead again and again in the way. Because it is such a strong tool, you can also look at and help your allies if the enemy laner plays incredibly safe"}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, He can also continue to poach the opposition with his W and put some Q turrets in the track/round brushes to prevent everything. He can push freely until he is in the cover of his turrets Q. These turrets, when combined with his E, can allow Heimerdinger to transform an enemy gank into an easy killer for him. His ultimate R provides him with a lot of versatility. He can use his authorized Q to remove turrets and enemies, his W authorized to destroy weak enemies, and his E authorized to put a multi-man, long-range CC that can allow his team to follow his CC."}
{"text": "As aatrox, You are a very mobile champion, thanks to you E. It can be used in many ways and is a good way to revolve around exchanges with the enemy. You have tons of support thanks to your passive and Ultimate R. This will increase your survival in team fights and skirmishes. Aatrox has a good skirmish potential and can 1v1 most champions, especially if he can fight them when they have a ability on the cooldown."}
{"text": "As seraphine, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "As irelia, In the last game, continue to divide the push if your team is not at risk of dying or getting caught. If your team is going to get caught or if the game is not one way, you have to group with your team to help them fight. Play on the side of the card that has the next major goal up so that you can turn to take it with your team. Otherwise, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the card and use it to get it to your team."}
{"text": "Against lux, Lux will often wander on the map alone at the room. You can ambushe it and take it down before a major target spawns and then quickly take the goal after. Lux excels at catching enemies with his g. Make sure your team is grouped and nobody walks on the map alone as it can easily shoot them down. In team fights, try to engage as soon as possible. Lux will try to delay a team fight so that she can pee with her l or get a choice with her g."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level sixteen will be a massive spike as it will reduce the cooldown of his Ultimate t and increase his mushrooms' damage. Enemies will have a hard time traversing choke points now.\n\nHe will have a pretty high amount of Ability Haste now, which means that he can drop a lot more mushrooms around the map. The enemies will have to invest heavily in vision to keep themselves safe.\n\nHe will complete his build during this phase of the game, which will allow him to one-shot squishy targets. His t blind should come in handy during this phase of the game as well."}
{"text": "As olaf, Olaf is rather weak when his Ultimate k is down. He is quite motionless and inclined to CC layer. This makes him quite vulnerable post 6. If you miss your Axe t, your ganks will probably fail. You have to get as close as possible to the enemy so you increase your chances of landing them. He will fight against the range champions with dashes because they will be able to kite and avoid his Axes t."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Look at your positioning in the team fights that Morgana will try to catch someone with her Q. Make sure you are in an appropriate position so you can avoid. Do not stay too far forward or too far back. Once Morgana has gone fishing with her Q, she is relatively defenseless on which you can capitalize. As soon as she uses her Q, load her and try to get her off. Every time Morgana throws her Ultimate R in a team fight, try to get out of the area as fast as you can to not be chained and CC."}
{"text": "As amumu, During the mid-game, you will want to work with your Jungler towards securing picks. Your s will definitely let you pick off many enemies during this phase of the game.\n\nLook for flanks on the enemy team when possible. Ultimate y'ing the enemy backline can easily win your team the game.\n\nChokepoint fights are going to be preferable for you as your r and Ultimate y can definitely disrupt the enemy team. Play around vision to catch the enemy off-guard.        "}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, Try and burst Tahm Kench down, or CC chain him so he is unable to activate his E in the team fight. \n\nIn team fights, look out for his Ultimate r. He can either use it to protect an ally, or catch someone out of position. Keep this in mind when fighting.\n\nTahm can use his W to flank in a fight. When skirmishing with the enemy, ward your flanks as he may jump in and start a fight."}
{"text": "As ivern, Ivern does not deal any damage and is built as a secondary support. This means that he relies on his teammates more than most junglers in the game. It is better paired with a team that has a hyperportation. If you are paired with teams that lack damage or AP Bot dragpers, his healings and E shields will not be so effective. Ivern's porting potential is rather not easy. He relies on his team to be strong to do his job properly. If his team is behind, it will be difficult for him to win the game."}
{"text": "As amumu, The enemy has a good objective control. With this in mind, try and keep it kept at all times with a Control Ward at the back of the pit. This will help your team to know if they start the goal and if you are nearby, you could be able to collapse on them. You are much stronger than the enemy in 1v1. So, if you find them walking around the map or near the scuttle crab, you can fight them as long as you have a lot of health. Make sure to check the map to crush the sleds and to retreat if they come. If the enemy disembarks their CC, just back. As discussed, the enemy must hit Level 6 quickly to make full use of their kit. Try to invade them as much as possible and steal their camps to delay their level 6 peak power. A good time to invade is when the enemy Jungler shows up on the opposite side of the map."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Do not group closely together when sieging an objective or team fighting as it provides Gragas with an opportunity to knock your whole team into his with his Ultimate R.\n\nWhen fighting, make sure you\u2019re not too far forward or split from your team. If you\u2019re too far forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught out like this could result in the enemy taking an objective shortly afterwards. \n\nTry to constantly poke and harass Gragas. Having him on low health will prevent him from playing or positioning aggressively."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's early game prowess comes from his all-in combo. Hitting level 3 is a significant powerspike. Additionally, he will have both waveclear and a burst damage all-in combo at his disposal.\n\nGetting his boots is a decent powerspike for Galio. This is mainly because he can quickly shove the wave and roam to other lanes with the help of his Ultimate R. It will also allow him to return to the lane quickly.\n\nGalio is one of those champions whose level 6 isn't that big a power spike for himself. This is because it is a team-dependent Ultimate R, and hence Galio should try to compensate by looking to shove the wave in and then roam to his allies."}
{"text": "As camille, In the late game, Camille is good at picking off champions with her Ultimate R. It should be on a low cooldown and if you\u2019re able to Ult R the right champion (like a carry), you could win the game.\n\nWhile you have good pick potential, the enemy will start building defensive stats which will make it harder for you to kill the carries on your own. Keep this in mind when diving in with your E.\n\nAlthough you will find it harder to kill carries on your own, you will be quite tanky and deal a lot of damage thanks to the items you buy. Don\u2019t be afraid to jump in and soak up damage if you need to."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 11 is not a massive spike as it gives only a measly increase in the ability's damage. That being said, the lower cooldown certainly helps.\n\nPantheon is pretty decent during the mid-game. This is because he can dish out a lot of damage in a short time and can secure picks all around the map.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This means he can deal a massive amount of burst damage to any enemy he gets too close to."}
{"text": "As skarner, His first ability will be maxed out at level 9. It should bolster his survivability and damage in the game, and he should be able to make more picks now.\n\nSkarner\u2019s team fighting is phenomenal during this phase of the game. He can soak up damage while ensuring that he gets crucial picks on the enemy team.\n\nAt level 11, he would put a second point in his Ultimate. The reduced cooldown will help him make picks more frequently.\n"}
{"text": "As azir, You are extremely squishy and hence are really weak to all-ins from the enemy team. The danger increases when you don't have your Ultimate R ready.\n\nDue to your soldier positioning mechanic, any enemy champion who has a dash, or some other form of mobility spell, can prove to be a really hard target to catch out and kill for you.\n\nYour own mobility can turn out to be a weak point for you. If the enemy manages to bait out your R in an aggressive way and then the enemy Jungler shows up for a gank, you will have a really hard time getting out of the situation without your Ultimate R. "}
{"text": "As poppy, Can easily be kited by ranged carries even without using their dashes. Her Q can easily be sidestepped as it has a very short range.\n\nCan be killed easily if she overextends with her E. She also acts as a frontline so the enemy can flank her teammates before going for her.\n\nMisuse of her Ultimate R can land both her and her team in huge trouble. This is especially true if the enemy team has some sort of heavy engage which can get on her team\u2019s carry."}
{"text": "As trundle, In the jungle, focus on getting level 3 as quickly as you can. Your h will be really useful during duels, so use it properly.\n\nFighting around chokepoints can allow you to separate enemies from their teammates. Your e and e should let you block the enemy and run them down.\n\nNeutral objectives need to be secured by you constantly. You are really good at doing so; hence make sure you try to secure some of the other objectives after a gank.        "}
{"text": "As volibear, He is countered really hard by Grievous Wounds as it prevents him from healing by a lot, thereby reducing his tower dive and all-in potential.\n\nBeing scattered in a team fight will prevent him from getting a massive Ultimate R off, and changing the tide of a team fight. His trading power is lower when his Ultimate R is on cooldown.\n\nHis main goal is to get a lead early on by ganking constantly. Proper vision set-up can counter this, forcing him to play a more farm-oriented Jungle style, which will ultimately hamper his potential."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Forcing a fight or fighting when Swain isn\u2019t around will make it easier for your team to win team fights.\n\nAvoid grouping to closely around objectives or in team fights as it may allow Swain to land a really good multi-person E and start the team fight.\n\nBurst and poke is the best way of winning a fight against Swain. Try to poke him down before a team fight starts. When he activates his Ultimate R, burst him down so he is unable to dish out lots of damage."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes a lot of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You have to play a lot to make use of her kit. While Camille is incredibly mobile thanks to her E, every time he is on the cooldown, she is very vulnerable and easy to take. Before entering, make sure to check your environment as you do not have an escape when your E is down. As it is mechanically difficult, it is really easy to get wrong on her. If you make a mistake, the enemy can easily capitalize on her and win an advance. Once Camille is behind it, it will be difficult for her to return to the game."}
{"text": "Against sion, The longer the game goes, the stronger Sion will become. Depending on his build path, he will peak at different items.\n\nSion is strong at level 6 as he can quickly gank lanes from out of vision. Deeper vision will be needed to reduce his effectiveness.\n\nAt level 9, Sion would\u2019ve maxed his Q. His all-in potential and strength when ganking will be very high."}
{"text": "As swain, His early game is excellent as he can completely CC and blow up an enemy target when required. Using it from the lane brushes will allow him to reap a lot of benefits.\n\nLevel six is an excellent spike as he can now control the pace of a team fight. He can easily be in between the enemy team while dealing a lot of health and regenerating a lot of health in return.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities frequently and dish out a lot of damage. It helps a lot with his overall laning prowess."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Try to delay team fighting as long as possible while you push the enemy down with your E Barrels. Getting a good Barrel E off can help you win the fight. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's a very important ability and you need to make sure it's high before you engage in a fight."}
{"text": "As vladimir, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As teemo, Use the track brushes to get a edge on the enemy sleds. You can easily poke them with your t and self-attacks that you will be hidden. If the enemy lantern wanders, do not bother trying to challenge their roam. Instead, push the minion wave and start winning the gold turret. You will want to enigma the track brushes with your t Ultimate and use them as cover to continue cutting your opposition. It should be easy enough to do during early play."}
{"text": "As thresh, Thresh is a dominant track support. This means that he can often win the way and win the game just by getting himself killed. He has great potential of choice thanks to his Q. A good Q hook in the middle of the game could snowball in a huge advantage. Thresh has tons of roaming pressure. This allows him to impact several tracks and advance his allies."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo may not join the team fights because it is not very good in them. Rather, it can be split pushing and trying to take targets in the side lanes. Make sure someone is able to prevent it from dividing. Teemo will place the mushrooms t around the lenses and in the areas of great circulation. Avoid going anywhere that Teemo has recently been in without a scanning lens. He and his teammates can be ready and wait and try to launch you. As Teemo will be cracked pushing or away from his team during the fights, you could use the advantage of numbers to force a 4v4 or 5v4 fight."}
{"text": "Against garen, Garen's construction path can be very different from one game to another. Keep an eye on its itemization and play according to what it buys. If it's in full damage, you probably haven't been able to fight it alone. It will be difficult for Garen to engage or start a team fight because it lacks hard CC. This means that he will try to flank in team fights with his Q. Make sure that you keep your side at all times and kite upside down as soon as it appears. Avoid losing valuable resources like Summoner Spells or Ultimates on Garen unless you are sure you are able to kill it. Garen can quickly complete his health bar full thanks to his Passive that will lead your team to lose on key spells for the rest of the fight."}
{"text": "As sett, It can accumulate a lot of damage during this phase of the game because it will have all its articles, which will make it really strong. It will now be a front liner quite reliable for its team. A maximum-out Ultimate R will be on the rise frequently, and the following team fights will become a breeze during this part of the game. It is a decent team fighter during this phase of the game. It can regenerate its health quickly because of its passive and its real damage will melt through the enemy health bars."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, This is the period of the game where you will want to work with your Jungler to get picks on the enemy champions. This will let you prevent a lot of skirmishes and will set the enemy team back massively.\n\nRoaming and helping your other laners to secure picks is crucial to winning the game. Make sure that you only all-in if you have your allies nearby. Else you will just end up dying.\n\nDuring neutral, objective fights, you must zone the enemy off the objective pit. If they get close to you, use your Ultimate m to stop the enemies in their track."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is really good at the end of the game. His abilities will hit like a truck due to his articles. His Ultimate e will be pivot to win the game. Once he gets 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will allow him half-healthy enemies squishy easily. This means that all those behind the enemy team will suffer a lot. At this stage of the game, Karthus would have maximized his 1 and e. His release of damage in the team fights will be very high."}
{"text": "As zilean, His QW Q combo can help him to stun a group of enemies that is very beneficial in near-quarter combat. His ladders are high enough so that he can do a lot of damage through this combo. His Ultimate t, when used correctly, is one of the most odious and overcharged abilities in the game. This combined with his p can make one of his doors almost uncatchable and uncontrollable. His p allows him to guarantee a QW Q hit on a specified target. This can be very beneficial in setting up a death brush before a major objective fight."}
{"text": "Against kalista, Extended trades work in the Kalista\u2019s favour. Try to keep trades short and sweet so she cannot deal tons of damage with her r.\n\nKalista will have the range advantage against all melee champions. Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP to stay alive in lane.\n\nTake note on who Kalista has been paired with. In many cases, this will either be the Support or Jungler depending on the situation."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Focus on poking and chipping on Seraphine's health bar, and force her to use her mana up. Once that is done, you can push her out of the lane with ease.\n\nGet some Grievous Wounds as quickly as you can in this matchup. It will give you a massive edge during the early game.\n\nBe a part of as many neutral objective fights as you can in this matchup. Your AoE based abilities can yield a lot of advantage for you.\n\nPushing is allowed in this matchup as it will give you a significant advantage. Take the enemy tower down quickly."}
{"text": "As kalista, Kalista's level 11 doesn't give her a significant peak, but it's an advantage for her ally Oathbound. Her ability to protect them from all-en-bout\u00e9s or get them to throw them all-in for the team increases a thousand folds. At level 9, she should have her first maximum ability. Most of the time, it will be her r, which will give her a boost of massive damage and allow her to take unwavering goals. Kalista is remarkable in the middle of the game. It's mainly because she can get a lot of damage with her auto-attacks and Passive while her team is peeling for her. Her Ultimate x also helps her set-up to engage."}
{"text": "As trundle, Extremely reliant on teammates to pull off successful ganks which may sometimes force him to power farm and be ineffective during the early game.\n\nAlthough his Ultimate n can allow him to steal stats, he is still weak without items and can be shut down early on if the enemy Jungler or laner manages to kill him once or twice.\n\nHe can be easily kited by ranged carries once his e has been used up. This either forces him to back off or die, if Trundle happens to overextend without any followup from his team."}
{"text": "As zac, At level 9, Zac's first ability will be maximized. He will now be able to all-in his enemies from afar and inflict a significant amount of damage at the same time. Once he reaches level 11, he can have two points in his ultimate R. This increases the frequency with which he can use the ability and, therefore, will also increase his potential of choice. Zac will have his basic elements during the middle of the game. This will make him almost unqualified, and he will be able to create several choices during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "As zac, Use the lane brushes to score knockup on the enemy laner whenever possible.

{"text": "As hecarim, Its increased speed of motion on its p can allow it to run down enemies with ease. This is particularly applicable to immobile carriers who rely on their team to live. The h allows it to inflict constant damage while reducing its cooling on capacity. This allows it to take extended jobs while launching, as well as, while juggling. This combined with its choice of rune can make it so. Its Ultimate t can be a game change in a team fight where the enemy is grouped. The CC allows it to separate key targets from their team and kill them quickly with its damage."}
{"text": "Against garen, Deny Garen\u2019s Passive by auto-attacking him whenever possible. This will reduce his sustain in lane and make killing him easier.\n \nGaren\u2019s E deals extra damage to lone targets. You can mitigate the damage by fighting beside your minions. They will also start focusing him if he auto-attacks you.\n \nTry and stay at max distance at all times against Garen. This will reduce his all-in potential. Additionally, by standing at the maximum distance possible, he will have to waste his Q to get in range of you to trade. You can capitalise on this and look to trade with him while it\u2019s on cooldown."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen will gain a huge power spike and finishing ability once he manages to get to level 6. This will let him go for regular short burst trades against his enemies, let his Passive kick in after the trade, and then go for the finish with his Ultimate R after getting the enemy low. In addition, using the lane brushes to conceal Garen's approach will further solidify his position in the lane.\n\nGaren's first item component will either let him survive the lane for a more extended time (tank build) or increase his damage significantly (bruiser build). The former will let him take part in many team fights while the latter will help him with duels.\n\nGaren's build will dictate how he plays the game out. If he goes for the tank build, he will be nearly unkillable and can act as a perfect peel unit for his carries. On the other hand, if he goes for the bruiser build, he will be more dependent on the fog of war to catch enemies off guard and pick vital enemy carries."}
{"text": "Against briar, As an assassin, she will look to take down targets walking around the rift alone or too far forward and away from their team. Stick together and force fights when she isn\u2019t there.\n\nExpect her to flank from afar in team fights.

{"text": "Against diana, Once Diana reaches level 6, she can start receiving ganks from her Jungler as her Ultimate R deals a lot of damage and is CC. With this in mind, try to monitor the river and side bushes to spot the enemy Jungler before they appear in your way. Every time Diana lands her Q, she could look for all-in thanks to the reset on her t. Try and play safer when her Q landed and wait for him to disappear before walking forward. Diana is rather weak if she doesn't get killed early."}
{"text": "As zac, Once you get your first element, you should be able to extend the duration of your fights. Just make sure that you keep the river because you will be ruined differently.

Getting your ultimate R will allow you to be part of many team fights."}

It reduces the chances of the enemy team securing the Dragon or Baron, especially if Kalista's team managed to win a fight but lost their Jungler.\n\nHer team fighting style should revolve around staying behind her front line at all times and not getting caught out. Staying in the middle lane and getting priority in that lane should help her team immensely, especially when a neutral objective is about to come up. This will also help her if a skirmish breaks out as her team won't be under the threat of losing their middle lane while taking an extended trade."}
{"text": "As kled, If Kled is against a remote match, he did not succeed from the farm safely while being dismantled. Missing his E will make it really easy for the enemy carried for the kite out. If he goes with his W on cooldown, he has won more effective than he should be in an all-in-one. If he uses his Ultimate R and the enemy manages to cut off his team from him, then he did not win any form of follow-up and his team will have lost their front line. This will cause a lot of harm and could cause a loss of team combat."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ezreal\u2019s first power spike is when he picks up Sheen. His Q damage will increase substantially and he will look to constantly poke. \n \nOnce Ezreal has completed his Manamune and upgraded it to Muramana, his damage output and sustain will be much higher.\n \nWhenever Ezreal has his E, he is much safer and harder to kill. Try to abuse the cooldown whenever you can."}
{"text": "As alistar, Alistar has a limited range. With a good enemy positioning, it can be incredibly difficult for him to engage. Unfortunately, Alistar relies on his team more than some other Supports. Before engaging with his combo, he must make sure that his team is close and ready to follow. Once he has entered, it is difficult for Alistar to escape unless he has Flash. Even with his tanky statistics, he is vulnerable in a team fight."}
{"text": "As jhin, It is important that you stay with your team in the late game. Do not move around the card or go anywhere unless someone is with you. Stand back from your team near your support. Avoid walking too far from anyone in the late game. Being caught will lead the enemy will be able to push his advantage and finish the game. Look at your positioning in the late game. Focus on the kiting and automatic attack of the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so that you are not taken out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "Against veigar, The more the game goes, the stronger Veigar will be thanks to unlimited stacking with its e. End of the game as fast as you can. Veigar is quite weak and vulnerable in early play. You could try to abuse it to put it behind and miss it on the piles. Once Veigar has its Ultimate R, its death pressure increases. Keep in mind that it will do a lot of extra damage at this time."}
{"text": "As zyra, In the late game, your build should be coming to completion. While you will deal a considerable amount of damage, it will be harder for you to one-shot targets as the enemy team would\u2019ve started to pick up defensive items.\n\nAt level 16, Zyra will put the final point in her Ultimate R. The utility and damage this ability provides at this rank is very good, and she will be a menace in team fights.\n\nThanks to her low cooldowns and plants, Zyra will help her team quickly secure neutral objectives such as the Baron or Elder Dragon. Don\u2019t be afraid to make the call for these objectives if your team\u2019s in a position to do so."}
{"text": "As anivia, If you are taken out of position, the enemy may be able to finish the game. You must make sure that your Passive is up in the team fights to increase your chances of winning. Against the pushes of the enemy team is a must in the game late. Stick with your team and use your Ultimate m to prevent the enemy from sitting targets. This will make it difficult for them to destroy your Level 3 rounds. Keep your wall e out of cooldown at any time in case you need to use it to disrupt the enemy or interrupt a engagement. If you use it in the game late, you will be vulnerable."}
{"text": "Against draven, Draven is an early game monster with his g and can snowball easily if he gets an early kill thanks to his Passive.\n \nOn Draven\u2019s first back, he will usually get an expensive AD item. If you do not buy the exact same item as him, he will always come out ahead of trades. Take note of his first item and be prepared to play safer.\n \nAt level 6, Draven will look to go for kills if he hasn\u2019t got any already with the help from his Ultimate t. Respect his all-in potential and play safer when you\u2019re low."}
{"text": "As senna, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. However, you will rely on your Support to do the heavy lifting early on. \n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level 3 is a decent powerpike because Heimerdinger will have access to all its capabilities. It can easily ADC still CC and explode them with its turrets and rockets. It can also use the track brushes to catch enemies out of sight with its W or E. Level 6 is probably a massive power peak for Heimerdinger. It can now bait enemies to their death with ease. It can also take laps very quickly or slow several enemies with its E. The first mythical element will allow Heimerdinger to deposit a ton of damage of poke in the track with its turrets. Its burst damage will also be quite powerful, and it can a-shot enemies with the greatest ease."}
{"text": "As lucian, Lucian's level 2 is a decent power spike as it allows him to go for a devastating all-in combo. The damage dealt is relatively high, and he can quite quickly kill the enemy with multiple combo rotations.\n\nLevel six is a significant powerspike, especially when Lucian is against an immobile carry. He should have an easy time clearing waves with it as well if he needs to recall.\n\nThe first item will be a massive power spike for Lucian as it allows him to deal a lot of damage. It will give him an inherent advantage, especially if he can capitalize on his level two power spike.        "}
{"text": "As teemo, He can roam around the map and place his Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow him to block off enemies when taking neutral, objective fights or steal them with well-placed Ultimate ts.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let him deal hefty amounts of burst damage and will let him kill his enemies quickly. The squishier enemies will have a tough time as he can camp those lanes after clearing his Jungle quickly.\n\nHe isn't outstanding in team fights, so he should either resort to securing picks and blowing people up with his abilities or just split pushing till the enemy responds to him.        "}
{"text": "As teemo, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Make sure you're still standing behind a minion at any time to make it harder for him to land his Q and push you down. The best time to go for trades and kicks on Ezreal is when his E is on the cooldown. If he's using it aggressively, try to abuse cooldown and look for an aggressive game while he's defenseless. If Ezreal uses his Ultimate R to sniper someone on the map, ping your team while he's moving through Summoners Rift. This will help them avoid incoming ability. Although this ability is on the cooldown, you could look to play aggressive and try to fight it."}
{"text": "As teemo, Its passive can be really heinous to manage, especially when it hides in a brush and moves in and out while peeling its laner with its ts and ts. It is the jerk of the ADC sector as its t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the efficiency of the portage for a while, which gives its team some time to engage/disengage freely. The Ultimate t can act as a substitution to the vision, as well as do a lot of damage when it is kept in the right places."}
{"text": "As kennen, Focus on agriculture and scaling. Kennen needs time to come online and if you go for a bad trade or fall behind, you will fight to be useful later. If your bot track turns to the upper side after getting the first lap, turn to the lower lane and start on the farm instead. Use your range and energy advantage to get an early lead. Try harassing the enemy champion as often as possible."}
{"text": "As warwick, Once Warwick manages to get the third point into his Ultimate R, he will be ganking and picking enemies off throughout the map. Any immobile enemy will be highly unsafe now.\n\nWarwick will deal a lot of damage while being extremely tanky along with it. This means that he can both serve as an engager as well as a peeler for his team.\n\nAt level 14, two of his abilities will be completely maxed out. This will be an augmentation to his overall gank potential, and Warwick will benefit significantly from it."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Her first back is when she gets her initial power peak. Until then, Miss Fortune should play safely and should just try to land her ricochet t on the enemies behind the weak health minions. Level six is a massive power peak as it allows Miss Fortune to impact the fighting massively. It is also a decent finishing movement, especially in tight fighting."}
{"text": "As vex, Vex has a shield on its W that can protect it from incoming damage. Very good clear wave with its Q and E. Great potential to pick with its Ultimate R that can also be used to help its trip to other ways."}
{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze\u2019s laning phase is when he is at his weakest. Avoid trading with him too much in the very early game as he will just want to recall early and get his Tear anyway. \n\nWhen Ryze hits level 6, his kill pressure doesn\u2019t increase as his Ultimate R is not a damaging tool. For most champions, your level 6 will be stronger than his.\n\nTry to fight as often as possible. Ryze needs time to scale, so delaying his ability to scale is key. Getting an early kill and putting him behind early will reduce his ability to scale into the mid and late game."}
{"text": "Against sona, Catching Sona out when she goes to ward will allow your team to potentially allow you to take the Baron, Dragon or start a team fight when she is unable to protect her team.\n\nAvoid team fighting in areas where you\u2019re forced to group close together like inside an objective pit or in the jungle. This will allow Sona to get a multiperson Ultimate R. Try and group but not too close together.\n\nA good Sona will be stood near the back of her team when her Flash is down. This will make it harder for you to kill her in a team fight. To make killing her easier, try to flank her from the side or from behind."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Xin Zhao is an early game Jungler and will look to gank often in the early game. You can reduce his effectiveness in the early game by placing vision around his jungle entrances. \n\nOnce Xin has completed Trinity Force and his jungling item, he will be very strong. Avoid fighting him if you run into him alone at this stage of the game. In particular, once he has unlocked his Ultimate R.\n\nXin Zhao falls off in the late game or when champions start grouping and getting defensive items. "}
{"text": "As jhin, Try to keep keep the wave either in the middle of the lane, or keep pushing him into his turret so you can gain a good CS lead.\n\nAt level 6, Jhin is stronger than you in the 2v2. But if he activates his R, run into him to force him to cancel it.\n\nFocus on farming early so you can get some CS and gold under your belt. When you have your first item, look to play more aggressive.\n\nStand away from low health minions, especially when he has his Q up. Similarly, back off a bit when he has his 4th shot locked and loaded."}
{"text": "As rakan, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nLook for picks during the mid-game. If you can pick someone off with the help from your allies, you can abuse their death timer to earn more gold and possibly take a tower, an objective or get more kills."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Pyke is strong at level 1 and 2. Ensure you hit level 2 at the same time or before him to reduce his ability to get an early kill.\n\nOnce Pyke hits level 6, his kill pressure increases as his Ultimate R is an execute. Back away when low so he is unable to kill you and snowball his lead.\n\nPyke is really good at roaming. Once he has Mobi Boots, expect him to roam around the map and assist his allies. Ping whenever he goes missing."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is really good during the late game. His abilities will hit like a truck due to his items. His Ultimate e will be pivotal to winning the game.\n\nOnce he gets 3 points in his Ultimate e, it will allow him to half-health squishy enemies easily. This means that anyone who is behind on the enemy team will suffer a lot.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Karthus would've maxed his 1 and his e. His damage output in team fights will be very high."}
{"text": "Against leblanc, Leblanc can go for bursty trades in the early game as soon as she unlocks her Q and W. She can also proc Electrocute very easily with her Q W AA combo.\n\nOnce Leblanc hit\u2019s level 6, her kill pressure intensifies as her Ultimate R is very versatile. It also has a very short cooldown, so play respectfully. \n\nLeblanc is very strong in the mid-game once she has lots of AP and items. Make sure you group with your team so she cannot burst anyone down quickly."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, You should still focus on getting picks on the enemy carry when possible. Your d > e makes up for a perfect combo, and you should try to knock up multiple targets with it when possible.\n\nYour Ultimate m will have a very short cooldown now. This means that you can all-in the enemy team frequently and should be able to secure multiple picks with your Jungler and other teammates.\n\nYour items should make you really tanky during this phase of the game. Be very careful, though, as you don't want to all-in the enemy and find that you have no form of follow-up damage available. Focus on protecting your allies first, then look for an all-in."}
{"text": "As trundle, Trundle's first games are pretty good because it can increase its overall motion speed and block the escape route of the enemy it aims at, level 6 is a massive power peak because it allows it to temporarily steal statistics from its target. The stronger the enemy target, the better it is for Trundle. The first element will allow it to increase its potential of duel and survival in the game."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Look for choices during the middle of the game to get your team before. Get a choice here or there or blow an enemy Summoner Spell may be more than enough to get a goal nearby. You can look for opportunities from lane gank your laners to help them move forward. Only when you are ahead however, otherwise your laner will easily take your turn. During the fighting, make sure you use the fog of war to your advantage and continue to flank the enemy team. It will help you to cut down tons of damage and allow you to take a key target."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Hecarim spikes at level 6 as that allows him to unlock his Ultimate t which is a great duelling tool which will help him win team fights and 1v1\u2019s.\n\nHe is a snowball heavy champion and can easily get ahead just from a kill or two. Try to not feed him or gift him kills as he can quickly snowball out of control.\n\nWhen Hecarim completes Trinity Force, his duelling power intensifies. Avoid 1v1s with him unless you\u2019re ahead.

{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia runs out of mana incredibly quickly if she spams her E when trading. She needs to keep a constant eye on her mana pool otherwise she will have minimal lane pressure.\n\nCassiopeia is one of the most immobile champions in the game. This makes her a prime target for ganks and teams with good dive potential.\n\nWhen against mobile champions like Talon, Lee Sin, Rengar, it will be really hard for her to land her Q, make use of her W and escape a trade. She struggles against fast-moving enemies."}
{"text": "As teemo, His Passive can be really obnoxious to deal with, especially when he is hiding in a brush and moving in and out while pelting his laner with his t and t.\n\nHe is the bane of ADC mains as his t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the effectiveness of the carry for a while, which gives his team some time to engage/disengage freely.\n\nThe Ultimate t can act as a substitution for vision, as well as deal a lot of damage when kept in the right spots.

{"text": "Against akshan, The first power peak of Akshan is when he unlocks the 3 basic abilities. Although, his early play damage is pretty good at level 1 and 2. When he unlocks his Ultimate at level 6, his death pressure increases. Keep this in mind and avoid staying in the way when weak. After Akshans first return, he should have taken a component element for his Myth. Unless you've matched him, be careful because he will win jobs and all-in."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Kassadin is weak early because he cannot get too close to his opponents to shoot them down. It is mainly because of a lack of mobility and articles until he reaches level 6. To compensate, he should play safely and rely on the correct configuration of the vision to not die often. At level 6, Kassadin will unlock his Ultimate k. It is his first significant peak of power that he can now move away from an enemy according to the given situation. As the game progresses, this ability will play a central role in Kassaddin's success. Once Kassaddin has his first element, he should inflict a lot of brilliant damage to his enemies."}
{"text": "As reksai, It is very easy to kite because it has a small range and is a champion of melee. It will fight to kill mobile ADCs in team fights. If it goes full of damage, it will be very squishy and die easily in team fights. This can make this construction path rather risky to go. Hard to master. Rek-Sai is not as easy as many players think. You will need to put in a lot of practice if you want to master this champion!"}
{"text": "As camille, A good Camille will be able to play around her Ultimate R regularly. Once you have a second point in it, you should be able to get more killers with it. Make sure you constantly look for the coins every time your Ultimate R is up. At level 9, you will maximize your Q. At this stage of the game, your potential 1v1 is incredibly high. Don=t be afraid to look for 1v1 fights. You will have several completed elements in the middle of the game. After your first article, you will be much stronger, and when you have 2, you will be a fierce opponent."}
{"text": "As swain, Very motionless and weak at the beginning of the laning phase. It is especially true if he is confronted with a champion who can all-in and CC him.

He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he has won."}
{"text": "As ashe, Ashe will secure many picks during this phase of the game, thanks to all her slows and CC in her kit. She will need to work closely with her Jungler while ensuring that she positions correctly during fights.\n\nDue to her core items, Ashe will be able to duel quite effectively now. Using her y slow and Ultimate w, she should try to keep the enemy at arm's length while she keeps pelting them with her attacks.\n\nThe usage of her k will be pretty vital as she will easily be able to scout around the neutral, objective pits before a significant fight. This will prevent her from getting unnecessary deaths while she is setting up vision.        "}

It is effortless for Vayne to bamboozle the enemies now due to her invisibility.\n\nThe first item component will surely give Vayne a massive boost in dueling.
