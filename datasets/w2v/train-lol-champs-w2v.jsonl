{"text": "As twitch, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies forward. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure to try to exploit your early advantage. Look to secure the goals whenever they're. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes. Find a healthy balance between your allies, farming your jungle and security goals. Make sure you don't fall back in XP trying to gank constantly."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Morgana is a good early game Jungler. Expect her to go for frequent ganks. She can start ganking after level 3.\n\nMorgana\u2019s level 6 power spike is quite potent as she can lock you down for a long period of time with her Q and Ultimate R.\n\nAfter Morg has completed her first item, her damage output will be extremely high. Dodging her Q in a skirmish with her will be incredibly important."}
{"text": "Against darius, Try to disengage and kite Darius when he engages in a team fight. Try not to let him ride to you or your allies as he can inflict tons of damage if he is within range to shoot e in. For AD champions, invest in an Executioner. Calling will help reduce his healing and survival in team fights. Do not stay in a team fight when you are low as you could put Darius for a Pentakill with his Ultimate e."}
{"text": "As anivia, Anivia doesn't have a peak at levels 2 or 3 like most champions. That's because she's weak in the early game and needs a lot of time to come online. But, that doesn't mean that landing a t will not be impacted. Once Anivia has finished her first component, her pressure to kill and the ability to trade with the enemy will increase. This is not a bad option to play a little safe early and then play more aggressive after your first back. When Anivias Egg is down, you have to play a little safe and avoid overextend. You are an easy target for the ADC and Support enemy if you overextend while it goes down."}
{"text": "As khazix, Once the CC, its squishiness allows it to be an easy target to remove. The incorrect use of its E can cause it to kill several times. The use of capacity needs discretion, as it can prevent it from resetting itself that can inadvertently kill it. Kha==Zix will need a sufficient vision around isolated champions because the enemy can sometimes try to lure him, and collapse on him as soon as he shows up."}
{"text": "Against yorick, Pay particular attention to Yorick Graves. If he has 3 or more, he can scare them in the Ghouls. Avoid fighting him when there are a few. Yorick fights in early play. Keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map in early play will make it harder for him to get the farm and carry in the late game. If you are ever caught in his W, self-attack the walls as quickly as you can. Avoid fighting him inside him and be ready for Flash if you are weak."}
{"text": "Against olaf, Olaf is incredibly strong in early play: especially at level 1. Avoid fighting him at any cost as he will beat you if he is able to land several t. If Olaf throws his t and he is close to you, try your best to zone him away from the thrown Axes t so he is unable to pick them up. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to reduce his ability to everything within you and keep you down."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Once Jarvan maximizes his first ability to level 9, he will be able to inflict a fairly decent amount of damage. His all-in potential will also see a significant increase depending on the ability he has decided to max first. The level 11 achievement is another important peak of power for Jarvan IV, as his ability to all-in reliably will increase a thousand folds. He will have a reduced cooling and will inflict a heavier amount of damage. His ability to pick up enemies during this phase of the game is massive. He can try to invade the jungle of the enemy with his Jungler and see if he can get some peaks there. His all-power potential will be quite powerful during the battles piled up as well."}
{"text": "As ekko, You are a good ganker early. Make sure you equal his ganking pressure early on.\n\nFocus on securing those objectives. It is important that you try to take those objectives whenever possible to give your team a lead.\n\nOnce Ekko goes in, he doesn\u2019t have much left. So you can abuse this as you\u2019re a good counter ganker.\n\nPlaying around your Ultimate is crucial in this matchup. Try to make plays whenever you have your Ultimate available to you."}
{"text": "Against yuumi, Yuumi\u2019s R has quite a big area of effect. Do not look to team fight if her R is up inside the jungle or around an objective as she will be able to slow many champions and heal her team. Try to fight her in open areas where your team is not grouped to closely.\n\nYuumi\u2019s play style allows her to jump onto any member of her team if they\u2019re nearby. If the enemy looks to be engaging, back off as soon as they play aggressively especially if Yuumi is attached to the frontline as she will empower them.\n\nIf Yuumi is in a bad position, try to kill her. She has no mobility without her allies nearby and therefore can be punished very quickly."}
{"text": "As swain, Remember to take as many neutral, objective fights as you possibly can. Your Ultimate R and E will help you massively with it.\n\nSince you will be diving into the enemy team, you will want to get a defensive item like a Zhonya's Hourglass. This will let you use your Ultimate R effectively.\n\nYou will need to take care of your backline and see that they don't get doved and killed. If an assassin is trying to kill them, E the assassin immediately.        "}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, The string sticks will try to gank more frequently when their Ultimate is up. Make sure to keep the enemy's jungle entrances so that your team can spot the Jungler leaving their jungle with their Ultimate. Fiddlesticks is a weak early game champion. This makes them vulnerable to invasions by you and your team. Try to invade string sticks as much as possible. If you see Fiddlesticks crashing or walking on a hall, try to invade their jungle and steal their camps to delay their power peak. As you are much stronger than Fiddlesticks early, make sure to get an early lead by gaunting your allies before Fiddlesticks even has a chance to come online."}
{"text": "As sett, At level 11, Sett will have two points in his Ultimate R. This will increase his damage output, and his ability to fight against tanky teams will increase drastically.\n\nHis pick potential is really high during this phase of the game. This is because his E will allow him to set up death brushes inside the enemy jungle. This will help him get rid of any unsuspecting enemy who happens to pass by that brush.\n\nHis team fight presence is really high. This is mainly because of his W and Ultimate R. He should be able to burst down enemies with his W's true damage aspect in choke points.        "}
{"text": "As camille, If Camille tries to poke you with her W, you can try to dash in with your E and stab her with your empowered auto attack if looks like an optimal trade. The outer range of the W deals extra damage, and has a heal and a slow, while the inner range of the W does not slow or heal Camille.\n\nIf Camille does happen to land an E on you and you want to all in her, cast your Ultimate right before she stuns you so you do not waste any time casting your Ultimate outside of the stun. You can gain the bonus AD and healing earlier in the fight which may make all the difference.\n\nCamille's Passive shield duration does not outlast your Q recast window. You should hold your Q and wait for her Passive shield to fall off before re-engaging. You will not heal off of her shield as well, so do not waste your Passive empowered auto on it.\n\nWhen Camille uses her E to engage on you, do not try to dodge it and make your movements very linear, and at the last moment use your E in the opposite direction that you are moving in."}
{"text": "As darius, Peel for your allies and keep them alive as long as possible. If you are in advance, try to shoot down the enemy rearline. If you are not strong, use your e to peel for your allies. Stay with your team in the end of the game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to choose you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy rearline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at any time so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "Against skarner, Skarner will seek to flank in team fighting with his E. Ward flanks to facilitate your escape before he comes to load you. Avoid fighting in the jungle, around the lenses or near the baron. You must be spaced so that he cannot land his Ultimate on several champions at once. Invest in armor and magical penetration items. Skarner will build tank items and you will be unable to kill him if you do not buy these items."}
{"text": "Against twitch, Don't clump up or stick close together in team fights versus Twitch as his Spray and Pray c will melt you. Spread out and look for a way to burst him down once he reveals himself.\n\nTwitch will often get incredibly close to your team after popping out of his s. Once he has left it, try to take him down as quickly as you can.\n\nControl Wards are essential in team fights. Place Trinkets and Control Wards around you when sieging an objective to spot Twitch before he is able to jump out on you."}
{"text": "As kalista, Your r will hit like a truck and allow you to quickly take neutral objectives. Take all the objectives from the map and don't do anything which may have the chance of getting you killed.\n\nGet a defensive item when possible. This should help a lot if you manage to mis-step during a major skirmish. Only go in when the enemy has used up all the primary forms of CC.\n\nYou will be a prime target for assassins, so make sure you are wary during fights. Also, use your W carefully to cover your flanks when you get the chance to do so."}
{"text": "Against graves, Vision is your best friend against Graves. If you can see him before he ganks a lane, it will be harder for him to get kills and snowball. Make sure you place wards around his jungle entrances to spot him leaving his jungle.\n\nGrouping against Graves will prevent him from taking down key targets in team fights as he will struggle to get through multiple champions at once. CC is also very good against him as he is quite immobile even with his Ultimate t and e.\n\nIn the later stages of the laning phase and early into the mid-game, he will try and kill isolated targets that are walking through Summoners Rift alone. Stick to walking around the map through warded areas only especially if he\u2019s ahead. "}
{"text": "As rumble, Another point in his Ultimate b will seriously tip team fights in chokingpoints in his favor. All he needs to do is time it well and drop it at the appropriate places. He will now have several items at his disposal. This means that his damage will increase considerably, and it should have an easy time to melt through the enemy health bars. The presence of Rumble during mid-game fights is really fabulous. He should be able to win several fights just by using his Ultimate b correctly."}
{"text": "As annie, In the middle of the game, she is powerful every time her Ultimate R is in place. By wandering on overstretched enemy tracks and gauntling the advanced allied tracks should give her a massive lead. Very high potential to pick due to her passive and Ultimate R. After pushing the wave, she should aim to wander around with her Jungler and help the team. Once she gets her core of objects, she can pretty much explode any squishy enemy who has no form of magic resistance in their kit. Buying a Sweeper and playing with vision will give her a boost in power."}
{"text": "As sion, In team fights, he can easily get shot by various champions. He can also get kited easily, which makes it difficult for him to fight team sometimes. He can find it difficult to gank his allies without his Ultimate R. Pre-6, it will be difficult for him to gank too. Sion does not have the greatest objective control in the early match. If you can't take the goal alone, you will need help from your bot line."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Quite immobile, which can lead to him being camped a lot during the laning phase. Once set back during the early game, he won\u2019t be able to dish out a lot of damage.\n\nOn missing his E, Mordekaiser\u2019s opponents can easily all-in and engage on him. This is because he won\u2019t be able to displace the enemy team, and the carries will be able to freely all-in him.\n\nEarly Grievous Wounds can reduce his W damage by a lot. This will help his enemy even out the duels during the early game."}
{"text": "As zeri, Your all-in level 6 will be stronger than his. Force her to extend for the farm by keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Your goals in this matchup are to really just grab her and focus on agriculture."}

You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. However, you will rely on your Support to do the heavy lifting early on. \n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As taric, His Q can allow him to heal massive amounts of damage later in the game. This when combined with his Passive, can let him heal as much during the early skirmishes.\n\nThe Ultimate R can completely change the course of a fight due to it making everyone invulnerable. This is very effective on hyper carries, or when against a champion who has a timed ultimate (Master Yi for example).\n\nHis W provides his carry with bonus resistances which can be really beneficial in the long run due to carries generally not buying defensive items, especially in lower elos."}
{"text": "As riven, Another point in its Ultimate e will significantly increase its damage. All it needs is its time well and use its multiple target r to CC. It will now have its basic elements which means that it will do a lot of damage. It should have an easy time to melt through the enemy health bars if it manages to catch them out of sight. Riven's presence during mid-game fighting is really fabulous. It should be able to win several battles and zone enemies easily using its Ultimate e."}
{"text": "As ashe, At level 9, Ashe will have her maximum y. It's an important peak of power for Ashe because she can use it to bring down the enemy before her team engages in a team fight. When Ashe reaches level 11, she will put a secondary point in her Ultimate w. Her Ultimate w will have a short cooldown and she will be able to look for choices frequently throughout the middle of the game. Ashe should have finished one or two articles during the middle of the game. This makes her a huge threat in team fights that her performance of damage in conjunction with her poke can be devastating to manage."}
{"text": "As amumu, It will be very tanky as it would arrive towards the end of its construction. If it has not gone full tank, its release of damage will be good enough in the fights of the team of end of match. At level 16, Amumu will put the third and final point in its Ultimate y. Its Ultimate should be on a short cooldown and he should have it a little more frequently. Avoid fighting unless it is up in the late match. The teams will always be closely grouped in the late match. It's good for Aumu as he will be able to CC all his team with his Ultimate there."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton would begin to fall now unless he managed to accumulate a considerable advance early on. It is of the utmost importance that Renekton finish the game as quickly as possible. Renekton will now have several articles. This means that he can reliably the first line for his team and inflict a lot of damage to the enemies. As long as he won't get CC'd, he will be able to win fights easily. Level sixteen is a decent peak for Renekton. That's because he goes max. his Ultimate t and poses a massive threat to the enemy team."}
{"text": "As ezreal, The junglers can camp it at this stage as well as it will no longer have any other form of escape, and its E has a very long cooling period. It takes enough time for its itemization to work. It also depends on the fact that it is very skillful to shoot hard and that it will have to place its Qs on the enemy to be effective. Bouffer its E won=t works too well if the enemy has some form of varied CC that it can use to follow on Ezreal after using its E. This obliges it to play a little more defensively, and it cannot push in the wave either, otherwise it can be crushed by the enemy."}
{"text": "As singed, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "As neeko, Its roaming potential can catch your teammates out of sight, so they can alert them to play more cautiously and be prepared for Neeko's potential games or games. Be careful at level 6, as Neeko's death pressure increases significantly This can make the matchup harder for you and your ADC. Exercise caution and be prepared to play defensively, like being caught in its ultimate can cause significant damage or death. Often avoid detaching from your ADC when Neeko's E (Tangle-Barbs) is available. Its root capacity makes you an easy target if you separate from your ally. Instead, focus on providing sustained healing and the utility of your attached position, keeping your ADC safe and secure."}
{"text": "As pantheon, His E allows him to avoid a lot of damage and can act as a huge factor during all the ins. That's why he can transform fighting in his favor especially when he is weak in health. Can easily poke and execute someone with his Q due to how this ability works. This when combined with track brushes, or river brushes can allow him to suffer a lot of damage without taking in return. Pantheon has great potential of choice with his R and W. In the middle of the match, he can get a lot of choice with his team."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Lissandra is very good at level 6 as her Ultimate R increases her kill pressure. She can also set up her Jungler easily with her Ultimate R. \n\nLissandra reaches her true potential when team fighting as her Ultimate R and W are both AOE. Her Passive can also reak havoc in a team fight. \n\nOnce Lissandra has completed her first item, her wave clear will be very strong. You need to make sure you match her damage and push the wave back to prevent her from roaming."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Trading against Heimerdinger can be extremely tedious, but it can be done. Removing his Turrets Q will be the main focus for poke or trading with him. When you use your skill shots (if they are AOE), try to target them so that they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q. This will allow you to clean them up more easily and increase your death pressure in the way. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, his death pressure and strength increase considerably. Keep this in mind and attention to his abilities empowered."}
{"text": "As shen, Shen is weak before he hits level six as he is melee-ranged, and his all-in is heavily dependent on his E landing on his enemies. Missing it will make him take a lot of damage from his laner.\n\nOnce he gets his Ultimate R, he will have a lot of map presence. He can quickly turn the tide of a fight with a well-timed Ultimate R to save his carry.\n\nThe first item component should allow Shen to increase his survivability and damage in the lane. The lane brushes should be used frequently to catch the enemy off-guard and secure kills.        "}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Keep a constant eye on your mana pool. Cassiopeia has short cooldowns (overall) and it\u2019s easy to spam them.\n\nExtended trades work in Cassiopeia\u2019s favour. Her damage does stack up so try to go for extended trades around your E.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R. It is a good all-in tool and good to setup/deny ganks. Make sure you get close to the enemy to ensure you\u2019re able to land it."}
{"text": "As lillia, Lillia is really fast and mobile thanks to her Passive. This makes her hard to catch out of position.

Ping once you activate your Ultimate R so your team knows you want to go in.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that you\u2019re able to put the whole enemy team to sleep with your Ultimate R. This will increase the chances of your team winning the game. Try to apply your Ultimate R to as many champions as possible."}
{"text": "Against xayah, Forcing team fights while Xayah\u2019s Ultimate R is down will make winning them so much easier. Whenever she uses it, try to force another fight after healing up.\n\nAt times, Xayah will be left in the mid lane with her Support to farm. If you spot her team in the side lanes, force a fight with the numbers advantage and then take the mid lane tower afterwards.\n\nAs Xayah is really good at kiting, you may need to flank her in team fights to make it harder for her to kite and escape a fight."}
{"text": "As kled, Kled is really good early because he can use his Q and E for everything and destroy his enemy in the trades. His W also plays a central role in it. Once Kled touches level 6, he will have access to his Ultimate R, which will allow him to do everything in the corridors in different ways. He can even make a surprise visit to the bot track. The first element will increase Kled's duel potential. This will make him more powerful than he is already, which is terrible news for the enemy."}
{"text": "As hwei, Continue placing vision and warding for your teammates. Avoid warding alone, or else you will die. Your squishy body makes you very vulnerable in the late game.\n\nStay with your team at all times.

Use your E and Ultimate to scout for picks and take down enemies who have over extended without assistance.\n"}
{"text": "As pyke, Level 2 is a good peak for Pyke because it can immediately all-in-the-enemy. This will help him get quick murders if he manages to push and reach Level 2 first. Level 6 is a massive peak of power as he can now execute champions with his Ultimate R. This means that he can quickly kill his laner or any other squishy with a rotation of his spells and his Ultimate R. Boots are a massive peak of power that allows Pyke to travel the map very quickly."}

{"text": "As darius, Darius starts to fall in the end of the game, but it is still powerful. He falls as other champions start to get elements that counter him, and many champions will be more tankier, which makes it harder for him to kill them. At level 16, Dariuss Ultimate e will be an essential tool in team fighting. As he can do a considerable amount of damage and as he is an execution- he will be able to remove targets and use reset to kill several targets. At this stage of the game, Darius should be almost max build. As he builds items that increase his damage and offer protection, he will be relatively tanky and difficult to remove."}

It will also be instrumental when it comes to flanking the enemy team in important battles. His first element will give him a good boost. He is already a bit heinous due to his Q and W. Yet, the component will now make him recall the enemy abruptly enough. Gnar is relatively weaker early because he does not have his final R available. As a result, he cannot extinguish much damage. To compensate for this, he will want to use the track brushes and his range advantage to continue hitting the enemy champion while using his E as a measure to maintain the spacing between his enemy and him."}
{"text": "As zilean, His Q W Q combo can allow him to stun a group of enemies which is highly beneficial in close-quarter combat. His scalings are quite high as well so he can deal a lot of damage through that combo.\n\nHis Ultimate t, when used properly, is one of the most obnoxious and overpowered abilities in the game. That combined with his p can make one of his carries nearly uncatchable and unkillable.\n\nHis p allows him to guarantee a Q W Q hit on a specified target. This can be highly beneficial in setting a death brush before a major objective fight."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Don't regroup closely in an objective fight or team because it gives Gragas the opportunity to hit your entire team with his Ultimate R. In a fight, make sure you're not too forward or get away from your team. If you're too forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught like this could lead the enemy to take a goal soon after. Constantly try poke and harass Gragas. Having him in bad health will prevent him from playing or aggressively positioning himself."}
{"text": "As qiyana, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, Malzahar isn\u2019t very strong in the early game and can be made weaker by destroying his Passive shield whenever it comes up. As soon as he gets it, pop the shield so he has to play even safer.\n\nMalzahar will be looking to push the wave constantly once he has an item. Avoid standing inside the minion wave at all times so he cannot poke you and push at the same time.\n\nOnce Malzahar hits level 6, you\u2019ll have to play more respectful as he will tend to get ganks once his Ultimate R is up. Whenever he has his Ultimate R up, make sure you have wards in the river so you can spot the Jungler before they get to your lane."}
{"text": "As neeko, An Ultimate R maximum-out will allow Neeko to use the ability quite frequently. All she has to do is find a flank on the enemy team. Her team fight at the end of the game is really powerful. She can disrupt a whole team with a well-positioned E or Ultimate R. Her damage at the end of the game is absolutely massive."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Make sure there is always a minion between you and Pyke at all times to make it harder for him to land his Q.\n\nPyke will try to push the wave as much as possible early so he can get a quick back and get his first item. Harass and poke him down so he has to recall before he can get enough gold for Dirk.\n\nPyke is a great roaming champion. Once he gets Mobility Boots, expect him to roam frequently. Ping whenever he leaves lane so your teammates know that he is missing. Try and match his pushing power so you do not lose your Tower if he roams."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus will have a decent amount of batteries and will take part in the team fights now. He should be a threat to all the squishy targets in the enemy team. He will now have several items, which will make it easier for him to go down from the wing and the enemy team. He will increase massively his damage performance as well. At level 11, he will have two points in his ultimate R. This will increase both his tankness and kill the pressure at the same time. His Passive will help him a lot when it comes to diving into the enemy rear line and surviving."}
{"text": "As pyke, The first element will allow him to inflict tons of damage to his opponent, and the trading will eventually become more accessible to him. Regular exchanges allow Pyke to easily win the track. Level six is a massive power peak as he can now execute champions with his Ultimate R. This means that he can quickly kill his laner or any other squishy with a rotation of his spells and his Ultimate R. Pyke is a worthy champion of the beginning of the game. He can blow up enemies, can wander relentlessly, and secure peaks all over the map. He will allow him to capitalize and get out over his enemies."}
{"text": "As poppy, Her Q can easily be ruled out because it has a very short range. Can be easily killed if she overextends with her E. She also acts as a front line so that the enemy can flank her teammates before leaving for her. The misuse of her Ultimate R can land both her and her team in huge problems. It is especially true if the enemy team has a kind of heavy commitment that can get on her team."}
{"text": "As yasuo, The incorrect use of his W can cause him to kill in the way. This is especially true against various matchups. The alternative is to step back, which allows the enemy of just Yasuo area of the wave. Very vulnerable to crowd control because it prevents him from throwing his E for a while. He can't throw E on the same target twice, so he can easily be taken out."}
{"text": "As teemo, Avoid track brushes at any cost in this matchup. Teemo can easily blind you from them and you won't be able to do anything about it. Get a sweater and keep cleaning his traps in this matchup. This will help you significantly when it comes to fighting Teemo. You don't have to fight Teemo in tight space because its traps will make it really hard for you to do anything to him. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy doesn't have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As zyra, Your immobility is your greatest weakness on Zyra. Therefore, you should always be conscious of your positioning in lane and in team fights.\n\nDuring a fight, always stay at a distance and avoid crowd control abilities. Once locked down, you won\u2019t be able to do anything to save yourself and will most probably get killed if the enemy follows up on you.\n\nMissing your E places you in a very vulnerable position, so only try to land it when you can guarantee a hit. "}
{"text": "As jhin, By getting his Ultimate R maximized, he will be able to inflict massive amounts of damage and can completely decimate squishy targets. He will also be able to choose enemies for his team with his Ultimate R. His 4th shot will hit like a truck during this phase of the game. This means that the squishy enemies will never be safe, especially when Jhin is properly peeled by his team. Its release of damage and kiting potential will increase in the late game due to his articles. This also means that it will be pivotal towards obtaining neutral goals."}
{"text": "As lissandra, At level 9, Lissandra's Q will be maxed out. This means that she will be dealing tons of damage now, especially in grouped fights.\n\nLissandra is really good in team fights. She can easily CC high priority targets and single-handedly win a team fight due to her AoE abilities and Passive.\n\nHer Ultimate R at level 11 will provide her with a lot of pick potential. She can use that ability frequently, which means that team fights and picks will be pretty frequent."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, Miss Fortune is not very strong in early play, but she has a lot of poke damage with her t. Watch your positioning and avoid standing behind the minions whenever possible. Post 6, stand in the middle of the track at all times to facilitate the exit of her Ultimate e when she channels it. If you stand by a wall, it will be harder for you to escape the damage."}
{"text": "As malphite, He is weak early on as his presence is negligible, and he can't do much against ranged champions. All he needs to do is conserve his health till he gets to level six.\n\nOnce he hits level six, his presence will skyrocket, becoming a significant threat for the enemy laner. Working with the allied Jungler will help him massively.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities quite frequently. It will also let him deal more damage, especially once he gets his Ultimate h.        "}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Ziggs will try to delay a team fight for as long as possible while he pokes with his Q. Try to force a fight so he is unable to poke you down and force you to disengage.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult for you to siege objectives like Towers when Zigg\u2019s is alive. Try to catch him out of position or flank him when he\u2019s alone to make taking these objectives easier.\n\nKeep track of jungle camp timers and steal away his blue buff as it spawns. This will reduce his effectiveness in team fights and make it harder for him to poke you down before a team fight occurs."}
{"text": "Against teemo, At level 6, Teemo\u2019s pressure increases thanks to his Ultimate t giving him extra damage and the ability to place Mushrooms t all around the map. \n\nThe more ability haste Teemo buys, the more Shrooms t he can place around on the map. Try to take unorthodox pathing to prevent walking through them.\n\nNashor\u2019s Tooth is a core item for Teemo. It gives him lots of additional stats- which makes him more of a threat."}
{"text": "Against briar, As a murderer, she will seek to take down targets walking alone or too far forward and away from their team. Stay together and force the fights when she's not there. Expect her to fly away in the team fights. Place a deep, shallow vision to help spot her before she can make a move. Try to blow her up when she enters with her Ultimate R. She's an easy target if she enters alone, so focus on her fast!"}
{"text": "As ahri, In the late game, you should be near max build. You should be able to easily take down any champion who you might come into contact with. Set up ambushes and look to blow up an unexpecting enemy.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 16, you will have 3 points in your Ultimate. You can look for more aggressive plays and look for picks on overextended targets. It will be on a low cooldown in the late game, so don\u2019t be afraid to go for risky picks as you can use it to escape if you miss your E.\n\nAhri falls off in the late game as the enemy will be healthier, and most champions will buy defensive items to protect them. It is unlikely you will be able to burst down any frontline champions, but you can quite easily take down the enemy Support or ADC."}
{"text": "As pantheon, The half-game should be easy for you, and you will be ganking enemies quite frequently. Just make sure to rely on peaks and kill squishy targets whenever possible. Your presence will be massive during the skirmishes, but you will need to use your E carefully. You can even try Flash > W enemies that are high priority and must be released quickly. You will want to help your support and work with them to make sure that you can capitalize on your advance. This is important to end the game quickly."}
{"text": "Against sett, Avoid regrouping closely as this can allow Sett to get a multi-person E that will help his team win the team fight. Slightly split up will be better for you in the long run. Don't walk too far in setting a goal as Sett can use his Ultimate R to take the closest champion and throw them into their allies behind them. If you are grouped together and online with each other, it will be harder for him to do it. When there is no team fight, Sett will set himself in a side lane and try to divide the thrust. When he is alone, you could look for him or start a team fight with his allies when he is unable to help them."}
{"text": "Against camille, In team fights, try to cast your Ultimate R when the enemy is bunched together so it can bounce between multiple champions and deal more damage.\n \nDelay a team fight for as long as possible while you harass and poke the enemy down with your W.\n \nGet as close to the enemy laner as you can before using your Q. The further away you use it, the harder it will be for you to land it."}
{"text": "As ekko, Play safely for the first levels. While the Ekko game is strong, you need to stay healthy so you can look for an all-in after having more levels under your belt. Ekko has a strong roaming potential and is a strong skirmisher. Get priority in your way and then try to wander and help your allies. Playing around your Ultimate W. It's a strong tool that can help win battles and overcome the enemy. Always keep this ability in mind when you are fighting the enemy."}
{"text": "As poppy, Focus on early agriculture. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP. However, if you find an opportunity to sow or counter-gang nearby, don't be afraid to take it. If they invade you early, just back; you don't win early skirmishes with them. Try to secure these major goals when you can, as you have decent objective control."}
{"text": "As veigar, Stay with your team in the late game. Do not separate or walk away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for a choice with your n to win the number advantage. Then, use your Ultimate R to get them down quickly before looking to seat or take a goal nearby. At this stage of the game, you should have tons of batteries and be really strong."}
{"text": "As katarina, When Katarina hits level sixteen, she will be mighty due to her Ultimate R. This will help her clean up the game easily.\n\nKatarina deals a lot of damage during the late game due to all her items. Her burst damage can one-shot enemies and carriers alike.\n\nSince it is the late game, the enemies will have many defensive items. This means that Katarina will have a hard time killing them. Playing around vision should help a lot with this. "}
{"text": "As anivia, Keep pushing the wave of minions with your Ultimate m while remaining safe. Keep the waves pushed so that the enemy is unable to do anything or sit any of your goals. Rotation and move on to goals like the Dragon or Rift Herald and help your Jungler take them. Anivia can help take these goals incredibly quickly. Make sure you have the vision around your path at all times."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Hecarim is a strong duelist in the early game and will try to solo kill you early on. Do not underestimate his early game damage as he will usually come out ahead.\n \nLook at what Summoner Spells Hecarim has taken. If he\u2019s taken Ignite, he will be looking to play ultra-aggressive early to get kills. If you\u2019re low, do not try and trade with him as he will finish you off with Ignite.\n \nHecarim has good Dragon taking ability and can solo it early on thanks to his AOE heal from his W and short cooldown h. Make sure you have vision on the Dragon at all times. If you can, try to take it away from him."}
{"text": "As ornn, Don't fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available. Peel for your aircraft carriers to keep them alive longer. If your allies die quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooling time in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone isolated and alone, too far ahead, or out of position."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Kayle is really weak in the early game. Try to abuse her as much as possible so she is forced to back early and delay her first major power spike.\n\nOnce Kayle hits level 6, she will become ranged and get a lot of added protection thanks to her Ultimate R. You need to always consider her Ultimate R when trying to fight her post level 6.\n\nAs Kayle becomes stronger as the game goes along, you really need to end the game as quickly as possible. If you cannot end the game and it gets to late game, you are gonna find it difficult to win."}
{"text": "Against rumble, When Rumble's r is down, its damage production will be greatly reduced. Wait for it to use its r on the jungle camp before initiating a skirmish with it. Rumble has good objective control early. Try to secure the goals before he has the opportunity to take them on his own."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Make sure you're still standing behind a minion at any time to make it harder for him to land his Q and push you down. The best time to go for trades and kicks on Ezreal is when his E is on the cooldown. If he's using it aggressively, try to abuse cooldown and look for an aggressive game while he's defenseless. If Ezreal uses his Ultimate R to sniper someone on the map, ping your team while he's moving through Summoners Rift. This will help them avoid incoming ability. Although this ability is on the cooldown, you could look to play aggressive and try to fight it."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Continue to regroup with your team and stay close to your support. If you are still too far ahead, the enemy can seek to withdraw. Stay behind your team. Monitor your positioning at all times in the team fights. Try to stay at the maximum possible distance to increase your chances of reducing damage and surviving the team fight. Try to use your e range and the poke of your y to harass the enemy as often as possible before a team fight occurs. Do this without putting you in a bad position if possible."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Do not try to execute Wukong if he still has his y available. This is because you may waste your execution on him and he will survive. Keep this in mind when trading too!\n\nWukong wins a lot of auto-attack battles, so don\u2019t go for extended trades with him unless you can kill him.\n\nIf Wukong has left lane after level 6, tell your team as soon as he leaves. He might be trying to use his Ultimate n in a different lane too help his allies."}
{"text": "As trundle, Trundle has great gank set up and can easily catch enemies thanks to its e. If they are in a particular bottleneck, it will be difficult for them to escape from it. Its Ultimate n makes it incredibly tanky and difficult to kill. If it is laning against a tank, it will be really difficult to kill. Trundle offers a good peel and a good usefulness for his team. It is a good Support."}
{"text": "As tristana, Her attack range will be pretty high during this phase of the game. It will let her dish out a lot of damage while staying safe from CC.\n\nAnother point in her Ultimate R will allow her to deal more damage and bolster the finishing move. It will be on a low cooldown which means that she can use it quite frequently.\n\nThis stage of the game is make or break for Trist. She can be strong, but if she isn't ahead, she will be icnredibly weak."}
{"text": "As sona, Harass the enemy throughout the laning phase with your Q. Your goal is to constantly harass the enemy whenever possible and get kills.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead. Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the objective to make it easier to secure the mid lane tower.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate R is up, try to use it on the enemy laners to get their health low. Ideally, poke them down first before using it to make it easier for you to kill the enemy. "}
{"text": "As vex, Maximizing the release of the damage can be very difficult on Vex, especially when launching against the champions with dashes. Even with her W, she still fights against some all-in champions. Although she has a good clear wave, she can come out pushed and out by the champions with a higher range and damage."}
{"text": "As masteryi, When there is no team fight, go on a side track and push. You must continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. The more gold the master Yi has, the stronger he will be. If your team gets one or two killed, call for Baron or the Dragon. You should be able to easily take them as Master Yi. Always use the fog of the war to bamboo the enemy and destroy the enemy backline in this way. It should be really easy to do because of how much damage you can pull out."}
{"text": "Against yone, Yone is better at trading once he unlocks his Ultimate R as he offers him tons of pressure to kill. Once Yone gets 100% chance of critical strike, he takes a lot of damage. Remember that his Passive gives him double chance of writing. Yone is very good in team fights if he is able to get a good Ultimate R off. Don't forget to stay away when it's possible."}
{"text": "As kayle, Another point in her Ultimate R will see her be the most powerful she can be in the game. She can now slice through the enemy team with proper positioning.\n\nHer late-game damage is very high, and she will need to be taken out beforehand if the enemy team has any chance of winning the game.\n\nHer 3rd empowerment is essential and will make Kayle very powerful. Her auto-attacks being permanently empowered will do a number on the enemy team."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Vulnerable when his W is down as he has no other escape capacity left in his kit. The same goes for when he is too pushed into the track. His Q can be avoided quite easily if the enemy stands at a certain distance from him. This is his main form of poke damage, so without it it it will be useless. Level a Ultimate R makes very little damage if the enemy is far from the epicenter of the explosion. It cannot be used as an effective finishing movement unless Ziggs has items or two points in that ability."}
{"text": "Against ksante, His first major power peak is at level 4 when he gets 2 points in his **Q**. It will be easier for him to trade at that time. When his **Ultimate** is up, he is stronger and harder to fight. Additional damage can be quite surprising and difficult to manage."}
{"text": "As trundle, Another point in his Ultimate n will bolster his overall power during duels. It will also let him have a massive presence during team fights.\n\nHe should have his core items by now. This means that he will be tanky and will deal a lot of damage to his enemies. This should be amplified with his Ultimate n.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give a significant boost to his skirmishing potential during this phase of the game.        "}
{"text": "As seraphine, Another point in her Ultimate R will reduce the ability's cooldown and increase the damage. It allows her to be a massive threat during clumped fights.\n\nHer pick potential is massive during this phase of the game due to her being able to CC enemies with her E or Ultimate R. It helps quite a lot during Jungle fights as well.\n\nThe team fights are going to be really good for Seraphine. She can heal and shield her allies for quite a lot with her W while dishing out a lot of damage with her abilities.        "}
{"text": "As sona, A fully maxed out Ultimate R will put it on a very short cooldown, and Sona can completely change the outcome of a fight with that ability. The Flash > Ultimate R combo can be pretty devastating.\n\nHer late-game fights are pretty potent as she can heal up her allies for quite a lot of health and deal a lot of damage quickly. Her Ultimate R will be game-changing as well.\n\nShe will have many items during this phase of the game, allowing her to deal a lot of damage in short bursts. She can quickly kill squishy targets who can't get away from her."}
{"text": "As veigar, Level 16 is a massive power spike as Veigar will have his Ultimate R maxed out during the game. It can actually allow him to one-shot enemies if he has enough AP.\n\nVeigar will have multiple items by now. He should be focusing on fighting around chokepoints regularly. This simply means that he can destroy enemies if he manages to catch them off-guard.\n\nHis n cooldown will be really low, meaning that Veigar can get frequent picks on crucial targets and peel for his team simultaneously. This is quite important for someone as immobile as Veigar."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Level sixteen is a massive power spike as it increases the defensive capabilities of his Ultimate r. His ADC will be really safe due to the enormous shield they will get.\n\nTahm Kench's tankiness will be out of the world during this phase of the game. He can peel for days for his team and get picks on the enemy with his Q.\n\nHis Q will be on a really short cooldown. This means that his pick potential and poke will increase a lot. He should try to use the fog of war combined with his W to secure picks on the enemy."}
{"text": "As graves, His first ability will be maxed out at level 9, which will help Graves bolster his overall burst damage when fighting with enemies. He will be able to clear minions very quickly.\n\nDue to his items, he will have a lot of kill pressure during the mid-game. His e and e will also let him catch enemies off-guard, and he can kill them very quickly due to his Passive. This will be applicable majorly to objective and clumped fights.\n\nAt level 11, Graves will have two points in his Ultimate t. It means that the potential of that ability finishing off low health enemies increases drastically, especially if he is going for the lethality build."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Whenever your Ultimate is up, try to gank an ally. Your Ultimate should result in a kill for you or your ally if you\u2019re constantly looking for picks.\n\nMake sure you place wards at your jungle entrances so you can spot them before they jump on you. River wards and wards at your jungle entrances are key to counter Jarvan.\n\nDon\u2019t let the enemy Jungler get all the Dragons. Try to secure them with your team after ganking the bottom lane.\n\nBeware of Jarvan's early game pressure. They\u2019re much stronger than you and will try to make plays to get themselves and their teammates ahead.\n"}
{"text": "As bard, Its roaming potential is unrivalled as it can almost always access another route faster than its counterpart, as well as exit from sticky situations using its E. The ability to maintain both its ADC and itself with its W, while obtaining more mana from the collection of its passive chimes allows it to stay on the track for a long time. Due to its liabilities, it can quickly pass between staying on the track and roaming. A good Ultimate R can help its team launch a fight and set up a combo, especially when Bard manages to follow its Ultimate with its Q. This ability can also be used to block neutral goals and disengage if necessary."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level nine is a massive powerspike for Heimerdinger. He will now have maxed out an ability and will be dishing out a lot of damage depending on his maxed ability. Additionally, as a mid laner, he will now be able to CC and blow enemies up with his abilities.\n\nAdding another point to his Ultimate R will skyrocket his overall power in the lane. This is because the empowerments will be more powerful, and Heimerdinger will use them both offensively and defensively. In addition, it will let him harass the enemy laner relentlessly when they are trying to farm in the lane.\n\nHeimerdinger excels during team fights as he can control a large area with his Q turrets. This will be really useful in clumped areas like the objective pits and the Jungle paths."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks Ultimate R is very good in team fighting, especially in closed areas as it will allow it to inflict damage to tons of champions at once. Moreover, in team fighting, his W will heal him a lot. Additional support/damage will be really beneficial in team fighting."}
{"text": "As alistar, You should always save your Jungler while they are busy invading. During objective fighting, always try to get a multi-man knockup when you can. If such a thing is not possible, focus the enemy Jungler and do everything you can to keep it out of the objective pit. This will allow your Jungler Smit the lens peacefully. While you watch, keep looking at the map and see if you can flank the enemy and dive them under their turn with your Ultimate. Only if your team is able to track, and move the enemy with your e."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a powerful level 2 everything in with its Q and E spam. Make sure to hit level 2 at the same time which is the first wave followed by 1 melee minion on the second wave to reduce its ability to kill you. Cassiopeia has mana problems in the early game. If it is weak on the mana, it could be a good time to fight it because its release of damage will be greatly reduced because it relies heavily on the mana for the trade."}
{"text": "As ryze, Can\u2019t really do much during the early game, especially if he is against something with hard CC or if he is getting camped.\n\nExtremely item reliant and won\u2019t dish out a lot of damage if he was set behind during the early and mid game.\n\nHis Ultimate R changes the positioning of him and anyone inside the circle. This can make Ryze outplay himself and get his entire team killed if proper vision is not set-up before the usage of the ability."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine has low base stats and is pretty vulnerable in the early game. Play safe and avoid taking damage to increase your survivability.\n\nSeraphine lacks an escape tool. This reduces her chances of dodging skill shots and makes it harder for her to escape an all-in from the enemy.\n\nThe shield and heal you get from your W is pretty lackluster, especially in the early game. Do not rely on it to save you or your ADC\u2019s life."}
{"text": "Against drmundo, Dr. Mundo will look at the power farm early so he can get as much gold as possible. Try to gank as often as possible to advance your sleds. Dr. Mundo has a good Dragon control and can easily take it after his first back. With this in mind, make sure that you take the crab side of the scuttle bot or keep the Dragon kept at all times so that you can spot and kill while he does. At level 6, Dr. Mundo will start looking at gank as his Ultimate R offers him a lot of duelling power. You can delay this in invasion and steal his camps."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, Push the first few waves and then remember for your first element. This will give you one on the enemy in the early lacquering phase. Keep a constant eye on the minimap, push the wave and look to impact your sideways with your W. In early play, focus on getting as much star dust as possible to increase the rest of your abilities."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, The more items he gets, the harder he will be to kill. Keep this in mind and try to deny him farm, XP, gold and resources to reduce his effectiveness in the later parts of the game.\n\nAt level 6, Nautilus will be extremely scary. He may get Jungler help in lane to kill you as his Ultimate e is a great gank setup tool.\n\nHe will be good in team fights thanks to his Ultimate e which is point and click CC. He also has tons of CC which will make him really effective in fights."}
{"text": "As ryze, Consider getting an armor pen as Ryze tends to buy armor items. Expanded trades will work for you, prioritize them on the shortest. Care for its range and auto attacks to avoid unnecessary damage."}
{"text": "As zilean, Zilean should stick to his team like glue as his Ultimate t will cause the enemy team's downfall, provided he uses the ability correctly. The lower cooldown will certainly make extended fights a breeze for Zilean's team.\n\nZilean will max out his Ultimate t at level 16. This will allow him to have a minuscule cooldown on his Ultimate t. In contrast, the health with which the Ultimate t'd target respawns will increase. \n\nHe will have all his items by this point of the game. This means that his damage output will be massive, especially when it comes to his Q > W > Q combo. A single Q on a squishy target can easily chunk them out."}
{"text": "As jhin, Use your Q and W as much as you can and make sure you cut the enemy. Make sure to use your pupils and E traps to save you from the ganks. Do not push too far, otherwise you will become a leading gank target. Once you get your Ultimate R, you will be able to flatten a lot of damage and get several dead around the map. See if you can help the sideways."}
{"text": "As skarner, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. He should strengthen his survival and damage in the game, and he should be able to make more choices now. Skarner's team fight is phenomenal during this phase of the game. He can absorb the damage while making sure that he gets crucial choices in the enemy team. At level 11, he would put a second point in his Ultimate. Cooldown will reduce him to make choices more frequently."}
{"text": "As anivia, Look for aggressive parts at level 2 as you are stronger than it at level 2. Look for aggressive parts when its dizziness is down. Fight it after it uses its dizziness that you will win a fight with it. Post 6, it will just keep pushing you in your turn, so you can try to force it to exceed the extension and then pursue it down the track."}
{"text": "As thresh, Thresh is really tanky during this phase of the game as he will have a lot of items. This will allow him to both engage and peel for his carries at the same time.\n\nThresh doesn't spike too hard at level 16 because his Ultimate a effects still remain the same. This basically means that he has begun falling off and is now reliant on his Q to win the game.\n\nThresh exists to peel for his carries and find targets with his Q at this stage of the game. If he happens to miss the ability, he won't be able to do anything till it is back up again (unless he has his Flash)."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar has great selection potential with his Ultimate R Picking a champion could win you the game! Malzahar has a shield that will protect him from incoming damage. This increases your survival in the lane. He can win a team fight alone if he can choose a key target with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against varus, Varus has good pick potential with his Ultimate R. Avoid overextending or being in range of him when sieging in the mid lane as he could look to start the fight.\n\nPicking off Varus before a team fight is highly effective. Bursting him is one of the best ways to do so as he is rather squishy and immobile due to the lack of a dash or escape ability.\n\nVarus will try to delay a team fight for as long as possible while he harasses with his Q and E."}
{"text": "As sion, Make sure you are present during the team fights. This will allow you to peel for your portages and prevent them from dying from the start of the fight. Your Ultimate R will allow you to disrupt the fights and kill the portages with ease. Doing so in bottlenecks will easily win you the game. Always try to do everything and choose the enemy Jungler every chance you get. Doing so will allow you to take neutral goals easily."}
{"text": "Against fiora, Fiora is a large divided pusher and one of the best duelists in the game thanks to her Ultimate R and Q. If you can't pair her in a side track, try your best to force an uneven team fight on the other side of the map. Fiora relies heavily on the theft of life. Buy a serious injury item early to neute a large part of what makes her such a good duelist. Keep a constant eye on Fiora's map and location when you're bundled with your team. If it disappears, expect her to join the team fight. If she stays in a side track, don't let her destroy your base while you're trying to fight."}
{"text": "As swain, Investing in the reduction of healing. It will reduce its durability. Stay as far as possible so that it cannot land or use its Q on you. Look for your abilities so they push you and push you at the same time. At level 6, it can be difficult to kill Swain. Look only for all-in if your Jungler is nearby and ready to help."}
{"text": "As rell, At level 16, Rell will have maxed out her Ultimate R. This allows her to use the ability more frequently, making it harder for the enemy team to roam near unwarded areas.\n\nShe is exceptionally tanky during the late game, and her play-making potential is immense. All she needs to do is make sure that she doesn't go in without any follow-up damage.\n\nHer pick potential skyrockets during this phase of the game, especially during fights near choke points. Her Ultimate R's short cooldown will help her secure multiple picks frequently."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, In team fights, don't stay too far ahead in case he tries to make a game. Watch your flanks! Pantheon can try to attack you on the side and go to your carts when his Ultimate R is on cooldown. Good time to fight is when Pantheon is divided push. Force a fight when he is on the opposite side of the map could be a good idea because it will take him time to get into the fight even with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, It is especially true if someone manages to interrupt their Ultimate R, because it is the ability that can turn the tide of a team fight alone. The seriously painful wounds are quite effective against him. He is equally squishy as well as he was not able to do much if the enemy team gets a reduction of healing during the early match. His greatest weakness is an enemy team that can keep well. This is legitimately going against the Fiddles entirely and preventing him from all-inning the enemy team in a coherent way. The vision will allow the enemy to anticipate his movement and react accordingly."}
{"text": "As morgana, His Q can be blocked by minions. If the enemy is positioned well throughout the laning phase, it will be very difficult for you to land this ability. Misuse of his E can lead her to many unpleasant situations that are potentially fatal to her. This is especially true if her opponent has a hard form of CC."}
{"text": "As ekko, As Ekko is a melee champion, he will get bullied down by the superior range from other Mid laners. He must not let them bully him down otherwise he\u2019ll fall behind in gold and XP.\n\nCommon flanking spots can easily be warded by the enemy team, reducing Ekko\u2019s flanking potential. Ekko will have to devote some time to clearing wards if he wants to be successful in picking off enemy champions.\n\nEkko is prone to CC. If he gets hit by layered CC, it's going to be difficult for him to deal damage, use his W or escape the fight with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against syndra, Syndra is strong once she has her first element because she will be easily able to push the minion wave with ease and force you under Tower. Syndra is the main power peak early at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Once Syndra has finished Luden. Echo he will add a lot of extra burst to her champions kit."}
{"text": "As gragas, His Ultimate R can easily be dodged by enemies who have dashes or any movement tools.\n\nIf the enemy has good positioning in lane, it will be very difficult for you to engage or use your E in the lane. This is because your E can be blocked by minions if the target is not directly behind them.\n\nGragas\u2019s Ultimate R is very easy to mess up. You may want to use it aggressively to knock someone forward but instead, knock them backwards."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille has a good potential out of the game with her E and Ultimate R. She can often surpass the enemy and turn around or escape the exchanges with ease. She is a difficult champion that is quite fun and rewarding. Players who put a lot of effort to learn her will reap the rewards of a veteran player Camille. Her Ultimate R is a good tool that can lead a murder every time. If she is unable to kill the enemy lantern, she can go another way and use it instead."}
{"text": "Against fizz, When playing as a melee champion, do not go for extended trades with Fizz as he will always come out ahead thanks to his W.\n\nUnless you benefit from any other wave manipulation, try and keep the wave even or closer to your side. This prevents him from engaging on you or chasing you down.\n\nFizz has insane roaming potential. Do not blindly follow him as he can easily turn around and kill you. Instead, communicate with your team while following him from a distance if possible."}
{"text": "As zyra, Get level 2 first and look for a favourable trade. Gaining an early health lead is key to getting a kill later on down the line. Level 2 in the bottom lane is the first minion wave followed by the next 3 melee minions.\n\nYour goal during the laning phase is so to look for kills and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to gain a lead.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As karma, Stay with your team in the late game. Getting caught out will result in the enemy forcing a fight or taking the Baron. Avoid straying too far away from them.\n\nProtect your allies as much as possible in team fights. Keeping them alive for as long as possible while dealing damage will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nIn team fights, use your empowered d to provide a large shield to your allies. Unless you need to use your Q or d, you should try to use your d to help them survive."}

Recall if you\u2019re low.\n\nFocus on poking and limit fighting early on. Wait until you have some items so you can match their auto-attack damage.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your side of the map early on. It will help keep you safe, and they\u2019re immobile and you can capitalize on this with your Jungler.\n"}
{"text": "As shaco, You are really good at securing objectives in the early game. Look to secure objectives whenever they\u2019re up.\n\nFind a healthy balance between ganking your allies, farming your jungle and securing objectives.

Your champion is very good at repeatedly ganking lanes over and over again."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Post-six, he can start avoiding ganks and can roam around and try to get kills. Once he gets the snowball rolling, it is very hard to stop him, especially if he hits level eleven.\n\nExcellent burst damage potential on a mispositioned enemy. This becomes extremely strong from level eleven, and can practically one-shot targets.\n\nDue to his Ultimate k and his item spikes, if he manages to get some kills early on with the help of his Jungler and Support, he will completely take over the game effortlessly."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, Another point in his Ultimate will allow him to use the ability frequently, and he should be able to divide the thrust, and secure picks quite often. At level 9, he will have maximized his first ability. This will allow him to erase his wave quickly and allow him to wander and attend objective fights. His selection potential is really high during the middle of the game. That's because his Ultimate combined with his Gold card will make for some really big coins."}
{"text": "As yone, Flank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nAfter your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "As warwick, At level 11, Warwick will put an additional point in his Ultimate R. The cooldown will be reduced and he will be able to get picks on enemies moving around the map or trying to fight him alone.\n\nAt level 9, Warwick will max out his first ability, which is usually his Q. The extra sustain and damage it gives this ability will make him a huge threat to the enemy.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Warwick can be a strong split pusher: using his insane 1v1 potential and movement speed to escape scary situations while he is overextended. \n"}
{"text": "As karma, Karma early game poke is really obnoxious, especially for laners who are melee in nature. She can use her Q to both poke and wave clear simultaneously, which allows her to get lane priority, and her Jungler can safely invade the enemy as a result.\n\nThe first component offers a lot of poke from Karma's end as it increases the damage of her Q and allows her to use it frequently as she will have more mana to use.\n\nLevel 6 isn't a huge spike, but it definitely increases the amount of poke damage she can deal with her abilities. Her empowered Q is a force to reckon with once she hits level 6. Using the lane brushes will offer an additional layer of safety to Karma while ensuring that the enemy laner has a horrible time in the lane."}
{"text": "As darius, At level 9, Darius would have maximized his e. His all-in potential and the pressure to kill is still very good during the middle of the game. At level 11, Darius will put a secondary point in his Ultimate e. If he got a slight lead in the game early, he will be difficult to manage in the middle of the game, and he should be able to kill any enemy who tries to prevent him from sharing the push. During the middle of the game, Darius should have completed some articles. He should be able to do a lot of damage to the targets, and also be a bit tanky. The articles he picks up make him a huge problem during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As jinx, She will execute multiple targets with her Ultimate R once it is completely maxed out. This will help her maintain her distance and proc her Passive.\n\nAt level 13, Jinx will have 2 of her abilities maxed out. This will increase her overall damage and self-peel potential in the game.\n\nJinx is huge during late-game fights if she has her items. Her Passive will let her kite once proc'd, and she will be able to use her range advantage to melt enemy teams."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Keep an eye on your position as champions as well as his. If you keep your eye out of the ball for 1 second, Cho-Gath can end up hitting you with his e or m. Cho-Gath has a lot of support thanks to his passive that restores health. Watch to trade frequently or he will suffer all the damage you inflict on him. Cho-Gath will get a lot of support through his liabilities and the items he buys. Try to match his support starting with Corrupting Potion and buy items like Morello or Executioner."}
{"text": "As pyke, Pyke is a highly mobile champion thanks to his W and E. This allows him to escape sticky situations pretty easily.\n\nPyke\u2019s Ultimate R is an execute which can be a valuable asset in team fights as you can kill the enemy when they\u2019re somewhat healthy.\n\nEven when behind, Pyke can still be very useful in team fights as long as he can execute an enemy."}
{"text": "Against kled, Kled can use his Ultimate R from afar to collapse on the enemies who are overstretched at the beginning of the team fight. When he's in a group, make sure you're all together and no one's too far ahead. When no team fight happens, Kled will try to divide the thrust. When he's not with his team, you could force a team to fight with the numerical advantage, but be aware that he can use his Ultimate R to join the fight quickly."}
{"text": "As gragas, Beware of Gragas's early game invading potential. They can invade you often, so you must be ready. Pay attention to what's happening on the map at all times.\n\nWard for your allies! Gragas is a great ganker, and you can decrease their early power by warding for your allies, so they do not die to ganks.\n\nYour Ultimate is strong, so you must abuse it to gain a lead over Gragas. They will be ganking often, so you need to do so too.\n\nA good Gragas will use their Ultimate whenever it is up to gank an ally. Make sure you gank as much as possible, too so you can apply just as much pressure as them."}
{"text": "Against syndra, Syndra is strong once she has her first item as she will easily be able to push the minion wave with ease and force you under Tower.\n\nSyndra\u2019s main power spike early is at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R.\n\nOnce Syndra has completed Luden\u2019s Echo it will add lots of additional burst to her champions kit."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Lissandra will be using her Q and E to push the wave. Stand outside of the minion wave so she is forced to choose between pushing with her Q or trying to poke you instead.\n\nWhen Lissandra is level 6, you\u2019ll need to play a bit safer as she has increased kill pressure and can set up her Jungler very easily. Make sure you have enough vision around your lane to spot the enemy Jungler before they show up and gank you.\n\nWhen playing as a melee champion, try and stay at max range at all times so it\u2019s harder for Lissandra to CC you with her W. Be careful when walking forward to last hit, and play respectfully if she is zoning you so you don\u2019t take tons of damage."}
{"text": "As viktor, All its capabilities will be upgraded during this phase of the game, which will make it sub-powerful. Its capabilities will hit like a truck from now on. Several articles will also allow it to inflict more damage to enemies, especially those who cling together during the team fights. A maximum of Ultimate m will massively hurt the enemy team. Any type of fight around the bottlenecks will automatically make Viktor the winner."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a powerful level 2 all in with her Q and E spam. Make sure you hit level 2 at the same time which is the first wave followed by 1 melee minion on the second wave to reduce her ability to kill you.\n\nCassiopeia has mana issues in the early game. If she is low on mana, it could be a good time to fight her as her damage output will be heavily reduced as she relies heavily on mana to trade.\n\nShe is an immobile Mage with no escapes. Let her push the wave and then call for assistance from your Jungler to shut her down."}
{"text": "As ornn, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone isolated and alone, too far forward, or way out of position."}
{"text": "As khazix, Prone to CC abilities, especially when his E or Ultimate R is down. Once CC\u2019d, his squishiness allows him to be an easy target to takedown.\n\nImproper usage of his E can get him killed on multiple occasions. The usage of the ability needs discretion, as mistiming it can prevent him from getting his resets which can inadvertently get him killed.\n\nKha\u2019Zix will need sufficient vision around isolated champions as the enemy can sometimes try to bait him in, and collapse on him as soon as he shows up. He will also need to clear vision, else he won\u2019t be very effective in getting kills."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble is very immobile and subject to all in. Try to freeze the wave closer to your side of the map. This will force it to extend for the farm, which can allow you to all of it, deny it from the farm or even set up your Jungler for an easy take. Rumble is rather squishy early and suffers strongly when its r is on the cooldown because it will lack damage."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Focus on farming early. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.\n\nHowever, if you do find a ganking or counter-ganking opportunity nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to take it.\n\nIf they invade you early, just back off; you do not win early skirmishes with them.\n\nLook to gank whenever your Ultimate is up, and try to clean up kills whenever possible."}
{"text": "As ryze, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or walk away from them otherwise the enemy can try to withdraw you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Delaying the team fights while you take the damage with your base combos. Make sure to stay safe in the team fights by looking at your position and avoiding too much superextend. Ryze in the late game inflicts a lot of brilliant damage. Hide in the high traffic areas if you are ahead and look to blow someone up."}
{"text": "Against sona, Once Sona hits level 6, her kill pressure increases and she can start to play more aggressive. Additionally, her Ultimate R offers her extra gank setup, so expect her Jungler to gank post 6. \n\nSona\u2019s healing from her W will be a problem as the game goes along. Make sure your team invests in Executioner\u2019s Calling to reduce her healing ability.\n\nThe more gold Sona gets-, the more of a problem she will be. Try to set her behind to delay her crucial item spikes."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Whenever Veigar uses his n, try to abuse the cool down as it\u2019s his only defensive tool in the early game and once it\u2019s down- he is rather vulnerable. \n\nIn order to get ganks or kill the Veigar, you need to bait out his n first. You can do this by constantly toggling in and out of range of him. Make sure you always bait it out before committing to the all-in.\n\nVeigar has really good gank setup so make sure that you always have the bottom lane warded. Additionally, whenever your Flash is down, you should always play safer so he doesn\u2019t catch you out while you\u2019re forward."}
{"text": "As lillia, Before invading, make sure that you have your passive stacked so that you can win the trade. If they invade you, be ready to fight, but only do so if your passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just step back. Post 6, they win the 1v1 as they are stronger when their Ultimate is in place."}
{"text": "As skarner, It can remove or move teams with its Ultimate. Shooting a cart or isolating someone could easily train your team to get a choice and a murder. As the game develops, it will do a lot of damage and also be very tanky. It can absorb a lot of damage for its team while being a major threat at the same time. Can help its allies, divide the thrust and be a real pain for the enemy. Its E can be really hard to play against especially in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As malphite, He is weak early on as his presence is negligible, and he can't do much against ranged champions. All he needs to do is conserve his health till he gets to level six.\n\nOnce he hits level six, his presence will skyrocket, becoming a significant threat for the enemy laner. Working with the allied Jungler will help him massively.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities quite frequently. It will also let him deal more damage, especially once he gets his Ultimate.        "}
{"text": "As kennen, Once Kennen has several objects, he will be able to turn the tide of the game on his own. His poke damage will be enough for two shots of squishy door. When his Ultimate m will be maximized, he will crush a truck loaded with damage. Now Kennen will simply have to rely on the sides and fog of the war to set up a good fight. Late game team fights are often decided in neutral objective pits while taking a goal. Kennen Ultimate m will come very practical during this stage and will allow him to win the match of his team."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 11 isn't great because she can only roam around and make plays. It will reduce the cooldown but do nothing else when it comes to dealing damage.\n\nShe starts coming online during the mid-game.

She can deal much damage now, especially when fighting near the objective pits or choke points."}
{"text": "As sylas, You are much stronger than Sylas early. Invade him and try to fight him in the 1v1.

If you see Sylas gaunting nearby, don't be afraid to counter the gank."}
{"text": "Against shaco, At level 1, expect Shaco to have placed multiple boxes x around the lane. Wait for the minion wave to approach before walking to lane. Do not hug the side of the lane at level 1 as it is likely he has placed boxes there.\n\nIf Shaco has been picked first, avoid playing somebody who needs to hard engage as it will be very difficult for you to engage without dying. Pick someone who is ranged and can poke instead.\n\nWhen playing as a ranged champion, try and use your range advantage to poke and harass him as much as possible. "}
{"text": "Against aphelios, Aphelios is not very mobile so if he runs in a certain direction, he could run towards his Jungler and you could run in danger. Stay out of the minion wave when Infernum r is active because it provides him with a lot of AOE damage and clear wave. Make him choose between pushing the wave and poaching you. When marked by Aphelios r, don't bother to retreat too far as his long-range auto from his second weapon will hit you again. Stay close to him so you can go back."}
{"text": "As kalista, Her laning power will depend a lot on who her Support is. If she has a Support who can compliment her skirmishing power, she will easily take over the lane from level one itself.\n\nKalista's Passive makes it so that she can easily dodge CC abilities especially if they happen to be a skill shot. It also allows her to jump in and out of unwarded brushes to drop vision on enemies.\n\nOnce she gets her Ultimate x, her chase down potential becomes unparalleled. This is especially true if her Support is one of those hard all-in champions."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus will seek to divide the thrust throughout the middle of the game. It is good to divide the thrust thanks to his Q. When Nasus is divided push, you can use the number advantage to start a team fight. During the fight, check the map and keep an eye on Nasus. Be ready to disengage if he is about to take a turn. If Nasus gathers for team fights, try to lock him up with CC so that he is unable to get on your portages and kill them with his Q and R."}
{"text": "As karma, Unlike most champions, Karma unlocks her Ultimate a at level 1. This means that at level 6, she doesn\u2019t have as much pressure in comparison to a lot of other champions especially if they\u2019re level 6 power spike is very strong.\n\nWhenever Karma\u2019s d is down, she is vulnerable to attack and will need to play safely while it\u2019s on cooldown. \n\nHer Q can easily be avoided if the enemy builds up a huge wave or positions correctly. Even the splash damage won\u2019t be enough to get past a huge minion wave."}
{"text": "Against gnar, As soon as Gnar hits level 6, try to avoid standing near walls when he is in Mega Form as he can throw you against them with his Ultimate R and set up his Jungler.\n\nGnar is really good in extended trades if he can use his range advantage as his W can proc in a skirmish. Try to trade around his Q so he cannot easily proc his W.\n\nGnar is much stronger once he has his first item, which is usually Black Cleaver. This item will make him much better in a 1v1, and you\u2019ll have to be slightly more cautious if you\u2019re a tank as Black Cleaver offers armor shred and more mobility."}
{"text": "As quinn, Use your abilities to disrupt Quinn's mobility and limit his ability to reposition himself in combat. Building a armor will help you reduce the amount of damage Quinn can do to you with his physical damage, increasing your chances of surviving and fighting. Consider using your ultimate to interrupt Quinn ultimate. Then you can put his head in your CC. As far as possible, try to engage on Quinn when his E is on cooldown. This will reduce his ability to escape and increase your chances of getting her down."}
{"text": "As sett, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side.

Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game.

{"text": "As yorick, Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs. As you are not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}

With the constant usage of this ability, Sona can force her laners to recall abruptly and cause a setback in their plans.\n\nShe scales like a truck and becomes extremely strong during the late game. It allows her to deal respectable amounts of damage while also healing and shielding her team for a good amount.\n\nHer Ultimate R can completely turn the tides of a lost team fight. It will let her team look for an all-in as well, or win a skirmish over an objective."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Level 3 is a massive peak because it has all its capabilities at its disposal during this game phase. It can use them quite efficiently if it uses the track brushes. Level 6 is a decent powerspoke because Seraphine will get its Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is piled together or standing in a line. It also helps during neutral and objective fighting. The first element increases its damage and allows it to use its capabilities a little more frequently."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Start focusing on the enemy backline from now on. It should be effortless for you to do so as long as you're in the fog of war and have a defensive item like a Zhonya's Hourglass.\n\nYour Ultimate R} will have a very short cooldown. This simply means that you can frequently fight around the map. Ensure that you are taking part in neutral, objective fights as well.\n\nPicking off wandering enemies should be a pretty viable strategy during this phase of the game. If you manage to find a high-priority enemy target, don't hesitate to Flash > Q the target to kill them."}
{"text": "As renata, At level 9, Renata Glasc maximizes her first ability. It will be really good for her as she will inflict damage and be able to keep her allies alive for much longer. 2 points in her Ultimate R at level 11 offers her additional selection potential at this stage of the game. As the teams begin to regroup in the middle of the game, she will be strong enough. Putting an extra point in her Ultimate R is great for Renata as the teams start to regroup in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As kassadin, His early play is very weak and he can be killed countless amounts of time during this phase. If he is not able to get his peaks of the article early, he will take enough time to come online. Can easily camp throughout the laning phase. This can hinder him from CS. This can put him back massively in place. Extremely weak against all-in champions, especially those who have dashes or blinks. He is also vulnerable every time he doesn't have Flash early, so good wave management can really be devastating for him."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, In team fights, try to lock Kog\u2019Maw down as quickly as you can. This will reduce his ability to deal lots of damage with his e and auto-attacks.\n\nAt times, Kog\u2019Maw will be left alone with his Support in the mid lane. You can abuse this by ambushing the two of them when the enemy is split up around the map. From there, you can take objectives in the mid lane.\n\nPositioning is key for Kog\u2019Maw. If he mispositions or walks too far forward to harass, make sure you capitalize on it and take him down."}
{"text": "As nasus, Incredibly weak early game. This means he needs to play safe and avoid trading until he\u2019s got quite a few levels under his belt.\n\nHas a lot of poor matchups. In the current meta, he will struggle to lane against a lot of enemy champions.\n\nRelies heavily on the late game to win. As games end around or before the 30-minute mark, his late-game carry potential is lessened."}
{"text": "As jinx, It is important that you stick with your team in the late game. Do not move around the map or go anywhere unless someone is with you.\n\nStand towards the back end of your team near your Support. Avoid walking too far away from anyone in the late game. Getting caught out will result in the enemy being able to push their advantage and finish the game.\n\nWatch your positioning in the late game. Focus on kiting and auto-attacking the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so you do not get caught out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "As swain, Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take control of the fights very easily. Its damage output will be quite phenomenal as well. His presence in the middle of the game and his combat style is really great. He can delimit the enemies and separate the enemy front line from the rear line. He can also choose targets out. The first ability will be maximized at level 9, adding a lot of brilliant damage to his kit."}
{"text": "Against graves, Graves auto attacks are not always effective as monsters/minions/towers block his damage and consume a bullet. Stay behind a monster or minion to avoid his auto-attack damage. When fighting around the Scuttle Crab, make sure it\u2019s in between you and him so it blocks an auto. \n\nWhen duelling Graves, try and stand away from terrain as he will use it to his advantage to make his l explode quicker.\n\nGraves is a very strong duelist. Don\u2019t fight him unless he\u2019s low on health and low on ammo. He is also very good at kiting as well."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in its Ultimate R. As long as it can get the channel out, it will be very good in the late part. The teams will continue to group in the late part. This will allow the Fiddlesticks to get a good amount of damage to the entire enemy team. While you are good in the late part, you are incredibly squishy. Lookout and be careful trying to get a good Ultimate Roff so that you don't get killed before a fight breaks out."}
{"text": "As fizz, At level 16, Fizz will put the third point of his ultimate R if he can land on a squishy target that doesn't have a Guardian Angel or Hurglass, he can quickly remove them. Unless he focuses on defenseless targets, it will be difficult for Fizz to assassinate targets like intelligent enemies will start building defensive objects to protect them from his damage. They will also start grouping what makes it harder for him to take someone."}
{"text": "As xayah, Late game monster if her team peels for her. She will want to farm early on and try to get some kills early on which will allow her to snowball easily.\n\nHer W does deceptively high damage early on, especially when paired with Rakan. This ability when combined with her Q, E, and a heavy CC Support, can allow her to get a huge lead in the lane.\n\nHer Ultimate R can allow her to escape situations in which other ADCs may not survive. This also gives her the agency to root the entire enemy team with a cheeky usage of her Flash and E.\n"}
{"text": "As volibear, The third point of his Ultimate R will make Volibear almost unqualified in the important fights. It will also allow him to get easy team battle victories in the bottlenecks. Volibear will be really tanky during this phase of the game. It can serve both as an engager and a peeler for his team, depending on what his team needs most at this stage. Volibear's selection potential is really high during the middle and end of the game. This is due to the shortest cooling period of his Ultimate R. He should always try to kill enemies who have been taken out of custody."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan has the advantage of the range and will try to intimidate you with its superior range. In early play, only go forward to trade or secure minions so that it can't intimidate you for free. Focus on keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early. This will prevent him from zoned away from the farm, and also allow you to all-in him when he climbs to the minion wave. Your level 6 power peak is much higher than his. Keep this in mind and try to play aggressive and close it when you are level 6. A good time to trade or fight Akshan is when he uses his jump aggressively. You can then jump on him, CC him and then try to fight him."}
{"text": "As rell, At level 16, Rell will have maximized his Ultimate R. This allows him to use the ability more frequently, making it more difficult for the enemy team to travel near unrewarded areas. She is exceptionally tanky at the end of the game, and her game potential is immense. All she has to do is make sure that she doesn't enter without any follow-up damage."}
{"text": "As hecarim, In particular, if you are behind, use your Ultimate t aggressively and then back off and help your team. Continue looking for choices in the end of the game and then use the number advantage to call Baron or force a fight while it is 5v4. Play around your Ultimate t. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate t is up in the late game team fights."}
{"text": "Against olaf, Olaf is incredibly strong in the early game: especially at level 1. Avoid fighting him at all costs as he will beat you if he\u2019s able to land multiple t\u2019s.\n\nIf Olaf throws his t and it\u2019s close to you, try your best to zone him away from the thrown Axes t so he is unable to pick them up.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to reduce his ability to all-in you and chase you down."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Gangplank's level 6 is a massive powerspike for his team and him due to the teamplay potential it carries. He can use it on any lane and help his teammates get multiple kills with ease.\n\nHis first core item will give him a massive boost in his damage and survivability in the lane. He can now duel enemies quickly, and his r should let him deal a lot of damage to squishier targets.\n\nGangplank has a weak early game as he is dependent on items to be dealing a lot of damage. To compensate for this, he should be relying on his r poke and using his barrels to hit both enemy champions and minions together."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Ziggs is pretty good in the middle of the game and team fights if he is allowed to delay a team and poke fight with his Q. You can prevent this peak of power by not allowing him to shoot you down and delay a team fight. His early game is rather weak but he has a constant poke. Try to abuse him in the beginning of the game by trying to play aggressive. Once Ziggs has finished his first element, his poke and clear wave is very strong. Avoid forcing him to remind you otherwise he can easily take your Tour with his Passive and self-auto-auto-auto-auto-auto-auto-attack."}
{"text": "As volibear, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make it easier to access the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks Ultimate R is very good in team fights, especially in closed areas as it will allow him to deal damage to tons of champions at once.\n\nFurthermore, in team fights, his W will heal him a lot. The extra sustain/damage will be really beneficial in team fights.\n\nFiddlesticks laning phase is pretty simple. He is also pretty safe in lane. Focus on poking, trading, and not falling behind."}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu\u2019s early game is weak. He needs time to come online. Focus on farming and avoid over forcing fights. You need to wait until your first major power spike to be genuinely effective.\n\nAmumu\u2019s first power spike is when he unlocks his Ultimate y. Hitting level 6 is crucial, and you need to hit it as early as possible to help your allies.\n\nOnce Amumu has completed his first item, he will be much more robust and more of a menace on Summoners Rift. Make sure you find a healthy balance between ganking and farming to not delay your first item."}
{"text": "As warwick, Warwick can gank pretty well early on, especially if he manages to hit level three and gets access to all his abilities. Once that is done, he should be able to shut down overextended enemies with ease.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike as it allows him to pick targets off. The range on that ability is enormous, making it quite effective from the fog of war.\n\nWarwick's objective control is really high. This is mainly due to his Q healing, which allows him to take neutral objectives really fast.        "}
{"text": "As skarner, Focus on farming and fighting the enemy during the laning phase. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to make it easier.\n\nLook for plays when your Ultimate is up: keep the wave near your tower to make it easier to kill the enemy.\n\nBe prepared to roam around the map and help your mid laner with your Ultimate.\n"}
{"text": "As zac, Look for regular all-ins with your W and E in this matchup. It will allow you to cut still mages really easily and you can win the way early on. When you take fights, make sure you use the war fog to catch the out-of-guard enemy. If the enemy has a dash, make sure you bait the first. As long as your Passive is in place, you should be able to make risky games in this matchup. Make sure that you don't do anything that puts you in a compromising position in the way."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong\u2019s level 3 is quite strong. Once he has all his basic abilities, he can look for a favourable trade. \n\nOnce Wukong hit\u2019s level 6, his kill pressure increases dramatically. Expect him to look for kills once his Ultimate n is up.\n\nWukong is strong in mid-game team fights thanks to the AOE knockup on his Ultimate n. Expect him to look for fights by attacking from the side. "}
{"text": "As lux, Really good potential for bursting with all its g, l, Ultimate n combo. This can remove an enemy squishy with ease from level six itself. Its shield e is misleadingly strong as it can allow it to save all members of its team from a lot of poke. This is also applicable when it is Support. Its g can be used to secure peaks inside the enemy Jungle or blind areas. This can be extremely beneficial if the chosen target is found to be the enemy Jungler or the varied port."}
{"text": "As anivia, Anivia does not have a peak at levels 2 or 3 like most champions. That's because it's not the strongest Mid laner in early play and needs a lot of time to come online. Anivia is the first major power peak when it reaches level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate m. It can constantly push the enemy in their turn, which can prevent the enemy from roaming and helping their allies."}
{"text": "As zeri, Just play safely and focus on using your loaded and Q-attacks to push the enemy out. Talk around the track for more caution. Use your E with extreme discretion in this matchup. It can save you from the ganks if you manage to tighten the terrain while pushing. Be careful though it can give a lot of incentive to mid-laners with hot skills. By getting your R Ultimate, you should be able to dictate the pace of crucial neutral battles. Just make sure you don't go too deep."}
{"text": "As kayn, Kayn will cling once again when he has two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. This increases the output of the overall damage and will allow Kayn to run around the card, pick dead people here and there. His Q will be maximized at level 9. It's really useful for him because it's his primary damage ability. This will allow him to flatten a lot of damage and kill squishies and tanks (depending on his form). This is the stage of the game where Kayn gets his form. According to the comp team, this only choice will be a decisive factor to win the game."}
{"text": "As trundle, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Stay with your team at the end of the game. Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "As chogath, Once Cho-Gath put several points in his s, he will be able to trade more effectively with the enemy. Combined with some of his other power peaks, we will discuss, he can start to exceed the trade of many enemy champions. Cho-Gath can't trade too well until after his first back. When he takes his first component element, the trade becomes much easier for him as his damage and survival increases. At level 6, Cho-Gath kills the pressure increases as he can execute an enemy champion if they exceed. Even if he can't kill them, he can still put his Ultimate t to good use."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, Kog. Maw is rather squishy in early play. Try to abuse his weakness and look for fights to put him behind. Post-6, Kog. Maw will inflict a lot of damage in a job thanks to his e and his Ultimate y. Try to lure his e before committing to the set. Forcing Kog. Maw to extend for the farm is a good way to win the matchup. As it will be overheard, this will allow your Jungler to gank your way. This will also force him to use his Ultimate y or e on the farm with- that you can capitalize on."}
{"text": "As ekko, During the mid-game, Ekko will have completed multiple items. He should be a lot stronger at this stage of the game.\n\nCombined with more items, at level 11 Ekko will put an additional point in his Ultimate R. He will be able to look for more aggressive and risky plays.\n\nAt level 9, Ekko will max his Q. It will help him farm and trade with the enemy."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 9, Ezreal will max out his Q. He will be quite strong at this stage of the game thanks to the additional damage his Q will do and the items he would\u2019ve picked up by then.\n\nPutting the second point in Ezreal\u2019s Ultimate R at level 11 will offer him a lot of extra damage. He will also be able to threaten steals on major objectives like the Baron or Dragons.\n\nEzreal is really good at poking the enemies down before a fight thanks to his low cooldowns and overall damage. During the mid-game, he will be able to harass and poke the enemy a lot."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes lots of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You need to play her a lot to make use of her kit.\n\nWhile Camille is incredibly mobile thanks to her E, whenever it\u2019s on cooldown, she is very vulnerable and easy to take down. Before going in, make sure you check your surroundings as you have no escape when your E is down.\n\nAs she is mechanically difficult, it\u2019s really easy to go wrong on her. If you make a mistake, the enemy can easily capitalise on it and gain a lead. Once Camille is behind, it will be difficult for her to get back into the game."}
{"text": "As ornn, You will want to stick around with your ADC and team as much as you can. Also, neutral objective fights are going to be your bread and butter.\n\nWard up properly and work with your Jungler to secure picks as much as possible. Warding will allow you to make multiple Ultimate R plays.\n\nAfter going in with your Q > E combo, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in team fights."}
{"text": "As rumble, Level six is a massive peak for him and his team. It can now affect the fights easily with its Ultimate b and make sure that the enemies cannot fight him just and square during the fights. The first element will allow him to do a lot of damage to his opponents. It will also be beneficial when he throws his Ultimate b. His early play is good, but the result of the way really depends on the confrontation in which he is. It should have a fairly easy time in the way as long as he can poke enemies systematically."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Kassadin is weak early because he cannot get too close to his opponents to shoot them down. It is mainly because of a lack of mobility and articles until he reaches level 6. To compensate, he should play safely and rely on the correct configuration of the vision to not die often. At level 6, Kassadin will unlock his Ultimate k. It is his first significant peak of power that he can now move away from an enemy according to the given situation. As the game progresses, this ability will play a central role in Kassaddin's success. Once Kassaddin has his first element, he should inflict a lot of brilliant damage to his enemies."}
{"text": "As nidalee, Level 16 won't be a massive spike for Nidalee due to it not providing a lot of stats. It will still help her take over the game due to the increased stats.\n\nShe can pretty much one-shot enemies during this phase of the game. Any squishy who is not careful will get chunked out from the fog of war.\n\nShe will fall off if the enemy team is filled with tanks. This is because she won't burst enemies down and will only act as a heal bot."}
{"text": "Against diana, Diana has a unique game style when it comes to agriculture and commerce during the start of the game. Its impact on the wave is strong and she will tend to push the wave with her. Try to engage and fight it when her s is on the cooldown. Diana is dependent on landing her Q for the all-in. Try to step back if she lands to reduce her chances of following with her t and trade."}
{"text": "As galio, Superb engage potential with his E, along with the extended CC with his W. This combo can deal respectable amounts of damage and also allow his team to follow up on the knocked up target with ease.\n\nHas a decent amount of waveclear on his Q which he can use to shove the wave in and then roam around to see if he can use his Ultimate R to assist other teammates. He doesn\u2019t have to roam too far for this, so he can get back to the lane quickly if the all-in chance disappears.\n\nHis Ultimate R knockup prevents the enemy team from playing in a clustered formation as that could literally get them killed within the next 2.5 seconds. His W plays a pivotal role during team fights in such situations."}
{"text": "As malphite, Putting 3 points in his Ultimate h will be the final nail in the coffin of the enemy team. They won't be able to do anything about the low cooling of his Ultimate h. Malphite is pretty decent in the team fights at the end of the game. That's because his Ultimate h will almost always be at the top, and he can easily use the fog of the war to reach his enemies. He has a lot of versatility in his kit, which allows him to be an invincible juggernaut or a glass cannon that excels at a single shot from the enemy."}
{"text": "As drmundo, His tankiness and health regeneration are unparalleled and quite valuable during late game fights. He can act as a really potent frontline/disruptor for his team and can go directly for the enemy backline.\n\nBeing pushed into the tower isn\u2019t a big hassle for him due to the ease with which he can farm under his tower. The enemy needs to think twice before diving him as he can regenerate a lot of health in a matter of seconds with his Ultimate R.\n\nHis Q can allow him to catch up to targets quite easily. This is invaluable when he is trying to pull off a gank or when he manages to catch an immobile champion out."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Ziggs will try to delay a team fight as long as possible while he launches with his Q. Try to force a fight so that he can't bring you down and force you to disengage. It's going to be hard for you to sit goals like Towers when Ziggs is alive. Try catching him out of his position or flancing him when he's alone to facilitate taking these goals."}
{"text": "Against lucian, Watch Lucians Q as he will try to line him up so he will hit the minion wave and you at the same time. Lucian is very strong in early play and seek to abuse his forces to get an advance. Avoid dying to him so he will not go forward. Wait for Lucian to use his E before starting a fight or trying to land CC. Every time his E is down, he is much weaker and will find it harder for him to defend himself."}
{"text": "As varus, Stay away from his Q poke in this matchup. Use your mobility to avoid it when possible. He will try to shoot you down from a distance before closing to kill him. Use the track brushes to drop the vision on Varus. Since he built Grievous Wounds, you will want to make sure that you do not take prolonged fighting. Keep the wave near your tower and see if you can expose him to ganks."}
{"text": "As quinn, Use the track brushes from time to time to make sure the enemy is forced to stay away from the brushes and the minion wave. Your E must be used very carefully in this matchup that the enemy can easily use their Flash to put you in a compromising position in the middle of the E. Staying parallel to your support is the way to leave. Once you get your Ultimate R, you will be able to make sure that you can wander and choose to kill all around the map. This will make you a nuisance for the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against taric, Taric will look for cheesy plays in your jungle to get kills. Watch as you walk into your own jungle so he doesn\u2019t take you down quickly.\n\nHe can start ganking really early on. Make sure you place wards around the map to spot him before he can get his allies ahead.\n\nTake the Dragons as often as you can! He cannot take them easily alone, so if you can take them before him, you will be helping your team alot.\n"}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Try to fight as a team in the open air so that he is unable to use his E qualified to stun your entire team. Do not fight in the jungle because the size of his E is about the same as the jungle. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, he technically unlocks 3 new abilities. Be careful trying to initiate a skirmish with him because he could just remove his magic card and kill you."}
{"text": "As garen, At level nine, Garen will have his first ability maxed out. This is a decent power spike as it allows him to duel enemies easily and go for regular short burst trades.\n\nOnce he manages to get 2 points in his Ultimate R, he will have an effortless time catching enemies off-guard and killing them. He should use the river brushes to pretend to roam and then turn on the enemy mid-laner if they try to follow.\n\nHis survivability is excellent during the mid-game, and he can run enemies down while peeling for his carries. If he takes a lot of damage, he can quickly back off and let his Passive kick in."}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, Ensure you\u2019re always behind a minion so it is harder for him to land his Q. If he is able to land his Q, he may look for a fight.\n\nAs soon as Tahm Kench activates his Grey Health E, disengage from the fight as it will offer him protection and you may be unable to kill him through the bonus health.t have an impactful 2v2 Ultimate R. If you\u2019re stronger at level 6, be prepared to fight him.\n\nTry and stay at max range and behind minions at all times. This will make it harder for him to poke you with his Q or auto-attack you."}
{"text": "As olaf, Level 6 is a massive peak of power for Olaf as it can now reach its target without being interrupted. If it manages to flank its enemies, the stationary wagons will be pretty much condemned. Its first element will be a massive peak, increasing its overall damage in the game. It will strengthen its overall potential for damage."}
{"text": "As karthus, Play around your ultimate e in the late game. It deals tons of damage and you need it to be up before you engage in a fight. Stay with your team in the game late. Get caught will give your team to have to play 4v5. As you are the Jungler after all, if you die when the Baron is up, the enemy will take it for free. Rush goals as soon as they scare. You should be able to quickly take them through your 1."}
{"text": "As malphite, Divide the thrust during the middle of the game and try to secure the secondary goals. Avoid regrouping when your Ultimate h is down. Group your team when your Ultimate h is up. Rotate from the side lane to where your team is and look for a choice with your Ultimate h. Peel for your allies in team fighting. As you are a tank, you are rather weak unless your aircraft carriers are alive. So keeping them alive is the key in team fighting. Be ready to peel for them when needed."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Make sure you're still on the side of the map that the next major goal is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free. Look to remove the enemy carriers. Focus on the backline and try to get them out of the fight. Focus them on your other front line champions. Even if you're a laner, you can easily get the Baron or the Dragon down on your own. What you want to do is try to get them out of the enemy team while your team is busy trying to distract the enemy."}

He will deal a lot of damage to the enemy, provided he doesn't get poked out early.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as it offers both kills pressure and defensive measures for his lane partner. This means that he can try to all-in the enemy on his own now.\n\nLevel three is another significant power spike as it grants him access to all of his basic abilities. This means that he can do a lot more in the lane while using the lane brushes. He, unfortunately, won't be able to utilize his Passive well enough, though.        "}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is a farm heavy champion and will need to soak up many minion waves and jungle camps to be useful throughout the game. \n\nHis Ultimate e deals basically no damage in the early game. This isn\u2019t good for Karthus as he only wishes to use it when the enemy is super low. During this time, the enemy could have already been killed by your ally, and you wouldn\u2019t get an assist.\n\nChannelling your Ultimate e near an enemy champion could be very dangerous as they could interrupt the channel with CC."}
{"text": "Against nilah, Its first power peak is at level 3. It could look for an aggressive game once it has access to all its basic capabilities. Nilahs second power peak is when it reaches level 6. It will usually hit level 6 before the enemy in the track, so keep this in mind when you are both level 5. Another power peak for Nilah is when it gets its first component element. Nilahs bargaining power will be improved, and it will be stronger in the skirmishes."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Try to delay team fighting as long as possible while you push the enemy down with your E Barrels. Getting a good Barrel E off can help you win the fight. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's a very important ability and you need to make sure it's high before you engage in a fight."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, During the middle of the game, continue to get angry and see if you can get tracks around the map. Your E should be on a shorter cooldown now, which allows you to catch up more easily with your enemies. Neutral Goal fights should see your presence regularly. Your ability to constantly descend from a Smit due to your Ultimate e should allow your team to benefit a lot. Don't forget to grow in the game as it will be your main source of revenue. You will want to get your items as quickly as you can for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he enters with his E, he can't go out due to his E being on a very high cooldown initially. If his Passive is down, he can't play so aggressively because of the threat of his being killed. This is applicable for early fighting in the middle of the game only. Teams with lots of CC and disengagement tools are really good against Zac. He struggles to get targets, use his Ultimate R and make use of his Q when the enemy escaped/ or CC."}
{"text": "As varus, At level 11, Varus will be able to add 2 points into his Ultimate R. This makes it really easy for Varus to pick off enemies, especially when Varus is trying to swap lanes.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will allow him to deal a lot of damage to his opponents in the lane. It will also provide him the incentive to carry for his team if he is already ahead.\n\nVarus' AoE poke and Ultimate R make clumped fights disastrous for the enemy team. They will suffer if Varus manages to get an excellent Ultimate R during neutral, objective fights.        "}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, Try your toughest to harass and intimidate Jarvan down. If he is weak in health, he will be unable to engage. Position level 6, avoid using dashes until his Ultimate m is down. If he enters while your dash is down, it will be impossible for you to escape it without burning Flash."}
{"text": "As teemo, Duel in the middle of the game as much as possible. Your goal is to make sure that the enemy is shot down so that he can't fight. Keep pushing dry when possible. This is very important because it allows you to get a lead on different parts of the map while escaping when you see the enemy collapsing. Although you are a powerful dry pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As sion, An additional point in his Ultimate R will boost his overall damage and let him use the ability frequently. It will help him massively during team fights or when trying to secure picks.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level nine. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be pretty respectable now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability while hiding in a brush.\n\nHis tankiness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will soak up both tower shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow up on his engagement.        "}
{"text": "As nautilus, 2 points in his Ultimate e will allow him to use the ability quite frequently. He will be very deadly if he manages to use it from the fog of the war. Once Nautilus gets several articles, he will absorb a lot of damage while simultaneously helping his team to avoid damage. He can even ride reliable dive during this stage of the game. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. He will be able to g very frequently and make the strategy of death brush viable for his team."}
{"text": "As galio, Be cautious of Galio's level 2 all-in potential on your ADC. Galio can quickly engage and deal significant damage, so be prepared to assist your ADC in disengaging or using your W (You and Me!) to attach and escape.\n\nWhen detaching from your ADC, try to stay close to them. This makes it easier for you to quickly attach back to them with your W and help them escape Galio's engage.\n\nIf Galio roams, ping your teammates to alert them and take advantage of his absence by harassing and pressuring his ADC.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your turret. This reduces Galio's opportunities to engage and makes it harder for him to effectively trade or go all-in."}
{"text": "As briar, She needs her team to follow the team fights or else she'll get blown up. The interaction between her E and W is a bit boring. If she doesn't fight in the jungle or near the walls, she misses on additional CC."}
{"text": "As darius, It should be easy enough if you can bypass the vision defined by the enemy team. When the enemy duel, you must check the enemy inventory so that you do not get bambood by the first Wounds Grievous. You will want to avoid fighting with enemies having such items. You must try to counter gank as much as you can as its kit facilitates. Once you get your ultimate e, you should be extremely effective in the skirmishes."}
{"text": "Against thresh, Stay within reach as much as possible to make it more difficult for him to land his E on you. Getting closer to it will make it difficult for you to escape his Q. Stand behind the minions at all times so it is impossible for him to land his Hook Q. Avoid walking outside the minion wave or at the opening as much as possible. Beware of the installation of Ganks Thresh-S that he can easily install ganks with his W. If he walks near a wall, his Jungler could approach and wait for the W Lantern before moving in."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Always keep an eye on which Ultimate Sylas has. If his Ultimate R is a very strong team fighting Ultimate, try to wait for it to go on cooldown before forcing a fight.\n\nLook out for flanks as Sylas will often try to flank in a team fight with his E to get onto carries.\n\nMake sure no one on your team is stood too far forward or out of position as it may allow Sylas to pick them off his with his E and start the team fight."}
{"text": "As morgana, Use the war fog to get choices with your Q and W. Your E should be on a short cooling so, then use it freely. If you are not the powered one, consider using your E to protect an ally acting like portage. Such an ally getting CC'd will mean disappearance for your team. Before going for neutral goals, try to put a death brush and kill any enemy who decides to blindly check the track brushes. This will help you massively to secure the goals effortlessly."}
{"text": "As darius, When you do team fight, look to peel and focus on the closest enemy champion. You\u2019re Darius, not an assassin and you\u2019ll struggle to kill anyone alone. But, you can soak damage and deal loads at the same time.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, look to split push and try to fight the enemy who tries to stop you. Darius is a strong 1v1 champion and can fight most laners who are put up against him.\n\nUse your Ultimate e at a proper time in every fight. Getting resets on your Ultimate e will increase your chances of winning the fight.        "}
{"text": "Against vayne, If Vayne ever uses her e, use the cooldown to play aggressively and try to kill her. She is rather vulnerable when her e is down. Avoid prolonged exchanges with Vayne as her s will inflict additional damage. Only commit to the exchanges if you are 100% sure that you will win them. One way to abuse Vaynes low early game is by forcing her to stretch out for the farm and then call your Jungler to kill her. Alternatively, you can push her and take turns to win a gold lead."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille can look for an all-in at level 3 or 4 once she has access to her basic abilities. Try and do not lose too much health before hitting level 3 otherwise it is guaranteed that she will look for the all-in. Whenever Camille has her E available, you must be careful with your positioning because it will provide her an opportunity to engage if you are standing near a wall. Stand in the middle of the track as much as possible. At level 6 Camille will have access to her Ultimate R which can be deadly if you are low and overheard. Respect her all-in and do not push without vision as her Ultimate R can also be used to install her Jungler."}
{"text": "As riven, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As teemo, Keep poking him whenever you can in this matchup and keep your resource bar half filled as much as possible.\n\nDo not fight in clumped spaces unless you have cleared it off Teemo's traps. The damage you will otherwise take will probably get you killed.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks.\n\nTeemo really doesn't have much that he can do against you in this matchup as you are mostly ability based, making his Blind quite useless."}
{"text": "As xayah, Avoid going for prolonged exchanges with Xayah early on. She will usually win them. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card early on. It will protect you and make the matchup a little safer. Focus on poking and harassing with your Q and W early on. During the fight, take care and be on the lookout for her E. At level 6, she has more pressure to kill than you, and she can turn around the fights."}
{"text": "As jax, Get to level three really fast and start to glove quickly. Your goal is to look out for weak health targets and finish them when you get the chance. Once you get your first element, you should be able to flatten much more damage and counter-gank way more frequently. Ward around correctly and follow the enemy Jungler non-stop. Your Ultimate t will play a vital role in the game against the enemy team. It will allow you to use your Passive effectively but always try to get rid of the enemy rear line and catch them out of sight by surprise using the fog of war."}
{"text": "Against nunu, When it comes to getting a goal like the Dragon or the Baron, never go for the 50/50. Due to Nunus Q, he will win every battle. Try to take the goal when he is dead or on the other side of the map. Nunu is rather still when it comes to team combat (once the fight has started). Lock him up with crowd control and kite him during the team fight so that he is unable to be the front line and climb to your portages. Do not tighten together when it comes to team combat. If you are close to each other, he will use his Snowball W to engage from afar and run in the enemy. If you are all close to each other - he could be able to mount a 5 person."}
{"text": "Against zyra, Zyra is strong at level 3 as she has access to both her Q and E. Expect her to dish out a lot of damage in a trade.\n\nOnce Zyra hits level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, her kill pressure increases dramatically and she can one-shot the squishiest of champions.\n\nAfter Zyra has completed Liandry\u2019s, her damage output intensifies. Watch out for her poke damage in lane. "}
{"text": "As gangplank, When there is no team fight, push and draw the enemy's attention to you while your team sits or plays on the other side of the card. Be sure to continue growing during the middle of the game so you can upgrade your Ultimate R and win more gold. Keep a constant eye on the card during the middle of the game so you can help your allies with your Ultimate R when appropriate."}
{"text": "As darius, At level 9, Darius would\u2019ve maxed out his e. His all-in potential and kill pressure is still very good during the mid-game.\n\nAt level 11, Darius will put a secondary point in his Ultimate e. If he gained a slight lead in the early game, he will be tough to handle in the mid-game, and he should be able to kill any enemy who tries to prevent him from split pushing.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Darius should\u2019ve completed a couple of items. He should be able to deal a lot of damage to targets, and also be somewhat tanky. The items he picks up makes him a huge problem during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Kassadin will be split pushing during the mid-game so he can get to his level 16 power spike and then try to flank in team fights with his Ultimate k. \n\nIf you see that Kassadin is split pushing, you could try and start a team fight with the numbers advantage as he will be unable to join the fight quickly.\n\nAvoid stalling the game out for too long as Kassadin is a late-game monster. Try to end the game as quickly as you can."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio is a champion of melee and can easily be abused by various Supports and the ADC enemy. This makes it difficult for him to run against the poke champions. Moreover, he can easily be interrupted by the enemy if he wants to engage with his E. If he misses it, he will be easily killed too. In a 2v2 frame, his Ultimate R cannot be super valuable compared to other Supports. He does not do much damage like other Supports, and it can be difficult to use in the battle mix."}
{"text": "As taric, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nLook for picks during the mid-game. If you can pick someone off with the help from your allies, you can abuse their death timer to earn more gold and possibly take a tower, an objective or get more kills."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Disengage is your best friend when dealing with Neeko and her Ultimate R in team fights. Disengage as soon as Neeko walks forward and tries to engage to minimize the usefulness of her Ultimate R.\n\nWard your flanks and nearby bushes when sieging objectives as Neeko may use her Passive and W to get a good engage off with her Ultimate R.\n\nSplitting up and not standing too close together will help reduce how many people Neeko and stun with her Ultimate R. Group when team fighting, but don\u2019t stand too close together."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Once Yasuo hits level 11, his Ultimate R will have two points in it. This will allow him to deal more damage and will also let him deal with tanks more efficiently as the game goes on.\n\nAt level 9, Yasuo will have maxed out his r. This is an excellent power spike for Yasuo as his damage output increases massively and his r tornado poke increases drastically. The lane brushes will help you a lot with this as well.\n\nHis mid-game power spike is dependent on his team comp as well. Yasuo will be able to do a lot more in the game with ease if Yasuo's team has a form of knockup on any of their champions. Having a Jungler or roaming mid-laner with a knockup will make Yasuo's laning phase very easy."}
{"text": "Against diana, When it's weak in mana, it's not a threat to you because its kit requires a lot of mana to trade effectively. When it's weak, there's your chance to fight. During team fights, Diana's kit offers a lot of brilliant damage thanks to its Ultimate R. Try to bring it down before it engages to make it really difficult for her to engage and kill anyone."}
{"text": "As morgana, When Morgana gets tired, if she misses her Q, she's basically useless and the gank will fail. This makes it important for you to pose your Q. If you don't use your E correctly during fighting or in team fighting, you will get killed (or your allies will get killed)."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Kayn will try to assassinate targets that are alone during the middle of the game. Avoid walking alone through the river if you are not sure about Kayn's location. Kayn can dive tour while sitting with his E. Make sure you have your flanks monitored so you can spot him before he jumps on you or your team."}
{"text": "As neeko, Don't fight at the end of the game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available because you're going to miss the extra damage and CC. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooling time in the last stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your efforts to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As zed, Your goal in the laning phase is to abuse the enemy and get murders. Try to play aggressive when appropriate to get an early advance. Use your strong 1v1 potential to travel the map and help your allies kill safely. If you can get murders and help your allies, your chances of winning the game will be much higher. Once your allies have turned towards the average path, turn to another way and split thrust. It is important that you do not fall behind in CS and XP by staying in the middle when there are many other champions there."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Once Fiddlesticks has his Zhonya, it allows his R to really hit at home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonya, you can't attack him when he goes into the stasis. When Fiddlesticks has access to 3 abilities, it's really hard to manage because they offer him so much utility. If you're trying to go for a whole in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing. Of course, Fiddlesticks' biggest power peak is his 6. You can counter him by having constant guards around your track. If he's going to miss position 6, ping your teammates."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Like most champions, Gragas spikes again at level 6 as his Ultimate R is a really good tool when it comes to ganking. Expect him to gank overextended lanes whenever he is level 6.\n\nAlways keep an eye on what items he\u2019s buying. Gragas can go tank or can build a lot of AP. If he\u2019s going AP, respect his damage output.\n\nWhenever Gragas has his E up, he is a bigger threat and you need to position and play safely. If he uses his E and it misses, you can look to turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "As rengar, Focus on farming early. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.\n\nHowever, if you do find a ganking or counter-ganking opportunity nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to take it.\n\nIf they invade you early, just back off; you do not win early skirmishes with them.\n\nTry to secure those major objectives when you can, as you have decent objective control. You could gank bot, then take Drake afterwards."}
{"text": "As ekko, Play safe for the first few levels. While Ekko\u2019s early game is strong, you need to remain healthy so you can look for an all-in after you have more levels under your belt.\n\nEkko has strong roaming potential and is a strong skirmisher. Get priority in your lane and then look to roam and assist your allies.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate W. It is a strong tool that can help win fights and outplay the enemy. Always keep this ability in mind when you\u2019re fighting the enemy."}
{"text": "As akali, If Akali is weak on HP, look for a whole as soon as you touch Level 6 because it won't be able to trade with you. Don't bother using your W unless Akali comes to you with its E. Save this ability for this exact scenario so you can turn around the trade. As your Q has high cooling in the first levels, make sure you don't put yourself in danger while it's on cooldown because it's your main damaging ability. Once it's down, play safer and try not to trade with Akali because you will have no damage. The best time to fight Akali is when it's low on energy."}
{"text": "As malphite, Just hide in the lane brush early on and wait for enemies to come near. Once they come close, d them and run away.\n\nRemember that you are not going to be doing anything till you hit level six. Ensure that your health is saved up so that you can all-in enemies as soon as you manage to get to level six.\n\nGetting your Ultimate h will allow you to do a lot more in the lane. Now you can roam and use the lane brushes to kill the enemy bot lane.        "}
{"text": "Against fizz, Fizz has good kill pressure at level 3 and 4. Respect his all-in and try to poke him down before he gets the chance to play aggressive. \n\nFizz's Playful / Trickster E allows him to dodge damage and escape from trades. Do not go for all-ins unless he has already used this ability beforehand so you\u2019re guaranteed to hit your abilities on him.\n\nKeep an eye on your XP bar between levels 5 and 6. If you think Fizz is going to hit level 6 first, try to stay at max distance and play safer. When Fizz hits level 6, his kill pressure intensifies and he can easily kill you if you\u2019re level 5 and are overextended."}
{"text": "As vi, Vi's first games are decent enough because of her Q. She will just have to play with the vision to make sure it is not detected while loading her Q. Level 6 is a massive power peak for Vi. She will be able to distinguish the enemies and break them out. The CC is quite beneficial as well as it helps her team to follow Vi's commitment. Vi has a great objective control with her Passive, W and E. This means that it will melt through the goals and take the game completely."}
{"text": "As graves, Graves is not quite strong during the early game because the enemy can use the minions to block his attacks. He can compensate for this by systematically clearing the wave and using his e in a way that he can reposition himself correctly to attack his laner. Once he arrives at level 6, he will have unlocked a huge finishing movement. He can remove several targets with the utmost ease if he goes for the construction of the lethality. The ability also provides him a way to escape when his e is down. Graves will get a decent peak of power once he has his first component. He will increase his duel potential, and he will be close to the phase where he can practically a-shot anyone."}
{"text": "As ashe, At level 16, Ashe will have 3 points in her Ultimate w. It will also be on a much lower cooldown (on a cooldown lower than the enemy will think). This allows her to get surprising choices to win the late match for her team. In the later parts of the game, Ashe will be at the maximum or almost max build. Its damage release will be incredibly high if she can 1, poke the enemy with her y, 2 activate her Q and 3, kite in the fights of the late game team."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton is an early dominant champion of the game. Expects that he plays aggressive and goes to kill. Every time Renekton is above 50 Fury, his next ability will be empowered. Stay at a maximum distance so he can't get an e or e empowered on you. Avoid fighting when he has tons of Fury too. Don't underestimate Renekton's reach with his Dash e. He can use it on the minion wave to close the gap and trade with you."}
{"text": "As galio, Stay close to your team at any time in the late game. While your Ultimate R has a long range, the enemy can force a fight when you show elsewhere on the map. Play around your Ultimate R and wait for one of your allies to commit. Once they have entered, use your Ultimate R on them. Otherwise, wait for the enemy to commit and then throw your Ultimate R on a cart. Peel for your portages in the late game team fights."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Once Neeko has her Ultimate R, her kill pressure will increase. Make sure you back when you\u2019re low when she has her Ultimate R up.\n\nNeeko can deal a lot of burst damage if she\u2019s able to land her E on you. Position towards the opposite side of the lane and as far back as possible to make it harder for her to land this ability on you.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave at all times if possible. Neeko\u2019s root from her E will be increased if she is able to throw it through the minion wave."}
{"text": "As leona, Group and stay with your team. Go to the hall when you know where the enemy is in order not to be chosen and killed before an objective spawning. Look for choices with your ultimate e. Leona can quickly force goals or team fights with ease if she can catch someone who walks too far forward. Peel and protect your allies as much as possible in mid-game team fights. If you let them die, it will be difficult for your team to win the fight. After engaging, retreat and peel for your ADC."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, At level 6, Mordekaisers kill pressure increases. Every time his Ultimate R is at the top, you have to play more respectfully. Mordekaiser has a strong all-in-all potential as soon as it reaches level 3, but before it can be pushed out of the way. Abuse it as much as possible before it touches level 3. Team fighting is where Mordekaiser can shine. If you are a carrier champion, make sure to invest in a QSS so you can get out of his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As hwei, At level 9, you will max out your first ability. This ability\u2019s damage will increase significantly at this stage, which will help you win fights.\n\nYou\u2019re good in team fights due to your AOE abilities. Teams will be grouped in the mid-game so that you will be strong at this game stage.\n\nAt level 11, you\u2019ll put an additional point in your R. Use this advantage to get picks in the mid-game.\n"}
{"text": "As quinn, Its level 6 power peak is not as strong as many other ADCs. Keep this in mind during the laning phase. It is strong during the early laning phase thanks to its passive strength and all-in-one. When Quinn finishes its first component, its trading power in the track and its ability to go for the trades increases considerably."}
{"text": "As rumble, Another point in his Ultimate b will seriously tip team fights in chokepoints into his favor. All he needs to do is time it well and drop it at the proper places.\n\nHe will now have multiple items at his disposal. This means that his damage will increase significantly, and he should have an easy time melting through enemy health bars.\n\nRumble's presence during mid-game fights is really fabulous. He should be able to win multiple fights just by using his Ultimate b properly.        "}
{"text": "Against azir, Azir will try to delay a team fight and shoot you down with his W as much as possible before his team starts. Do not let him shoot you down by starting the fight as soon as possible rather than delaying it. CC is your best friend to counter his engagement and Shurima Shuffle. If he enters, try and CC him as soon as possible to stop him and prevent him from pushing your team towards his. After his first back, Azir will push constantly. Try and choose champions who have the pressure to kill and can match his clear wave so that you don't lose your Tour early."}
{"text": "As soraka, Harass the enemy throughout the laning phase with your Q. Your goal is to constantly harass the enemy whenever possible and get kills.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead. Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the objective to make it easier to secure the mid lane tower.\n\nKeep a constant eye on the minimap and your allies health. Use your Ultimate R on allies that are low and have the potential to turn around and win the fight or survive. Avoid wasting your Ultimate R on allies that are going to die even with your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As hwei, At level 9, you maximize your first ability. This ability will significantly increase at this stage, which will help you win fights. You are good in team fights because of your AOE abilities. The teams will be grouped in the middle of the game so that you will be strong at this stage of play. At level 11, you will put an additional point in your Ultimate. Use this advantage to get choices in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As lulu, Team up with your team during this phase of the game and make sure you can land consistent DPS on enemies. Your ultimate R should be saved for yourself, but exceptions are applicable if one of your doors is in danger. Use your W wisely during this phase of the game. This ability can completely change the result of a fight if you use it at a good time. An appropriate time would be to ruin the combo of complete damage of a mage by W 'ing them. During neutral, objective fighting, stay somewhere near your Jungler so that they are not taken off during or before a fight. Losing crucial goals will certainly lead to your loss if you are not careful enough."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Working with your Jungler and see if you can secure some peaks around the map. Getting a murder is good, but you can also try to force the enemy to remember. You are extremely fragile and you will probably die if you are taken out, so make sure you use your E with discretion. Your Ultimate R will be on an extremely short cooling now so use it as much as you want to help your teammates."}
{"text": "Against talon, The most gold that Talon gets, the strongest it will be. Even with one blow, he can easily snowball his lead. Avoid giving him kills when possible. Once he has finished his first element and when he has unlocked his Ultimate R, Talon's power increases considerably and his skirmish force will be unstoppable. Avoid fighting 1v1 unless you have an advantage. Talon has the same peaks of power in the jungle as in the middle track."}
{"text": "As tristana, Just like in the middle of the game, you have to stay with your support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone because you will die easily. Do not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and automatic attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will concentrate and down you. Continue kiteing in team fights and systematically adapt your positioning."}
{"text": "As milio, You have a strong poke in early play with your automatic attacks and your Q. Continue harassing the enemy from get-go. At level 3, you will have access to all your basic abilities. It is one of your first major powerpikes in early play. Your level 6 power peak is quite major because it can help you and your ADC stay safe in the way."}
{"text": "As galio, When no team fights are occurring, split push and draw the enemies attention to you while your team sieges or makes plays on the other side of the map.\n\nKeep a constant eye on the map during the mid-game so you can assist your allies with your Ultimate R when appropriate. \n\nTry and always stay somewhat near your team so you can use your Ultimate R to help them. One way you can achieve this is by pushing a side lane with your Q and then running towards them while the wave keeps pushing."}
{"text": "As olaf, Olaf is excellent at the end of the game, because his tankness will be phenomenal now. Combined with his overall damage, it will become difficult to deal with him for the enemy team. The last point in his Ultimate k will grant him a massive point, and he will be able to pay tons of damage to the enemy. Since the ability will increase frequently, he will be able to take targets easily. Olaf will have several capabilities maximized during this phase of the game. The amount of damage he can do now will really be high and will probably catch the out-of-guard enemy."}
{"text": "As poppy, Level 16 isn't that great because she won't be getting a lot except for a reduced cooldown on her Ultimate R. It won't be as strong as other ultimates.\n\nHer tankiness will be out of bounds during this phase of the game. She can keep soaking damage and act as a reliable frontline for her team in fights.\n\nShe will have a lot of items during this phase of the game. It will make her tanky and will let her dive face-first into the enemy team. She will play a massive role in disrupting team fights for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan's level 2 all-in is pretty good. Once it unlocks both its d and e, it can look for a favorable business. Depending on its construction path, it can either do a lot of damage, be incredibly tanky, or offer its team a lot of utility. Everything depends on its construction! This makes Jarvan incredibly versatile. Its Ultimate m is really good in team fighting because it can lock several enemy champions at once."}
{"text": "As orianna, Post 6, keep away from her ball sometimes so she can't use her Ultimate on you. This will be an agriculture game, especially in early play. Focus on agriculture and limit the fights until you have your first article. Stay away from the minion wave at all times so they can't push you and punch you at the same time."}
{"text": "As teemo, He can roam around the map and place his Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow him to detect enemies as well as get kills on unsuspecting low health targets.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let him deal hefty amounts of burst damage and will let him kill his enemies quickly.\n\nHe isn't outstanding in team fights, so he should either resort to securing picks and blowing people up with his abilities or just split pushing till the enemy responds to him.        "}
{"text": "As talon, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nThey can secure objective so much easier than you can. Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nPost 6, avoid fighting them at all costs as they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will easily kill you.\n\nHe will be ganking a lot early on. Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As morgana, Watch your positioning so she cannot land her Q on you. Stand behind the minion wave at all times.\n\nFocus on farming and poking. Limit tradin with her.\n\nStand away from the minion wave. Morgana\u2019s will use their W to push the minion wave. Stand outside of the wave so she can\u2019t push and poke at the same time.\n\nHer kill pressure increases at 6. Stand far back so it gives you more time to react to her Q so you can dodge it."}
{"text": "As masteryi, A maximum of Ultimate r will allow Master Yi to mow the enemy team. This is very beneficial when it comes to cleaning up late battles. His damage will be massive during the end of the game. He can continue on all enemies that his Ultimate r will rise quite frequently. His team fight is on another level during this phase of the game. This means that he will be the pivot for the success of his team, and his use will determine the result of the game."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia is one of the most immobile champions of the game. Cassiopeia is therefore a target of choice for the ganks and teams with good diving potential. When against mobile champions like Talon, Lee Sin, Rengar, it will be really difficult for her to land her Q, make use of her W and escape a trade. She fights against enemies who move quickly."}
{"text": "Against rakan, Rakan has a strong level 1. Watch your positioning as he can look for an aggressive level 1 game with his W and force yourself to blow a Summoning Sort. Similarly, pay attention to his level 2 all-in. When Rakan bought Mobility Boots, his roaming potential increases considerably. Ping every time he misses because he is a very good roaming champion. Rakan is really good in the middle of the game and in team fights."}
{"text": "As brand, Once Brand reaches level 3, he can technically start to ruin his allies. But, he has to make sure that he can land his Q otherwise, practically every gank will fail. At level 6, Brand will unlock his Ultimate R. At this stage of the game, even if he cannot land his Q during the ganking, he can still do a ton of damage thanks to his Ultimate R alone. After Brand has finished his Mythic article, he will become a real threat. Ganks will be much easier and he will be able to flatten a lot of damage in a short time."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan does not do too well in the various matchesups and champions with easy to land CC because he will be unable to use his E aggressively. Its Ultimate can be interrupted quite easily. You must be very careful when you try to use it otherwise the enemy will cancel his channel. Versus poke or champions with a lot of clear wave, it will be almost impossible for you to wander and help your allies as the enemy will keep you pushed in or take your turn while you are roaming."}
{"text": "As fizz, Go for extended trades with him whenever possible. Just make sure you keep your distance.\n\nTry to kite as much as possible. If he gets in range, W away to create distance and then continue to auto-attack him.\n\nDo not W directly on to him. You need to reserve your W to escape his engage.\n\nUsually you\u2019ll look for an all-in at level 2. You can\u2019t do this vs fizz as he has good turn around potential.\n"}
{"text": "As viktor, Very efficient wave clear which also allows him to damage multiple enemies at the same time. This gives him an innate advantage against ranged matchups, as well as lane priority in general.\n\nCan disrupt an entire fight with his d and Ultimate m, so fighting in close spaces is very advantageous for him. He can also chase a single target down with some fancy footwork, by using his r.\n\nHis poke damage is obnoxious and very strong. This can allow him to force his enemy laner out of the lane and then take objectives with a numbers advantage. In the bot lane, he can use the lane brushes for an added effect of obscurity from enemy laners."}
{"text": "As skarner, His first games are decent, but he should focus on the enemies who are quite pushed up. This way, she won't have to rely much on her CC to win the game. Level 6 is the pick of power removal that will allow Skarner to win games easily. All he needs to do is lock the highest priority target and bring them to his team."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, Ward your flanks like Mordekaiser can try to attack on the side to get on a high-value target with his Ultimate R. If Mordekaiser misses his E in a team fight, it would not be a bad time to focus it because he will be unable to shoot your team in when his E is on the cooldown. Avoid starting major goals like the Baron or a Dragon when Mordekaiser is nearby because he can take your Jungler into the Shadow Realm with his R that will make it take the risky goal."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Be careful around the minion wave as Yasuo will often use its E to pass through the minion wave to reach you. Stay outside and away from the minion wave at all times. Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card early. This will reduce its ability to play aggressively and look for an all-in. Good time to use CC capabilities or trading with Yasuo is when it is overstretched after using its E. You could use its bad positioning to go for a favorable trade to make it low."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Disengagement as soon as Neeko advances and tries to minimize the utility of his Ultimate R. Watch your flanks and bushes nearby when you sit targets like Neeko can use his Passive and W to get a good engagement with his Ultimate R. Splitting and not being too close together will help reduce the number of Neeko people and amaze with his Ultimate R. Group during team fighting, but don't stay too close together."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, In the mid-game, Blitzcrank\u2019s b will be on a somewhat shorter cooldown. This is very beneficial for Blitzcrank as it will allow him to use his b over and over again if he misses the first Hook b.\n\nAs teams will start grouping during the mid-game, Blitz\u2019s Ultimate d will be a very useful tool as it can silence multiple enemies at once. Silencing the right enemy or multiple enemies could provide his team with adequate time to dish out damage or reposition. \n\nBlitzcrank should\u2019ve completed an item or two by this stage of the game. He will be much tankier which will allow him to soak up lots of damage for his teammates."}
{"text": "As karma, It has excellent wave damage and splashing with its Q. This allows it to obtain the priority of the track and to help its other langers/Jungler when they contest the objectives. Its d allows it to protect everyone in its team. It also allows it to increase the speed of movement of the allied team, which can help them catch an overcrowded enemy. When it fights 1 v 1, it has virtually no weakness when all its spells are lifted. If someone tries to approach it, it can just Q them and escape, If she engages, she can use her d and Ultimate has both the ability to disengage and regain a great deal of health. Her Ultimate is the backbone of her strength in the way and an appropriate use will allow her to move forward."}
{"text": "As renekton, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "Against gangplank, Try to close Gangplank early with the help of your Jungler. Gangplank will eventually overtake you in the progress of the game, so putting it back will make it harder for him to take control of the card. Do not engage with my trades when Gangplanks Passive is in place. He will help him win trades, so wait for him to use it on a minion before trying to fight. Wait for Gangplank to blow up his Barrels E before trying to fight. If he has a placed in a nearby bush or has a under him, wait for him to blow before trying to fight."}
{"text": "Against swain, At level 6, Swain\u2019s damage output and survivability increases. You shouldn\u2019t commit to a fight with him unless you can burst him down quickly as his Ultimate R will offer him extra protection and health regeneration.\n\nSwain\u2019s early game is abusable as he is really weak early on. Once the mid-game hits, you\u2019ll have to play more respectable.\n\nHe is really good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Bursting him down at the start of the fight will make it difficult for him to deal damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Once level 6, Maokai is an excellent tool for throwing ganks. At level 3, Maokai can start playing more aggressively as it will have access to all its basic capabilities. Maokai is good in team fighting because its Ultimate R has a large effect zone. Make sure to separate or disengage as soon as you see it so it is unable to use this ability."}
{"text": "As malzahar, He will now have his core of objects, which means that he will have a lot of mana and spam his Q and W. Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to make frequent use of capacity and make crucial choices. His silence will also be invaluable. Malzahar is pretty good during team fighting as he can silence enemies and can lock high priority targets without effort."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan can look for an early aggressive game once he unlocks his Q and E. He can look for an aggressive game if he has been able to intimidate the enemy down to level 1. One Akshan has supported and recovered his first component element, his release of damage and his ability to trade increases. He should look for aggressive games once he has brought his first component element. Level 6 is good for Akshan. That's because he unlocks his Ultimate. He can help him kill and execute the enemy lantern."}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz is an incredibly weak champion up to level 3. If he gets shot, he won't be able to look for an all-in early or the first blood. Even if he's incredibly mobile with his E, when he's on the cooldown, he's incredibly squissy and still. Even with his E available, he's pretty squishy if he gets hit with CC. Fizz has to go ahead early to do well in the last stages of the game. If he loses the track or doesn't have a lot of gold, he won't be much threat in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As renekton, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate t is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate t is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Really strong dueling potential in the lane thanks to his W. This ability allows him to both block damage as well as heal himself by a respectable amount.\n\nPost-six, he can select any target and convert the fight into a 1 v 1. This can mean hell for any immobile or low health enemy carry as Mordekaiser can easily E>Q them.\n\nOnce he gets enough items, he will be nearly unkillable unless the enemy team focuses him down. In a team fight, his E can be extremely beneficial when fighting against clumped enemy teams."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Always try to go-in and take the enemy Jungler every chance you get. Doing so will allow you to take neutral goals easily. Peeling for your carts during the fights will be really important in this matchup. Always stay by your carts and make sure no one can get to them. Your ultimate e will allow you to lock and kill door with ease. Doing so in bottlenecks will easily win you the game."}
{"text": "As naafiri, At level 16, you\u2019ll put the third and final point in your Ultimate. You will be rather strong and your all-in potential will be high.\n\nIn the late game, you\u2019ll start to fall off a bit as teams will be grouped so you need to play with your team. The enemy grouping together will reduce your chances of getting picks.\n\nNaturally, you\u2019ll have many items completed, or are full build at this stage of the game, so you should be able to deal a lot of damage and survive fights.\n"}
{"text": "As pyke, The first item component will allow him to deal tons of damage to his opponent, and trading will eventually become more accessible for him. Regular burst trades enable Pyke to easily win the lane.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as he can now execute champions with his Ultimate R. This means that he can quickly kill his laner or any other squishy with one rotation of his spells and his Ultimate R.\n\nPyke is a decent early game champion. He can blow up enemies, can roam around relentlessly, and secure picks everywhere on the map. It will allow him to capitalize and come out on top of his enemies.        "}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Every time he has 3 Q laps up, he will always be a threat. At level 6, when Heimerdinger unlocks his Ultimate R, he basically gets 3 new abilities. Take care trying to fight him as he could just use any of his abilities to trade with you."}
{"text": "As diana, Its main goal will be to fight around crowded areas to get a multi-man Ultimate R on the enemy team. It should always focus on the enemy backline during team fighting while avoiding any form of CC on it. Choosing enemies to make team fighting unfair should also be an excellent way of snowballing its head. If Diana is ahead, she should look for picks or ambushing the enemy as they walk through their Jungle. Taking an enemy might be enough to win the next fight or take the Baron."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Maokai is at its lowest level at the beginning of the game. Look for an early advantage to force it to miss on gold and XP. Once Maokai is level 3, it can start trading with you once it has all its basic capabilities. Try to lower it so it is unable to look for a favorable trade. Avoid standing up to the upper side of the track if you know it has placed Saplings E in them. However, you could walk towards it before running to -Bait."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Stay with your Support throughout the middle of the game. If you get away from them, you'll be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you're always close to at least 1 ally. Group and stay with your team at all times. Do not divide the thrust or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them. Look for choices with your Support/Jungler to get killed and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is super squishy and immobile. Good times to trade with him are when he\u2019s walked forward trying to harass.\n\nWhen laning, make sure you\u2019re always stood far back but in front of your Caster Minions. This will make it impossible for him to land his Root E and CC you.\n\nAt level 6, his kill pressure and survivability increases. Unless you have the advantage, disengage as soon as he activates his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As lillia, Continue playing around your Ultimate R to get more kills and more picks. Picking off the right target can let you take the Baron or Dragon.\n\nKeep trying your hardest to secure objectives with your team so you can gain an overall advantage over the enemy.\n\nContinue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!"}
{"text": "As zilean, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nLook for picks in the mid-game. You deal lots of damage and can easily blow champions up. Try to kill someone and then abuse their death timer to earn more gold."}
{"text": "As trundle, Extremely dependent on teammates to shoot successful ganks that can sometimes force him on the farm and be ineffective during the early game. Although his Ultimate cannot allow him to steal statistics, he is still weak without articles and can be stopped early if the enemy Jungler or Laner manages to kill him once or twice. He can easily be tainted by carts tidyed up once his e has been exhausted. This obliges him to retreat or die, if Trundle finds himself in overextending without any follow-up from his team."}
{"text": "As ekko, Do not separate from them or get away from them otherwise the enemy may try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Avoid fighting in the late game unless your Ultimate R or Zhonya. Hurglass is in place. Do not fight or hug with the enemy until they are both. Being killed could cost you the game. Playing on the side of the card that has the next major goal up so you can turn to take it with your team. Otherwise, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bots side of the card and use it to get it to your team."}
{"text": "As shaco, It can easily hide somewhere and use its clone to crush the enemies and inflict free damage on them. Its first ability will be maximized at level 9. This makes it really difficult for the enemy to catch it during all the ins, and Shaco will easily be able to inflict a lot of damage without taking a lot of return. Shaco is really good to get peaks with the team during this phase of the game. It can easily set up death brushes and use its x to pull the enemies before a neutral and objective fight."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Vel'Koz is huge in team fighting, especially those that occur near the objective pits. This is mainly because the entangled fighting allows Vel'Koz to hit several targets with its capabilities and procedures. The obtaining of 2 points in its Ultimate R at level 11 will be another significant peak of power. It can now melt through the enemy rear-line and front line with all the damage it will inflict. More items mean more damage for Vel'Koz. This will only do better for him, and his team and Vel'Koz will slowly start to take over from here."}
{"text": "As maokai, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive games. You enjoy extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "Against lulu, Lulu's early game can be incredibly hard to play against if you are a melee champion. Opt for support and defensive statistics in the early game. Once Lulu has finished his first element, his protection and shielding ability will increase dramatically. At this stage, she will also make a huge amount of damage during trading. Team fights are where Lulu shines thanks to his E and Ultimate R that can be used on his allies."}
{"text": "As skarner, He can kidnap carries or displace teams with his Ultimate. Pulling a carry or isolating someone could easily result in your team getting a pick and a kill.\n\nAs the game develops, he will deal a lot of damage and also be very tanky. He can absorb a lot of damage for his team while being a major threat at the same time.\n\nCan assist his allies, split push and be a real pain for the enemy. His E can be really hard to play against especially in the mid game.\n"}
{"text": "As leblanc, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn't be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have a few levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You get broken jobs, so try to go for them frequently. Push the wave and look for roaming opportunities. Leblanc is a very good traveling champion who can impact the map and help its allies with ease."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Caitlyn is a great late-game champion. As long as you can kite on her, you will be incredibly potent in late game team fights.\n\nAt level 16, Cait will put the third and final point in her Ultimate R. This is a good spike for her as she can use it to finish off higher health targets. But, just like in the mid-game, she cannot use it during a team fight which is one of her many downfalls.\n\nIn the late game, Cait would\u2019ve reached 100% crit strike. She will be able to dish out a lot of damage in team fights and she will be able to take down tanks easier than ever. Just make sure you\u2019re positioning correctly so they don\u2019t take you down and you\u2019re good to go."}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen wins global card pressure at level 6 as his Ultimate R can be used to help any of his allies. With this in mind, ping once he reaches level 6. Shen is actually strong at level 2 if he can get a good engagement with his E. He can be strong at level 1 if he starts E too. He is really good in the middle of the game because his kit is very versatile and can be used to start fighting, bait enemies and save his allies. He will also be stronger than the game goes along, he will be more tankier and tankier."}
{"text": "Against zyra, When she goes to ward objectives, ambush her and take her down before the team fight starts so the enemy lacks crowd control and damage. This can help swing the team fight in your favour.\n\nAvoid moving through unwarded areas in the map as Zyra has great catch potential with her E and Ultimate R. Do not move through unwarded high traffic areas if you don\u2019t know where Zyra is.\n\nDo not fight in the jungle or around an objective like the Dragon or Baron as your team will be quite close together which could allow her to get a multi-person E and Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against senna, Extended trades against Senna will help you in the long run. She doesn\u2019t have the best sustain and her auto-attack speed is very low. Capitalise on this by looking for long-winded trades when possible.\n\nExpect Senna to go for an aggressive level 1 play in order to get stacks. Try not to let her poke you down too much otherwise you\u2019ll not be able to trade at level 2 or 3.\n\nOnce Senna unlocks her Ultimate R, communicate with your team and tell them that she can impact a fight with her Ultimate R. "}
{"text": "Against camille, Try to stand in the middle of the way at all times. This will make it harder for her to land her E in a trade. Do not approach the walls because it will give her the opening to engage. If you play like a varied champion, try to harass Camille with basic attacks every time she tries to hit last. Camille lacks support in the game early, so you can get her out of the way easily if you continue the automatic attack. If Camille uses her E in the way, she will be vulnerable while he is about to cool."}
{"text": "As hecarim, If you're ever invaded, make sure it doesn't have a lot of Q batteries. If it does, expect a lot of damage coming from your way. Don't let the enemy Jungler get all the Dragons. Try to secure them with your team after ruining the lower track. Beware of the potential invasion of Hecarim's early game. They can invade you often, so you have to be ready. Be careful what happens on the map at all times. Beware of Hecarim's early play pressure. They are much stronger than you and will try to make games to get themselves and their teammates in advance."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac becomes really powerful during the middle of the game. That's because it can multiple CC targets and secure many choices with its capabilities. Level 11 is another peak of power as it increases the damage inflicted by Zac to grouped enemies. It also has lower cooling, which means that it can obviously all enemies. At level 9, it will have its first maximum ability. This means that it will either have a massive reach advantage for gank enemies, or it will do a lot of damage to enemies close to it."}
{"text": "Against galio, When Galio loads towards you, try to disengage as quickly as possible. If you let him approach, he will try to engage with his E and then tease you with his W. As soon as Galio loses the 6 position level, ping your team as he might be looking to go with his Ultimate R. If you are a varied champion, use your range advantage to harass and bring him down every time he moves towards the last shot."}
{"text": "Against sion, Sion will look to cheese the bush of the bot track at level 1. Do not walk near the bushes at level 1 so that it does not get an early health benefit. Always stand towards the opposite of the track so it is very difficult for Zion to use its Q on you. When it reaches level 6, avoid overextendance or use any movement tool as dashes as it can throw its Ultimate R and get you down."}
{"text": "Against azir, Avoid standing too close to Azir\u2019s Soldiers W as he can auto attack you from afar. When he places a Soldier W, move to a safer position out of its range.\n\nGo for a trade after Azir\u2019s Soldier W has disappeared. It\u2019s best to wait for the Soldiers W to disappear first before fighting him as his damage output will be decreased. \n\nAfter level 6 keep a keen eye on the map and Azir\u2019s mana bar. If you spot the enemy Jungler nearby, back away as Azir might try to Shurima Shuffle and set up his Jungler."}
{"text": "As thresh, As soon as Thresh gets to the lane, the race for level two ensues. This is because Thresh's level two is devastatingly strong and can immediately get him a kill.\n\nLevel 6 is another massive power spike. This is because he can slow multiple targets easily and easily trap an isolated target within the walls and prevent them from escaping.\n\nGetting his Mobility boots will be another massive power spike. This will be quite beneficial and will allow him to roam around quite effectively as his kit allows him to do so."}
{"text": "Against nunu, Nunu is going to be roaming an awful lot in the laning phase. Ping when he goes missing so your team knows that he could be headed their way.\n\nKeep the wave pushed into his tower. You can secure tower plates and get a significant XP and gold lead while he runs around the map.\n\nTry to counter Nunu roams when possible, but if you can\u2019t, make sure you do as much as you can while he\u2019s not in lane (such as pushing, roaming somewhere else, helping your Jungler etc)."}
{"text": "Against drmundo, Dr Mundo has lots of sustain thanks to his Passive and the items he picks up. Make sure to invest in Executioner\u2019s Calling or another item that inflects grievous wounds to reduce his healing. \n\nIn team fights, Ignite will help reduce his healing, so make sure you Ignite him as soon as he engages. \n\nCrowd control is your best friend against Dr Mundo. If you can layer CC on him in a team fight, it will make it very hard for him to activate his Ultimate R and dish out damage. It will also reduce the healing from his Ultimate R if he activates it if you focus him down and kill him first."}
{"text": "As lux, Level six is a massive power spike as it unlocks Lux's 100 to 0 combo. Any enemy who gets caught out by her g will be in for a world of pain from now on.\n\nHer first item component will allow her to spam her abilities with a higher frequency, deal more damage, and assert lane dominance due to her long-range.\n\nHer early game isn't that luminous because her damage isn't too high because of no items. As the game progresses, she should have a straightforward time dealing with her opponents.        "}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Look for picks on the enemy when they\u2019re out of position. If you can catch out the enemy Support, you can rotate to Baron or Dragon or force a fight with the numbers advantage.\n\nIn the late game, you need to call for Baron or the Elder Dragon. Do not die otherwise your team will not be able to secure them and the enemy will take it for free.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gone in, make sure you fall back and peel for your allies. Use your Ultimate m to lock down key targets and then use your d and e to knock up the enemy on your carries."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Xerath will often go to ward objectives alone. Try to ambush him and catch him out of position. Then use the numbers advantage to take the objective or start a team fight. \n\nDo not let Xerath poke you down before a team fight occurs. Xerath\u2019s goal is to delay a team fight for as long as possible while he pokes with his p and 2. Don\u2019t let him do this by engaging as soon as you can. \n\nXerath will try to stay in the backline- probably behind the ADC. In a team fight, try to flank and take him down at the start. This will make it easier for your team to win the team fight as he would not be able to poke you down."}
{"text": "As missfortune, When playing Yuumi against Miss Fortune, keep in mind your position to avoid being hit by her Q (Double Up). Position yourself behind several minions or out of range to minimize the chances of being hit by her poke ability. At level 6, Miss Fortune's death pressure increases significantly due to the power of her ultimate. Be careful and make sure to play defensively, as it can burst both you and your ADC if you are taken in a favorable position. To create opportunities for your gank jungler, try to keep the minion wave closer to your turret. This forces Miss Fortune to stretch if she wants to harass or farm, making her vulnerable to gonks. Coordinate with your jungler and communicate the wave position to increase the chances of a successful gank. Timing is crucial in the way. Try to reach level 2 at the same time as Miss Fortune to minimize her death pressure. Having access to your abilities allows you to better respond to her aggression and potentially turn the tide in your favor."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie is excellent in team fights thanks to the great AOE on her Ultimate R. When paired with her passive stun, she will be able to stun several champions if they are grouped. She is easy to learn. Many pros, analysts and top ELO players recommend playing Annie if you want to learn the basics of the mid-lane. Annie is really good at bursting and ambushing low-health enemy champions. Getting some murders on Annie can make her Ultimate R incredibly scary."}
{"text": "As brand, Graves is a good early game skirmisher. Make sure you invade and try to fight him and set him behind.\n\nYou are a good counter-ganker. After Brand has gone in, try to counter-gank him as you can easily turn around his ganks.\n\nPlaying around your Ultimate is very important. Look to gank whenever your Ultimate is up.\n\nYour objective control is pretty good. Make sure you solo them as often as possible to get your team ahead."}
{"text": "As ryze, It is therefore very difficult to catch and kill him in a team fight. A great objective control thanks to his Ultimate R. It can allow him to move from a Dragon to a Baron almost immediately. He can also pull back doors with this ability. The CC on his W allows him to put games for himself and his team. This can be really effective if he reaches CC a high priority target, and get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Once Pantheon reaches level 6, communicate with your team every time Pantheon remembers or leaves the track as he can use his Ultimate R to wander and help another way. It's not uncommon for Pantheon to call back and run the bot with his Ultimate R. Take care in the game early that Pantheon will try to skim frequently and go to kill. Keep this in mind and be willing to sacrifice some CS for XP if you're weak in the game early. Avoid trading with Pantheon when his Passive has a lot of batteries because it's going to do a lot of damage in a business. The best time to fight it is when he doesn't have batteries, and a ability on cooldown."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, In the team fights, as soon as Aatrox comes into play, try the CC and bring it down first. He's pretty vulnerable to the CC and if you can kill him before you get his combo, the enemy will lose on a lot of damage. Try looking for fights when Aatrox doesn't have his Ultimate or Flash. He'll have a lot more time to hit the fights when either of them are on cooldown. Aatrox likes to split the thrust after the laning phase has finished. When he shows in a single side track, you could try and start a team fight with his teammates."}
{"text": "As hwei, It will be stronger than you early, but once you have some levels under your belt, you can start to be a little more aggressive. Focus on early farming and limit trading.

But, don\u2019t over-commit to help them especially if you can secure objectives."}
{"text": "As belveth, It can also turn into its true form after killing it and then use this to punish any enemy pursuing. Bel-Veth will be much stronger with every time it remembers, because of how much it benefits from every piece of attack speed that it buys. Once it has finished this first article Mythic, it will be much harder to manage, especially if it gets earlier than expected. The lower the rate of attack means a cooling on its Q, which is its ability to bread and butter, helping its damage, mobility and clear speed. The earlier it gets this speed of attack, the stronger it gets."}
{"text": "As ahri, At level 3, you will have access to all 3 of your basic capabilities. This will allow you to go for favorable exchanges with the enemy. Once you unlock your Ultimate, you can look for spikes on enemy travelers to win an advance. Do not commit, and poke them down with your Q before committing your Ultimate. On your first back, you should have enough gold to buy your first component."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, The brief period of downtime between each Enchantment pick up will be your go-to time to harass her as she will not have a powerful Q that has an empowerment.\n\nBe careful when going for short trades with Qiyana as she prefers them over long extended ones. If you meet her inside the jungle or in the river, do not fight her unless you get the jump onto her or have a clear advantage.\n\nQiyana will look to gank low health lanes or laners with CC. If she cannot find any ganks early, she will power farm till 6 where she gets her R. Then she will actively look to gank when it\u2019s up. Try to get your lanes ahead so she is less likely to pick up free kills"}
{"text": "As zoe, At level 9, her Q will be completely exhausted. Being her main ability to damage, she will now be able to defeat the enemies with ease. Zoe is not too strong at level 11 because he does nothing for her. She will always have to rely on the use of the terrain for her opponents and then blow them up with her Q. Once Zoe reaches level thirteen, she will have increased the potential to pick due to her completely exhausted E. This will make her extremely deadly in the fog of the war."}
{"text": "As amumu, At level 11, Aumu will have 2 points in his Ultimate y. This means that his Ultimate will be there on a shorter cooldown that can help him in team fighting and help his team get choices. The teams start to regroup during the middle of the game, and since Aumu is a team combat champion, he is pretty good during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Don't try to run Wukong if it still has its available place. That's because you can waste your execution on it and it will survive. Keep this in mind during trading too! Wukong wins a lot of automatic attack battles, so don't go for prolonged trades with him unless you can kill him. If Wukong left the track after level 6, tell your team as soon as it leaves. He could try to use his Ultimate n in another way also help his allies."}

If you get poked down, you wont be able to engage and will probably die.\n\nFiora is a strong skirmisher. Look to fight whoever tries to stop you from split pushing. You should be able to fight anyone as long as you\u2019re not behind in the mid-game."}

Your Ultimate R will do a lot of damage in the last game."}
{"text": "As jax, Focus on farming early. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.\n\nHowever, if you do find a ganking or counter-ganking opportunity nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to take it.\n\nIf they invade you early, just back off; you do not win early skirmishes with them.\n\nTry to secure those major objectives when you can, as you have decent objective control. You could gank bot, then take Drake afterwards."}
{"text": "Against zed, As Zed is an Assassin, he will seek to descend targets that walk around the map alone. Avoid crossing the river if it is not monitored. Keep a constant eye on the map and don't put yourself in the same area as Zed if you don't know exactly where it is. Expect Zed to flank and remove squishy targets with his ultimate R. Make sure your flanks are monitored during a goal nap so he can't get the jump on you. During the middle of the game, Zed will often be in a side lane pushed at the slot."}
{"text": "As fiora, Really good duelist and can one vs one anyone if she manages to get a lead early on. Her Passive along with her Q allows her to do a lot of damage to both squishies and tanks alike while allowing her team to do what they want.\n\nHer W is the most important ability in her kit and she can completely negate any form of damage and CC with that ability. The fact that it can block the Ignite tick damage in itself can be tilting for her enemies. When used properly, she can even CC a group of enemy champions by countering any source of enemy CC.\n\nIf she manages to find someone separated from their team, she can one vs one them easily, even if she is behind. This is due to the amount of damage that she can dish out with her Passive and her Ultimate R. Such picks can easily allow her to pressurize and take over a portion of the map."}
{"text": "As ziggs, During the late game, you will mainly function as a mage based on the seat. Focus on taking spins quickly and open the card. This will make you really easy to control the state of the game. Being complete will allow you to explode enemies with ease. All you need to do is combo properly with your W, E, and Ultimate R. This strategy is best used in neutral and objective combats. Use the fog of the war to catch out-of-guard enemies. You can work with your Support and Jungler to set up death brushes for enemies."}

However, she does have a lot of all-in pressure.\n\nHer first major power spike is when she gets her first item.

Her kill pressure will again intensify and she will be able to look for riskier all-ins thanks to the heal that it provides."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 16, Ezreal will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will do a lot of damage to anyone touched with her in the last game. When Ezreal comes to the end of his construction, he will have incredibly low cooling on all his abilities. It's good for him because he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight happens. Moreover, his E will be on a short cooling that allows him to easily escape from the skirmishes. Ezreal is awesome in the middle of the game, but he starts to fall in the last game because it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}
{"text": "As alistar, Keep looking for picks when possible, especially in the side lanes when the enemy carries are trying to catch the waves. Try to sit in the enemy Jungle when possible as it can let you flank the enemy when they push up. You will also be able to catch out the enemy Support while they are warding.\n\nDue to your short Ultimate cooldown, you should try to instigate as many tower dives as you possibly can. Your goal at this point is to all-in the enemy carry/carries, and then move back to your carries while peeling for them. Keep the turret aggro on you if you have to, but drop it once you start getting low.\n\nWith your kit, it should be really easy to secure picks before major neutral fights. Do your best to play around with vision and set death brushes when possible. If you manage to take the enemy Jungler out before a major fight, your t and e should allow you to zone the enemy carries out while your team takes the neutral objective."}
{"text": "Against darius, Darius is one of the best duels in the game, so don't go beyond your welcome. Don't go for prolonged jobs with him as he will always go out ahead.

Darius is relatively motionless and weak when he is attacked by several champions."}

{"text": "As hwei, However, a disadvantage for him to have a lot of abilities is that it can make him quite complicated and overwhelming for the players. He also has a lot of combos in his kit, which makes him quite difficult to master. He is a difficult champion for beginners to learn from. When he is behind, he is not so good. Although he has AOE and a lot of damage, he does nothing in the fights when behind."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, You really don't have to panic unless it succeeds in slowing you down, when you can use a trackbrush and minion to reposition. Make sure you don't let it close peacefully in this matchup, otherwise it will easily regenerate its health and you will be left defenceless in this matchup. Post Six, you can consider ruining other ways when possible. Your chances of getting a murder increase significantly when this happens. Keep the wave somewhere near your turn in this matchup. This will give you many opportunities to bring the enemy under the risk of your Jungler/laners ganks."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Just look to choose enemies with your abilities when possible. It will help make team fighting really unfair for the enemy team. Try to shoot enemies before all-in'ing.

It would be a remarkable ability to use when you see an enemy on a side track."}

He is vulnerable when his t is down, and can be engaged upon if his k movement speed is reduced.\n\nHis Ultimate t can easily be gotten rid of by the enemy by purchasing Control Wards. Enemy Junglers with leaps and dashes can also bypass these mushrooms by taking odd routes.\n\nHe falls off quite drastically during the late game and can only resort to split pushing. This puts his team in a disadvantageous state and causes a lot of tension to build up within the team. "}
{"text": "As katarina, One element is enough to roll her snowball in the game. She just needs to play the initial part of the laning phase correctly, get this element and then go on a murder spree (with the appropriate use of her r and Ultimate R). Even if she is behind on CS, she can easily catch up by wandering around the map and cleaning the killings. She can even do lap dives with her team if the enemy team lacks CC, or if her teammate takes the aggro turret. Her r reset mechanism allows to get several kills in a very short period. Combined with her W, it can allow her to perform multiple trips and escape unpleasant situations."}
{"text": "As vayne, Her first ability will be maximized at level 9. From that moment on, she will start to hit like a truck because her e will be at the top very quickly in the game. The obtaining of two points in her Ultimate n will cause her again at peak. He will help her a lot in the team fights, especially when the enemy team is filled with heavy CC champions. She will have her basic elements now, which means that she will make a respectable amount of damage. She can even duel enemies and will not need her support for the babysitter if she masteres her use."}

{"text": "As illaoi, At level 16, Illaoi will be able to put three points in her Ultimate R. This will make her really strong, and she will quickly turn the tide of a fight with a Ultimate R. Illaoi is really good in the fights because she will do a lot of damage and can easily peel for her allies. She can even get out of enemies who are too close to her, making a complete team fight unfair for the enemy team. Illaoi will have several articles during this stage of this game, and she will be very tanky.

His Q > W > Q combo is already potent. That combined with his p will make him or his ADC nearly uncatchable.\n\nGetting his first item will increase Zilean's poke damage by a considerable margin. He can try to one-shot enemies independently, and his ADC can just focus on farming and going for finishing kills."}
{"text": "As tristana, The slow on her W can allow her to get killed quite easily. She will have to whip her target before that, or she can rely on a gank or her support. Her damaged E tower allows her to buy plates and destroy the towers with ease. This will put her forward in the way, as well as quick lenses if she is left unchecked.

This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}
{"text": "Against lux, Lux will often roam around the map alone to ward. You can ambush her and take her down before a major objective spawns and then quickly take the objective afterwards. \n\nLux excels at catching out enemies with her g. Make sure your team is grouped together and no one is walking around the map alone as she can easily burst them down.\n\nIn team fights, try to engage as soon as possible. Lux will try to delay a team fight so she can poke with her l or get a pick with her g. "}
{"text": "As gwen, When there is no team fight, go into a side track and try to divide the thrust. This way you will continue to win gold and XP that will help you get your next major power peak. Gwen is a strong 1v1 champion- especially if she was able to get an early advance. Watch to apply pressure and fight who in the enemy team is trying to stop you. Continue to play around your Passive and Q in mid-game fights: especially in the 1v1 skirmishes. You will miss on a lot of damage if you don't play around."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Hecarim spikes at level 6 as that allows him to unlock his Ultimate t which is a great duelling tool which will help him win team fights and 1v1\u2019s.\n \nHe is a snowball heavy champion and can easily get ahead just from a kill or two. Try to not feed him or gift him kills as he can quickly snowball out of control.\n \nWhen Hecarim completes Trinity Force, his duelling power intensifies. Avoid 1v1s with him unless you\u2019re ahead. "}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's damage will increase a lot once he has his first element. This will allow his Q and E to hit like a truck during all in. Once Galio reaches level 6, he unlocks the ability to make cross card games around the card. This is advantageous for his team and will allow you to impact the game much more. Since Galio has a limited range, he will have a difficult time early during the game. However, he can use his Q to bypass this. Using his Q, he should try to hit the enemy champion for bonus points."}
{"text": "As orianna, Do not team fight in the later parts of the game unless your Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass and Ultimate d are both up. Delay/ disengage fights if the enemy wants to fight you.\n\nPoke and delay team fights while you and your team harass the enemy and get them low. Once they\u2019re low, engage. You can also look for picks with your abilities to catch someone who is out of position.\n\nStay with your team in the late parts of the game. If you get caught out or the enemy initiates a fight while you\u2019re not there, the enemy will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As leesin, If the enemy team is loaded with heavy CC, be sure to get a defensive element to help you. You should always remember that you hold the Smite for your team. Your goals are to secure choices and peel for your squissy targets during this phase of the game. Your Ultimate k will come in very practical and will allow you to make a lot of games. Securing goals is very important, especially during this phase of the game, as these goals can be the game decision maker. Your e should allow you to make some really fancy games. You should try to get the enemy Jungler out of the pit using your Ultimate k."}
{"text": "As diana, She should try to fight as much as possible during this phase of the game. Her victory condition will be to get out of the Ultimate massive Rs on the enemy team. Throwing them with her Q first and then going for the murder is quite optimal for her. Bonus points if she can do it from the fog of the war. She is powerful when it comes to the enemy backline and should always try to find a flank on the enemy's portages. The best time for all-in them will be when the enemy frontline will decide everything in your team."}
{"text": "As masteryi, When there is no team fight, go on a side track and push. You must continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. The more gold the master Yi has, the stronger he will be. If your team gets one or two killed, call for Baron or the Dragon. You should be able to easily take them as Master Yi. Always use the fog of the war to bamboo the enemy and destroy the enemy backline in this way. It should be really easy to do because of how much damage you can pull out."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan has tons of mobility thanks to his E. He can allow him to move in the way with ease, and go to the enemy to sound quickly. Akshan can bring back his dead allies if he can kill the enemy who killed them. It's great, especially in the last stages of the game where the time of death is long enough. His W allows him to get out of sticky situations and allow him to be camouflaged for a long period of time if he remains close to a wall."}
{"text": "As khazix, Kha'Zix is a very good early game ganker, especially when it involves low or overt enemies. He needs to have access to all his basic capabilities to make sure that the ganks are successful. Hitting level 6 and getting his first power is a significant powerpike for Kha'Zix. He can either melt the goals quickly with his advanced Q or go for a more gank-efficient approach by evolving his E or Ultimate R. The first component will give him a massive increase in damage. This will allow him to take the game relatively quickly if he continues to find dead. During the fighting, he should always go for isolated back linings for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Master Yi needs time to come online. He is really weak in the early lancing phase. His level 6 power peak is quite powerful. If he can go for short trades before hitting level 6, he can easily pursue the enemy down and all-in with his Ultimate R. When Master Yi finished his first component element, he will find much easier to secure CS and win auto-attack trades with the enemy lantern."}
{"text": "Against taric, Avoid putting yourself in choke points to make it harder for Taric to land his E. Stand towards the middle of the lane and away from the walls to give you more room to maneuver and dodge the spell.\n\nIf Taric activates his Ultimate R during a skirmish, you have two options to take. You can either try to blow him up and kill him or his ADC before they get the protection, or you can disengage and wait for it to disappear before fighting again. \n\nLook to harass and poke Taric down as much as you can during the early game. His abilities have high mana costs and he will be unable to spam his Q if you fight often."}
{"text": "As akshan, Ping whenever Akshan goes missing. He is really good at roaming and he could leave lane easily. Make sure you ping whenever he leaves your lane.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave so he cannot push and poke you at the same time with his Q.\n\nAs Akshan is an AD champion, he will win auto-attack trades with you. Don\u2019t trade auto attacks with him as he will always win them.\n\nFocus on farming over fighting. Your goal is to survive the laning phase and gain an XP and gold lead. You can then be stronger in the mid-game, as long as you don\u2019t fall behind."}
{"text": "As gnar, Gnar can deal a lot of damage or be a peeler for his team by tanking a lot of damage. This versatility depends on his form at the time of the fight as well as his build choice.\n\nAt level thirteen, he will have two of his abilities wholly maxed out. That will allow him more frequent usage of his jump and poke abilities which can be highly beneficial during extended fights.\n\nGnar must play around his Ultimate R to ensure that he is vital during the late game. Bonus points if he can use the fog of war to his favor."}
{"text": "As lillia, She will be able to max out her Ultimate R at level 16. This will drastically impact team fights since her Ultimate R will be on a very short cooldown.\n\nLillia is excellent in late-game team fights. This is due to her AoE abilities and mobility, which can let her get a 5-man Ultimate R.\n\nLillia will have multiple items by now. Her damage output and prolonged burn damage will be really obnoxious for the enemy to deal with."}
{"text": "As gragas, Gragas' Ultimate R is very good in team fighting. It deals a lot of damage and can move the entire enemy team. It has good support in the way (compared to many other champions) with its W. This will allow it to look for jobs more frequently and heal after a job. Its E can be used in conjunction with Flash to get surprise jobs/commitments with the enemy. It can also use it to interrupt enemy abilities and dashes."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Try to abuse your range advantage to gain an early health lead.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early on to force them to over extend for farm and XP.\n\nWhen trying to poke, aim your abilities so they hit the minion wave and the enemy at the same time.\n\nOnce they\u2019re level 6 they become stronger than you and it will be harder for you to lane against them."}
{"text": "As irelia, In the late game, continue to split push if your team isn\u2019t at risk of dying or getting caught out.\n\nIf your team is going to get caught out or if the game isn\u2019t one-sided, you need to group with your team to help them fight.\n\nPlay on the side of the map that has the next major objective up so you can rotate to take it with your team. Alternatively, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the map and use it to get to your team."}
{"text": "As qiyana, It will be remarkable at the end of the game. That's because Qiyana can shoot down the enemies easily and take over from the team fights with his Ultimate R. It can also allow him to steal crucial goals. Level 16 is perfect for Qiyana because his Ultimate R will be maximized. It will cut down too much damage for the enemy squishes to manage, and that too often. It will have most of its capabilities maximized during this phase of the game. This means that its release of damage will be massive, and its capabilities will be sooner."}
{"text": "As amumu, Your Ultimate y is an amazing tool that can deal damage and CC the whole enemy team if you\u2019re able to hit them all with it. This makes Amumu an incredibly strong team fighter.\n\nAmumu\u2019s build path is incredibly versatile. Does your team need a tank? You can build tank. Does your team need AP? You can build AP. If you\u2019re ahead, you could go for a full AP build and blow up the enemies.\n\nThanks to having 2 ss, you can look for aggressive plays in the lane and start a snowball. Wait for the enemy to disposition and then go in!"}
{"text": "As rakan, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce has tons of poke damage and can constantly abuse the enemy before starting a fight. Try to delay fighting while you harass the enemy with your s. As Jayce is a varied champion, you can often intimidate the melee champions down and harass them every time they walk to the last blow. Jayce has a lot of utility thanks to his basic abilities."}
{"text": "Against senna, If you're playing as a melee champion, try to minimize your time spent too long during the last strike or get guard-hunting batteries. Wait for Senna to go for an aggressive level 1 game to get batteries. Try not to let her poke take you down too long otherwise you won't be able to trade to level 2 or 3. Once Senna unlocks her Ultimate R, contact your team and tell them that she can impact a fight with her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As diana, At level 9, Diana will max her Q. Her Q offers her a lot of extra wave clear and more poke in lane. She will be a real threat when she hits level 9.\n\nAt level 11, Diana will put the second point in her Ultimate R. It will be on a lower cooldown that allows her to go for more aggressive all-ins. With the lower cooldown comes additional damage. She will deal a lot of burst damage in the mid-game if she is ahead.\n\nAs Diana is an assassin, she will be able to pick off targets in the mid-game that are walking around the map alone. In particular, she can ambush the enemy Support as they try to ward upcoming objectives."}
{"text": "As sylas, Level 16 will see Sylas get a maximum of Ultimate R. The power of its Ultimate R will always depend on the enemy team's comp, but it will be able to use more ultimates in a given time. Its damage will be really significant during this phase of the game. The brilliant damage that it can make completely catch the out-of-guard enemies and ruin their chances of winning the game. Sylas is decent enough during late fighting as it can inflict tons of damage and heal itself for massive amounts at the right time. It will allow him to separate the enemy front line from the rear line and help his team a lot."}
{"text": "As kennen, Quite squishy during the early game and hence can be killed easily. He can either be poked down gradually, which will force him out of the lane, or he can be all-in\u2019d by the enemy laner and the Jungler/Support.\n\nOnce his h is down, he becomes a gank target if he is too pushed up. This will allow his laner to get a free kill on him, especially if his laner manages to use some wave management technique to bait Kennen.\n\nRelies on flanks to get team fight wins so proper vision from the enemy\u2019s side will counter him heavily. This will prevent him from getting into the backline of the enemy team and dealing massive amounts of damage. "}
{"text": "As annie, Your burst damage is almost non-existent when your Ultimate R is down. You will have to play safer and less aggressive while it is on cooldown.\n\nYou are weak against long-ranged poke due. If you cannot get into range of the enemy, you will not be able to play aggressive.\n\nRegardless of the additional movement speed your E offers, Annie has little to no form of escape. If you\u2019re over extended without your E to protect you, you will be an easy target.\n"}
{"text": "Against nami, Nami will walk up to you and use her W on herself (or on you) in attempts to poke and make the wave bounce. Do not stay in range of her so she cannot get health back via the bounce.\n\nWhen you poke Nami, do not walk directly backwards as she can easily Bubble Q you. Instead, try and walk to the side.\n\nLook to trade with Nami when her W is on cooldown as her damage output will plummet."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen will gain a huge peak of power and the finishing ability once he reaches level 6. This will let him go to regular exchanges of short gusts against his enemies, will leave his passive kick after the trade, and then go to the finish with his Ultimate R after having obtained the lower of the enemy. The first element of Garen will allow him either to survive the track for a longer period (tank construction) or to increase his damage significantly (burner construction). The first will allow him to take part in numerous team battles while the second will help him with duels. The construction of Garen will dictate how he plays the game. If he goes for the construction of tanks, he will be almost invalidable and will be able to act as a perfect coat unit for his carryings. On the other hand, if he goes for the construction of blues, he will be more dependent on the fog of the war to catch the enemies out of the guard and choose vital enemy carriers."}
{"text": "As hwei, In the late game, you would\u2019ve completed multiple items and got a lot of levels under your belt. You will be strong in the late game, too.\n\nAt level 16, you\u2019ll put the final point in your R, giving your R a shorter cooldown and increasing your chances of getting picks.\n\nStick with your team in the late game! Hwei is excellent in late-game fights, thanks to his AOE abilities and late-game damage output.\n"}
{"text": "As brand, At level 11, Brand will put a second point in his Ultimate R. Regardless of how ahead or behind he is, his damage output will be substantial in team fights. \n\nAt level 9, Brand would\u2019ve maxed his W ability. This helps him in many ways, including helping him keep the enemy pushed into their tower and as a poking tool to harass the enemy laner.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Brand would\u2019ve completed multiple items. He will also have a lot of additional ability haste or cooldown reduction, allowing him to use his abilities more frequently to harass."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Do not group very closely because it will allow Hecarim to get a multi-person Ultimate T that will help him and his teammates win the fight. Hecarims Ultimate T is about the same width as the paths inside the jungle. Try and avoid fighting in the jungle as it will allow him to get his Ultimate T on all your team. Hecarim can try to flank in team fights so he can get back with his Ultimate T."}
{"text": "As rumble, It is very motionless so make sure that you only overtake when you have pupils placed, and you retreat if the enemy seems to play aggressively. Rumble needs to get a head, and win the way to be useful. It is not so good when behind. It may have little laning power when it plays in a matchup against. In these cases, his best to avoid picking up Rumble."}
{"text": "As anivia, Up to level 6, look to play safely and close as much as you can. Once you have enough gold for Tear, remember that you can start stacking the article. As soon as you touch level 6, use your Ultimate m on the minion wave to keep it pushed into the enemy tower while remaining safe. Keep a constant eye on your mana bar regardless of speed or slow as you push the wave. If you are out of mana, you are not a threat to the enemy."}
{"text": "Against reksai, Rek\u2019Sai is good at picking players off during the mid and late game. Avoid walking around Summoners Rift alone as she might just target you.\n\nCC or burst Rek\u2019Sai down as soon as she engages with her E. This will make it incredibly hard for her to dish out damage or escape after going in.\n\nRek\u2019Sai struggles in 5v5 team fights, so try to force them instead of splitting up and playing alone. If all 5 of your allies are grouped, it\u2019ll make it harder for her to engage safely without dying."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Kayn will try to assassinate targets that are alone during the mid-game. Avoid walking through the river alone if you\u2019re unsure of Kayn\u2019s location.\n\nKayn can tower dive while sieging thanks to his E. Make sure you have your flanks warded so you can spot him before he jumps onto you or your team.\n\nShadow Assassin will look to nuke your backline by flanking or going through walls. Try to peel your backline or set up vision so that you know where he is at all times.\n"}
{"text": "As kassadin, Hit level 2 first and then use your level advantage to gain a significant health lead.\n\nYou\u2019re weaker than them whenever they have their Ultimate up. If you\u2019re at risk of dying, always recall at level 5 so you do not get killed when they hit level 6.\n\nThink twice before using your dash in this matchup. If you dash forward, they could all-in you, or the enemy Jungle could show up. Look at whats happening on the map before dashing forward.\n\nKassadin is very good at roaming. Remember this and ping when they go missing so your other laners know they\u2019re gone."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, If Wukong invades, it's wise to disengage as he holds the upper hand in early duels.\n\nAt level 3, exercise caution when encountering Wukong at a scuttle crab. Unless you possess a clear advantage, it's best to back off to avoid unfavorable engagements.\n\nPrioritize ganking when your ultimate is available, as Wukong is likely to do the same. Capitalize on the opportunities to make an impact on lanes.\n\nExpect Wukong to be active with early ganks. You must maintain a proactive approach by frequently ganking lanes to match his presence.\n"}
{"text": "As zac, You will really be tanky during this phase of the game so make sure you initiate fighting for your team. Let your team know before you all in, however, and keep track of your Passive. Chokepoint fights will be your bread and butter. Your ability to keep the enemy zoned out is next to none, and therefore you should not let them approach objective pits. Always try to separate the enemy backline from the enemy frontline. This will allow your allies to play more freely and keep them safe from the damage inflicted by the enemy backline."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus will have a massive amount of stacks during this phase of the game. This can easily let him one-shot enemy carries who are un-peeled for by the enemy team.\n\nNasus' tankiness will be a force to reckon with as he legit won't die as long as he finds a target to use his Q on. This will provide his team with a reliable front liner.\n\nHis main power spike is during this phase of the game, as he will have multiple items, multiple stacks, and will be able to blatantly all-in and pick enemy champions off at his will."}
{"text": "Against braum, Once Braum hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate r, his kill threat increases dramatically. Keep this in mind and be cautious when trying to harass him.\n \nWhenever Braum\u2019s E is up, trading with him will be much harder. Try and commit to trades while it\u2019s down. If he uses it in a trade, wait for it to end before continuing to fight.\n \nBraum is very good in team fights thanks to his peel and utility. Try and avoid straight 5v5s and instead look for catches or fights where you outnumber the enemy."}
{"text": "As corki, Continue to delay team fights for as long as possible while you harass and poke the enemy down with your b and e.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nThink hard and fast before using your Passive and b towards the enemy team. In particular, do not use it aggressively if your team is not in a position to follow up and go in with you."}
{"text": "As swain, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As nunu, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game.

{"text": "As singed, His tankiness will be really high during this phase of the game due to his items. That combined with his Ultimate n will make him nearly unchaseable and unkillable at the same time.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate n will further bolster his survivability and overall damage dealt in the long run. It will be a massive power spike for him.\n\nHe is excellent during late-game team fights due to his l and Ultimate n. His effectiveness increases if he manages to find a flank on his enemies."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, This champion is an early game bully. Play aggressive throughout the laning phase to get kills. If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate n is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate n is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As masteryi, A fully maxed out Ultimate r will allow Master Yi to mow down the enemy team. This is highly beneficial when it comes to cleaning up late-game fights.\n\nHis damage will be massive during the late game. He can keep on all-in'ing enemies as his Ultimate r will be up quite frequently.\n\nHis team fighting is on another level during this phase of the game.

{"text": "Against lissandra, Lissandra will be using her Q and E to push the wave. Stand outside of the minion wave so she is forced to choose between pushing with her Q or trying to poke you instead.\n\nWhen Lissandra is level 6, you\u2019ll need to play a bit safer as she has increased kill pressure and can set up her Jungler very easily. Make sure you have enough vision around your lane to spot the enemy Jungler before they show up and gank you.\n\nWhen playing as a melee champion, try and stay at max range at all times so it\u2019s harder for Lissandra to CC you with her W. Be careful when walking forward to last hit, and play respectfully if she is zoning you so you don\u2019t take tons of damage."}
{"text": "As sylas, Really good poke and wave clear with his Q. The slow also allows him set ganks for his Jungler and allows him to whittle his laner down.\n\nHis W can allow him to heal a lot of health in dire situations. Being a point and click, it is quite easy to land and can easily change the tide of a fight.\n\nThe initial cast of his E allows him to dash to a certain location. This can allow him to dodge skillshots and also get on an immobile or vulnerable carry."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Cho\u2019Gath is a monster as the game goes on. He can easily eat an unsuspecting squishy target that is roaming through Summoners Rift alone. If you do not know where Cho\u2019Gath is, do not walk through the river isolated or without vision.\n\nCho\u2019Gath\u2019s abilities are crucial when it comes to winning team fight. Do not group too close together so he is unable to land his e on your whole team.\n\nWhen sieging an objective like Baron or Dragon, do not start it if Cho\u2019Gath is alive. With his Ultimate t, he deals more damage than Smite, so it\u2019s best to not take the 50/50."}

Be very careful and let your teammates know about this tactic.\n\nYour Ultimate can make or break the game for your allies. Use it to set up ganks on your laner. This way, your Jungler will prioritize your lane more than any.\n\nKeep the wave close to the tower and focus on getting tankier in this matchup. Failing to do so can easily allow the enemy to all-in you."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Ziggs is really in good team fights because it will allow him to oppose completely with his Q. He can even do it from the fog of the war for a maximum effect. At level 9, the Q of Ziggs will be maximized. This ability has a huge hitbox, and he can easily continue to snooze the enemy out of the way. At level 11, Ziggs will have two points in a Ultimate R. This will give him a massive boost in his overall burst and catch the out-of-guard enemies quite easily. He will also allow him to kill snipe from afar."}

This will be important if you want to survive the laning phase.\n\nAvoid using your Q too often in this matchup unless he is away from the minion wave. It costs a lot of mana and you need the mana for your W!\n\nAn option you can take is to put early points in your E for the additional shield strength."}
{"text": "As sett, It can be trapped to oblivion, especially when it is against a varied portage with a shape or dash or coat. Misuse of its W can cause it to kill because it is its only form of mitigation of damage. It cannot escape easily if someone includes it after using this ability. If the enemy is intelligent, they will avoid regrouping during the fighting. This will prevent Sett from effectively using its Ultimate R, as it was not able to land much damage or slow down several members of the enemy team."}

If he can\u2019t one-shot the person he is targeting, he will be crowd controlled almost immediately and killed on the spot.\n\nIncredibly vulnerable once his Ultimate R is on cooldown. The enemy team should be looking to fight him during this time and target him before anyone else.\n\nIsn\u2019t very effective against a group of champions as he is extremely reliant on picks to get a lead. Besides, crowd controlling him can allow the enemy team to get rid of him quite easily."}

Similarly, Renekton has to play around his Fury bar to get the most damage during a trade. If he fights without Fury or uses the wrong self-sustaining ability, he can cost him the trade. Avoid using your self-sustaining e if possible. Renekton falls into the later stages of the game as he no longer has his early play forces when the game goes further. Moreover, he is really bad in the later stages of the game if he has not got an early lead."}
{"text": "Against reksai, Rek\u2019Sai\u2019s level 3 power spike is incredibly powerful. A laner should always prepare for a Rek\u2019Sai at level 3 as they are very likely to gank one of the lanes.\n\nWhen Rek\u2019Sai hits level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate r, she deals even more damage and can duel the majority of Junglers without a chance of them escaping.\n\nAfter Rek\u2019Sai has completed her jungling item, her kill pressure increases dramatically. At this stage, it will be difficult for you to fight her unless you\u2019re ahead in terms of items and kills."}
{"text": "As renekton, After going in with your Ultimate t, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate t in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate t is up. Fighting with out it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As zac, The first power peak of Xin Zhao in the track is at level 3. It can all-in the enemy at level 3 when it gets access to the 3 basic capabilities. At level 6, Xin Zhao=s kill pressure increases strongly. It can instantly kill any enemy lantern and chase them down once it has its Ultimate R. After Xin took its first component element, it can trade very aggressively with the enemy."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel anyone with your n trying to stop you from pushing into the division. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to take in the vicinity."}
{"text": "As chogath, Play safe in the early game. Cho\u2019Gath needs time to scale and come online. Avoid fighting if possible.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your side of the map early. This will make the laning phase so much safer.\n\nAvoid trading with the enemy if possible. Even though you have good sustain, you can easily die if you try to fight in the first few levels. If the enemy tries to play aggressive, m them and fall back to safety."}
{"text": "As corki, Delay a team fight for as long as possible while you poke and harass the enemy with your b and e. Once the enemy is low, you can commit to the fight.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nAvoid overextending or dying alone. When you\u2019re dead, the enemy may be able to siege an objective, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "As syndra, Level 6 is a massive power spike for Syndra as she can easily burst down enemies now. It also lets her use her E properly.\n\nThe first item component will give her a lot of wave apparent and damage. It will also give her a lot of mana to cast her abilities frequently.\n\nLevel 3 is a decent power spike as it allows her to gain access to all her primary abilities. It also lets her go for regular burst trades against her enemies.        "}
{"text": "As ashe, Due to your range advantage, you should always try to push the wave in when the enemy Jungler is not near your lane. This will allow you to whittle the enemy tower down and possibly take it quickly. Once that is done, immediately swap to the mid-lane as you will be safer there and will be able to get more objectives that way.\n\nBefore major objective fights, use your k to scout around for death brushes set up by the enemy. Besides that, always maintain your range and use your Q and auto-attack slow to constantly kite the enemy team. You don't want to get caught out by any form of CC as it will spell death for you then and there.\n\nIf the enemy carry is highly mobile, you may want to save your Ultimate w until you have a clean shot on them. Getting them CC'd will allow your team to collapse on the said carry while giving you enough time to position well."}
{"text": "As varus, This poke can be really heinous for the enemy team and send them scams. It helps him to cover his weakness due to his immobile nature. He built Grievous Wound in his kit. His E also slows down, which really makes it easier for him to work with the healers and engages the champions of the support. This can be really advantageous in a team fight. His Ultimate R provides utility for his team and can allow him to get key selections that will help him close the game. The projectile moves quickly so that it is easy enough to land as well."}
{"text": "As zac, Try to bait out Zac's E before engaging in a fight, as it is his primary mobility tool and he won't be able to get to you without it.\n\nYour sustain in this matchup is extremely strong, so make sure that you can go for extended trades in this matchup. Failing to do so will severely undermine your ability to get a lead early on.\n\nUse your dash with extreme discretion in this matchup else you will give Zac an easy window to just all-in you. Also, keep the lane brushes warded, as Zac may use it to all-in you out of nowhere.\n\nKeep the wave somewhere close to your tower in this matchup. It will allow you to easily expose Zac to ganks and will completely keep you safe from all-ins. That being said, make sure that he can't shove the wave completely, or you may be tower diven."}
{"text": "As brand, Use your early play force to shoot and harass the enemy with your W as often as you can. Post level 3, you will be able to use your base combo to cut the enemy down. When trading keeps an eye on your mana bar although you will be vulnerable when you are out of mana. At level 6 your pressure to kill increases considerably. Try to play aggressive and look for killed. Make sure the enemy is infected with Blaze so that it deals more damage."}
{"text": "As galio, In addition, it works really well when its target is the one that has to approach the enemies to attack them. At level 9, its Q will be fully maximized. This will give a massive boost to its damage and clear wave. Moreover, it can now help other losers frequently and keep its wave stuffed at all times. It will also be able to pull the enemies from the brushes of the way. Galio will have its basic items at this point. This is beneficial to him, and his team as his overall damage output and survival will be higher."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Nocturne is a great assassin who can spring out on anyone who walks alone around the map. This makes his pick potential incredibly high.\n\nHas a fast and healthy clear. This makes him a Jungler who can hold their own and farm up a storm and get their item and level power spikes relatively fast.\n\nNocturne is easy to learn and doesn't take hundreds of games to learn like some champions in the game."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Once Yasuo reaches level 11, its Ultimate R will have two points in it. This will allow it to inflict more damage and will also allow it to deal with tanks more efficiently than the game continues. At level 9, Yasuo will have maximized its r. It is an excellent peak of power for Yasuo because its damage production increases massively and its tornado r increases considerably. The brushes of the track will help you a lot with that too. Its peak of power mid-game depends on his team comp as well. Yasuo will be able to do much more in the game with ease if the Yasuo team has a form of knockup on one of their champions."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Gangplank's Ultimate R will be a force to reckon with now as it will have multiple upgrades and will give added benefits to him. This will increase his team fighting strength by a lot.\n\nNow he will have three points in his Ultimate R. With the reduced cooldown and the damage, Gangplank will be able to take over the game effortlessly.\n\nThis is the point of the game where Gangplank becomes really scary. He has a truckload of items, his barrels can legitimately one-shot someone, and he can effortlessly chase people down with his Ultimate R. The enemies will have no other option than to walk the plank at this stage."}
{"text": "As sion, Don't play near the lane brushes in this matchup. Sion can easily you CC for a long time and you will get burst. Try to stay mobile in this matchup because Zion's weakness is to deal with moving enemies. Also, CC him at the right time to interrupt his Q. Look for his ultimate in this matchup. If he goes to another way, it's time to push the wave and get some turret plates. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy doesn't have some kind of nap potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}

{"text": "As tristana, She will have many items during the late game, which will allow her to blow squishies up and deal a lot of damage to grouped enemies. It will also let her take more minor damage due to life steal.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow Tristana to take over the game very quickly. The ability will be on a short cooldown which enables her to use it both aggressively and defensively when she wants to.\n\nAll her abilities will be maxed out by now, which means that she will be able to use her W to reposition herself frequently and deal massive amounts of damage to her enemies simultaneously."}
{"text": "As swain, Remember to take as many neutral, objective fights as you possibly can. Your Ultimate R and E will help you massively with it.\n\nSince you will be diving into the enemy team, you will want to get a defensive item like a Zhonya's Hourglass. This will let you use your Ultimate R effectively.\n\nYou will need to take care of your backline and see that they don't get doved and killed.

You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays.\n\nPush the wave and look for roaming opportunities. Lissandra is a very good roaming champion who can impact the map and assist her allies with ease. Post 6, try to push and roam. "}
{"text": "Against malphite, Malphite is at his weakest in the early game. Try to set him behind to delay his next power spike. \n\nAt level 6, Malphite will get his Ultimate h. This is arguable the biggest power spike for him as it allows him to play more aggressive and start ganking his allies.\n\nTeam fights are where Malphite really shines as his Ultimate h is an AOE ability and can knock up multiple people."}
{"text": "Against lulu, In the team fights, try to catch Lulu out of her position or lock her up with CC. If you can get her down first, her ability to protect her ADC and her portages will be diminished. If you can't kill her, you might be able to self-kill her Ultimate R. Lulu will often go to the room alone. You can look at her to ambushe and shoot her while she's isolated and then start a team fight with her team while she's dead. For AD champions, invest in the call of an executor when Lulu and her team are ahead. This will reduce her ability to heal and protect her allies."}
{"text": "Against drmundo, At level 6, Dr. Mundo will seek to trade more often than his Ultimate R provides him with a lot of dual power and maintain. Keep this in mind every time he reaches level 6. Dr. Mundo can get you down to level 1 with his Q. Try to dodge as much as possible so you don't have to blow through an early health pot, or become a target for a level 3 gank. When Dr. Mundo finished Bami-S Cinder, his trading power is much stronger. Don't despise his full potential once he has this product."}
{"text": "Against kaisa, Do not 1v1 Kai\u2019Sa if you\u2019re alone as her Q will focus you. Fighting near minions will be helpful as they will block some of her damage.\n\nExtended trades work in the favour of Kai\u2019Sa thanks to her Passive. Try and keep trades short so she is unable to activate her Passive on you.\n\nWhen recalling, especially when low, make sure you keep an eye on your champion as Kai\u2019Sa may try to finish you off with her W. Do not shop until you\u2019ve successfully recalled to ensure maximum safety."}
{"text": "As talon, Multiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to burst a single enemy down with ease. It will also allow him to escape nasty situations.\n\nTalon will fall off during the later parts of the game as the enemy will build defensive items and be grouped together. He will need to pick his moments and targets carefully.\n\nHe will have a lot of items during this phase of the game. It will allow him to deal a lot of damage if he manages to get on a target. Getting a defensive item will bolster his survivability as well."}
{"text": "Against singed, Singed's Level 1 is strong in the right matchup. Expecting that he will replace the first waves to get an early lead. Once Singed hits Level 6, his death pressure and general boredom increases. Once he activates his Ultimate n, it would be a good idea to disengage and avoid fighting him. Singed is really good in the middle of the game because he can pull a lot of pressure. At this point, he will have a lot of damage and will be super tanky and fast. It will be difficult for you to kill him alone."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve hit level 6, request assistance from your Jungler to kill the enemy laner.

{"text": "As lux, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As varus, As you get your items, you should have a really easy time blowing enemies up with ease. Set some deep wards to facilitate long-ranged Qs on the enemy team.\n\nYour E and W will be really beneficial during actual fights as the Grievous Wounds and the slow should disrupt the enemy heavily. This will make your team win fights easily.\n\nA defensive item may help you a lot in this matchup, especially if you are going for an AP build. Just make sure that you don't stay too far away from your allies."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah will want to delay a team fight for as long as possible while she pokes you down with her Q. Try and force a fight as soon as you spot her.\n\nAvoid splitting up and playing alone. Taliyah\u2019s Ultimate R will allow her to pick off enemies who are alone or isolated without assistance. Do not push up too far forward if you have no one nearby.\n\nTaliyah has good pick potential with her C. If you don\u2019t know where Taliyah is in the mid-game, do not walk around Summoners Rift alone and avoid areas without vision as she may be looking to set up a surprise attack."}
{"text": "As aatrox, The first major peak of Aatrox is at level 3 when it has access to all its basic skills. This will allow it to go to favorable trades. Once Aatrox has obtained its first component element, it will be able to go to favorable trades. Look to play more aggressive once you get your first component element. When Aatrox has obtained its Ultimate, its death pressure increases considerably."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Level 6 is a massive peak and should allow it to dominate battles and duels in the jungle. It can actually a-shot any squishy enemy who wanders as well without a goal. The first element will allow it to do a lot of damage, and its trading will be highly optimized. It will need to maintain health whenever possible so that it can all enemies and run the ganks properly."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss on the CC it provides.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Try and space accordingly to Veigar in team fights. Do not position too far forward as it will allow Veigar to catch you out with his n and start a team fight.\n\nLocking Veigar down with CC will be the best way to deal with him in team fights. He is pretty squishy so if you\u2019re able to get on to him and take him down at the start of the fight, your team will have an easier time winning it.\n\nVeigar will use his Ultimate R to try and take down a low health/defenceless enemy. Buy items that will make it less likely that he can one-shot you with his Ultimate R. Standing as far back as possible will also reduce his chances of using it on you."}
{"text": "As lillia, As Lillia is usually built AP, she will struggle against teams that have high burst damage. She also struggles against poke and disengage, which can make team fighting difficult for her.\n\nWhile her Ultimate R is a great team fighting tool, it does take some time to come into effect. Your allies can also disrupt your damage if they deal damage to a sleepy target.\n\nShe will struggle to lane into matchups and champions that are strong early and have a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As taric, In the team fights, continue to focus on the most squishiest and easiest targets to kill in the backline. Your Ultimate R will help you a lot with that. In the late part, look for shots on immobile or poorly positioned enemies. Taking someone in the late part can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the baron or older dragon. Protect your allies with your life in this game. Make sure you use your Ultimate R at the right time or it can very well cost you the game."}
{"text": "As ornn, Ornn is quite vulnerable in the early game and can be abused heavily if he is against an early game dominant laner or a ranged enemy champion.\n\nIf you get CC\u2019d or miss your Ultimate R timing, you will be unable to knock up the enemy. Missing out on an ability like this can be devastating in late game team fights.\n\nHe is weak if his allies are behind. Regardless of how well he is doing, he needs his team to be able to survive and deal follow up damage on enemies he has caught out of position."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao is incredibly strong during the early game thanks to his E and Q. He will win most all-ins as long as he looks for favourable trades around abilities.\n\nHis Ultimate R is very effective against ranged members of the enemy team. This will force the enemy carries to come in melee range of him, which can be quite devastating for them.\n\nHas great all-in potential. If the enemy oversteps, he can close the gap and all-in them and take them down."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, Stick with your team and look for picks with your E. Avoid walking or moving around Summoners Rift alone.\n\nUse your Ultimate in the late game as a utility tool to keep your allies safe and to prevent the enemy from getting on to your teammates.\n\nTry your hardest to kite and move around in team fights. It\u2019s important that you stay alive for as long to dish out damage with your Q."}
{"text": "As shaco, It can be strong against the all-in champions, but weak against the range champions. It reaches level 6 as it can use its clone l to inflict tons of additional damage to the enemy. Moreover, it is an excellent tool for juke damage and save its life. Its first peak at the beginning of the game is when it recalled and picked up its first component. Its production of damage and its trading potential will increase considerably."}
{"text": "As neeko, Level six is a significant spike for Neeko as she gains access to her power Ultimate R. Team fighting will become really easy now.\n\nHer early game is pretty decent as she can poke the enemies out from range. Her E will be empowered if she can manipulate the minion wave properly.\n\nThe first component will allow her to spam abilities and not run out of mana. It will also let her deal a lot of damage in the lane."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Its level eleven is not too good because it does not give it much statistics. The Ultimate e in itself will be convenient, however, and Trendamere can use track brushes to catch the enemy by surprise. Trendamere is really good at the split thrust due to its kit. It allows it to 1 v 1 targets with ease while making sure that it can escape in time if the enemy team decides to collapse on it. It can roughly duel any enemy during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Level 6 is a decent powerpike because Seraphine will get her Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is piled together or standing in a line. The first element increases its damage and allows it to use its abilities a little more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will have to pay attention to spamming spells."}
{"text": "As sion, It is quite weak before touching level six. That's because it doesn't have much mobility, and enemies can easily get away from it if they have a vision of it. After six, Zion gets a decent peak of power as it gets a team struggle impacting Ultimate R. It allows it to ride around and the gangway other tracks as well. The first element will give a boost to its survival and overall damage. It will be able to use its Q from brushes to enemies CC and then follow it with damage to the rest of its abilities."}
{"text": "Against sett, When playing as a ranged mid-laner, try your hardest to harass and poke him down while staying at the maximum distance as possible so he is unable to E you.\n\nAvoid extended trades with Sett early. He has a lot of physical damage and will win most auto-attack trades. Keep this in mind when trading with him.\n\nAt level 6, Sett\u2019s Ultimate R is pretty strong. Do not overextend or stay on low health in the lane as he can easily kill you or set up his Jungler."}
{"text": "As akshan, During the average game, make sure you are not ADC'ing regularly. Clean up kills when possible, but don't get too close to the other heavy CC champions, you will definitely get killed. Use your E carefully in this phase of the game. The goal is to make sure that you are never taken out of sight by a skill shot that has the potential of CC you. Your W will come in very practical during this phase of the game. Stay in the backline and keep hitting the enemies until your team all-in. Once the battle is over, go for cleaning kills."}
{"text": "As leblanc, After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done."}
{"text": "As vladimir, A maxed-out Ultimate e will hurt the enemy team massively. Any fight around chokepoints will allow Vladimir to win the fight immediately due to his sustain and damage.\n\nMultiple items will let him deal more damage to enemies, especially those who clump up together during team fights. He should be relatively safe as well and will heal from a ton of damage.\n\nHis life steal and damage during the late game will make him really good in team fights. He will just need to use his l and Q at the proper times, and he will be unkillable."}
{"text": "As maokai, Very weak during the early game and can easily be killed, especially if the enemy he is facing happens to be ranged in nature.\n\nGrievous Wounds are a must buy against him during the early game. It prevents him from healing a lot, especially when he uses his W, Q engage on a target.\n\nProper vision control from the enemy team will remove any form of flanking opportunity which Maokai can exploit in order to initiate an all-in. This will reduce Maokai\u2019s effectiveness. "}
{"text": "As xayah, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle track and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in his Ultimate R. As long as he can get the channel off, he will be very good in the late game.\n\nTeams will continue to group in the late game. This will allow Fiddlesticks to get a lovely amount of damage down to the whole enemy team.\n\nWhile you\u2019re good in the late game, you\u2019re incredibly squishy. Lookout and be cautious when trying to get a good Ultimate R off so you don\u2019t get killed before a fight breaks out."}

His positioning matters in team fights as well, otherwise, he can get flanked by enemy assassins and get instantly deleted.\n\nWithout his Ultimate c or s, his ability to dominate a team fight drastically decreases. Fighting him during this stage will give the enemy team a much greater chance of winning.\n\nPractically gets countered by a Control Ward as it forces him to reroute. This is because of the short-ranged nature of his auto-attacks, which makes him get detected quite easily."}
{"text": "Against akali, Akali has a powerful early game with her Q and Passive. She will look to harass you whenever you go for CS.

Use this to your advantage to trade with her early on and harassing her whenever she goes for CS. A good time to trade with her is when she has used/missed her Q.\n \nAkali\u2019s W is important for trading and her survivability, but it has a long cooldown. Trade and harass her whenever it's down."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Once Quinn hits level 6, her kill pressure in a trade doesn\u2019t exactly increase as her Ultimate R is a utility tool. However, her ability to roam does. If she leaves the lane, ping your teammates so they know that she is missing.\n\nShe has a lot of burst damage early. Keep this in mind when laning against her and expect her to play aggressive and look for all-ins.\n\nWhen returning to the lane, Quinn may look for an aggressive all-in. This is another thing to keep in mind. You can reduce her chances of all-ining you by watching as you walk back to lane, or by keeping the wave closer to your side of the lane."}
{"text": "Against khazix, Kha\u2019Zix will be looking to gank a lot in the early game to get ahead. Try to equal his kill pressure early on by counter ganking if you\u2019re nearby.\n\nHe can solo objectives like the Dragon or Rift Herald with ease thanks to his Q. Make sure you keep these objectives warded so you can spot him if he tries to take them. \n\nWhen fighting Kha\u2019Zix, unless you have the lead, avoid fighting him when there are no minions or jungle camps nearby. Thanks to his Passive, he will deal more damage to you if you\u2019re isolated with no-one around."}
{"text": "Against nocturne, Nocturne will rather play in safety early because he lacks real damage until he gets his first article. Try to bring him down and force him to come back early so he lacks on the gold and the experience. His level 6 is very strong. If he is unable to kill you, he will seek to wander and use his Ultimate elsewhere. If he activates his Ultimate has and it is not Ulting to you, push the wave as quickly as you can and take Tower plates. When he plays like a varied AP champion, try to keep your distance as far as possible. If you allow him to climb on you, it will be difficult for you to get him out of there. Never try to exchange cars with him once he is on you or he will always come out of the business you blow to blow."}
{"text": "As gwen, In the late game, stay with your team. Avoid getting too far away from them because the enemy can force a fight while you're gone. Focus the closest enemy champion in the team fights. Even with your W, you're always squishy and vulnerable to the enemy rear line. Focus the same champion as your allies focus. You can cut down a ton of damage in late game team fights with your Q-related damage. Make sure you're self-attacking as much as you can to increase your Q-related damage."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo becomes really powerful once he hits level 16. This means that his Ultimate R will deal massive amounts of damage in a brief period. Moreso, the short cooldown will allow Yasuo to deal with tanks regularly.\n\nYasuo will have a bunch of completed items during this phase of the game. This means that Yasuo will decimate the enemy due to his Passive and r damage. He can pretty much one-shot squishies with ease.\n\nDue to all his completed items, and his ability to quickly dash around and pierce through the tanks' armors, Yasuo will be able to deal a plethora of damage in a short time. The enemy team might as well FF at this point if Yasuo manages to get ahead."}

A maxed out Ultimate n will give Vayne a massive power peak. This is absolutely necessary to win the game and will allow Vayne to deposit tons of damage. Vayne will now have several items, which means she will hit enemies like a truck. A defensive element should allow her to solidify her position as the main port of the team."}
{"text": "As ivern, Focus on farming and ganking as often as possible. This will help you get ahead and help you get your allies ahead too.\n\nWatch the Supports early itemisation and be prepared to adjust your items. There\u2019s no point buying the same items.\n\nOne of Iverns early strengths is that he can steal away camps. If you know where the enemy Jungler is and one of their camps is about to spawn, you should try to steal it."}
{"text": "As rumble, He is very immobile so make sure you only over-extend when you have wards placed, and you back off if the enemy looks to be playing aggressively.\n\nRumble needs to get a head, and win lane to be useful. He isn\u2019t that good when behind.\n\nHe can have little laning power when he is playing in a countered matchup. In these cases, its best to avoid picking Rumble.\n"}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Your goal is to hide in the fog of the war during the team fights and then get a massive CC from the enemy team. Fighting around the bottlenecks should be very fruitful for you. Roll around when possible as your Ultimate R, E, and Q should compensate for some easy ganks during this phase of the game. Work with your Jungler to invade the enemy Jungle and secure the peaks. Work with your Jungler and set up death brushes whenever you can. This will help you a lot in this game because your Active Q is really too powerful in case of people bursting."}
{"text": "Against trundle, Trundle is strong in the very early game in the Support role. Expect him to go for early plays to get ahead.\n\nAt level 6, Trundle will be a lot stronger thanks to his Ultimate n. It will buff him up and make him much harder to handle.\n\nOnce he has purchased boots, Trundle\u2019s roaming potential and overall map pressure increase. He may look for plays around the map to get his team ahead."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas manages to get to level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate R. This means that he can initiate fights and displace key enemy targets way more frequently.\n\nAt level nine, Gragas will have his first ability maxed out. This is really beneficial for him as the damage increase will really help him duel. This is especially true if Gragas is going for the full AP build.\n\nDuring the mid-game, the enemy will be busy swapping lanes and setting vision. As a Jungler, Gragas can easily use his Ultimate R to pick such enemies out before significant fights."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong\u2019s level 3 is quite strong. Once he has all his basic abilities, he can look for a favourable trade. \n\nOnce Wukong hit\u2019s level 6, his kill pressure increases dramatically. Expect him to look for kills once his Ultimate n is up.\n\nWukong is strong in mid-game team fights thanks to the AOE knockup on his Ultimate n. Expect him to look for fights by attacking from the side. "}
{"text": "As rengar, Rengar is quite weak until he succeeds in reaching level six. He will have to keep track of the enemy Jungler and use Jungle brushes accordingly to win the early match. The first element will allow him to deal with a lot of damage and help him with his compensations. He will also be beneficial in trying to go for all-in combos. Rengar's objective control is phenomenal. Hee can easily gank a way, get murders or force them to step back, and then take the goal."}
{"text": "As renata, At level 16, Renata will put the final point in her Ultimate R. The Ultimates cooldown will be slightly lower which could enable her team to win the fight by picking off a key target.\n\nShe would\u2019ve completed multiple items at this stage of the game. Her peel potential heavily increases and so does her team fighting skill.\n\nTeams will be grouped in the late game, and as her Ultimate is a great tool for team fights, she will be very strong in the late game.\n"}
{"text": "As swain, Bait out his E before trying to engage if possible. His level 6 power point is stronger, giving him additional survival against all-in. So, you have to keep this in mind during the fight against him. Get healing reduction elements to mitigate his continued fighting."}
{"text": "As masteryi, He will focus mainly on cleaning during the start of the game. His e can easily be interrupted by any form of hard CC. This can make the lap divers risky and can get him killed almost instantly if he does not use the ability properly. Can't do a lot if the enemy team has just disengaged when his Ultimate R is active. Very sensitive to the CC, so if the enemy saves their CC for him, he will die."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Focus on agriculture and hit level 6 as fast as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your waste potential. Your ultimate t is an incredibly strong tool. Every time it's up, try to use it to help your allies and get murders. Try to secure goals with your team."}
{"text": "As anivia, During the middle of the game, Anivia should have her Tear fully stacked. This will be very useful for her as it will prevent her from missing mana by using her Ultimate m. Anivia is good in the team fights, and the middle of the game is usually when the teams start to regroup. This makes her a good mid-game champion. Thanks to Anivias support and her Ultimate m, she has good control over the goals like the Baron or the Dragon."}
{"text": "As lulu, Avoid detaching from your ally if Lulu's W (Whimsy) ability is available, as she can polymorph you and disrupt your movements.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your side of the lane to create opportunities for jungle ganks and increase your safety.\n\nAfter level 6, it becomes more challenging to secure kills on Lulu or her ADC due to her ultimate (Wild Growth) providing additional health and a knock-up effect. Take this into account when engaging.\n\nDuring levels 1 and 2, focus on poking Lulu as much as possible with your basic attacks to pressure her and potentially gain an advantage."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Do not push the lane without having the lane bushes warded in the bottom lane. You never know, Fiddle could be hiding in there and ready to pounce.\n\nFiddlesticks is rather immobile and generally pushes the wave. Try to request ganks from your Jungler and then go in just before they arrive for the maximum chance of killing him.\n\nTry and bait out his Q before fully committing to an engage otherwise he will interrupt the exchange. One way you can do this is by walking forward and falsely baiting an engage. Whenever he uses his Q, abuse the cooldown."}
{"text": "As volibear, A low Ultimate R cooldown means that he can team fight frequently. It will also boost his overall pick potential, making team fights unfair for the enemy team.\n\nVolibear is really tanky during the later parts of the game. It becomes tough to take him down, even with Grievous Wounds.\n\nVolibear starts falling off during the late game. He will now function as a reliable front-liner than an actual duelist to protect his carries."}
{"text": "As sett, Level one and two are decent power spikes as Sett can use his E and W to initiate multiple all-ins. Combine this with his Flash, and Sett can easily cheese enemies once he hits level 2.\n\nLevel 6 is another significant power spike, especially if the enemy happens to have a tank Support in their ranks. He can easily Ultimate R them back into their team, dealing a lot of damage to them together.\n\nBoots are a significant power spike as he can now roam around easily and stick to enemies with ease. It will also allow him to get to Jungle skirmishes faster than anyone else."}
{"text": "As senna, Senna's early game is quite lovely. She can heal for a decent amount, and the damage is pretty substantial as well. She will need to care about her positioning, though.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent powerspike as Senna will get her Ultimate R and can help allies all over the map. She can also get finishing kills with the ability.\n\nThe first item component increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a bit more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will need to be careful about spamming spells.        "}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Try to team fight in the open so he is unable to use his empowered E to stun your whole team. Do not fight inside the jungle as the size of his E is roughly the same as the jungle.\n\nOnce Heimerdinger hits level 6, he technically unlocks 3 new abilities. Be careful when trying to initiate a skirmish with him as he might just pull out his magic card and kill you.\n\nJust like during the laning phase, you\u2019ll want to destroy Heimerdingers Turrets Q as quickly as you can before a team fight is underway so he is unable to dish out tons of damage."}
{"text": "As sylas, His W can allow him to heal a lot of health in terrible situations. Being a point and a click, it is quite easy to land and can easily change the tide of a fight. The initial casting of his E allows him to move to a certain place. This can allow him to avoid hot skills and also to get on a still or vulnerable port."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, You can use the digital advantage to force goals or look for favorable fights to win an advantage. If Tryndamere is divided by pushing into the bottom of the game, avoid sending a lot of people to stop him when Baron. It will take you some time to kill him even if you hire 5 champions to kill him who could give his team a lot of time to take the Baron. Try to fight when Tryndamere doesn't have his Ultimate e}up. It will make it incredibly hard for him to straighten out a lot of damage in a team fight."}
{"text": "As kayle, Kayle is weak early, so she will have to depend on her Q for most of her poke and agriculture in the way. This is the phase that must be played very carefully by Kayle. Her level six is a massive peak of power due to her varied automatic attacks. This will allow her to play more liberally and let her play the way more safely. Kayle's first article will help her a lot in trade and agriculture. This is really useful for her and will help her scale quickly from now on."}
{"text": "As malzahar, It will counter your all-in at level 6, so be careful and consider roaming instead. Stay away from the minions to prevent Malzahar E from spreading to you and causing additional damage. Take care of varied poke and be prepared to sacrifice CS for better health preservation in the early laning phase."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Level 11 allows Kog'Maw to inflict a lot of poke damage on enemies. The wide range also allows him to take ill-healthed enemies recalling at a distance. It will be perfect during the middle of the game, provided it does not collapse and does not stop. CC is his worst enemy, and Kog'Maw will have to keep an eye on his flanks at all times."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, After six, it can select any target and convert the fight into a 1 v 1. This can mean hell for any still enemy or weak health carry that Mordekaiser can easily E>Q them. Once it gets enough items, it will be almost invalid unless the enemy team concentrates it down. In a team fight, its E can be extremely beneficial in the fight against the opposing teams."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Nocturne falls into the late part because he cannot shoot enemies because of defensive objects. He will have to choose the enemies carefully. The last point in his Ultimate a will be the ultimate nail in the coffin of the enemy team, especially if Nocturne is in advance. His damage is relatively significant during the late part, but an enemy fired will also be difficult for him. In return, it will be difficult for the enemy to kill him quickly too."}
{"text": "As hwei, Stay with your team in the late game so you are not taken out of position and die due to low mobility. Look for choices with your allies. Don't be afraid to use your R to get choices with them. You also have CC tools, so don't be afraid to try to make games as long as your allies can follow. You're good at fighting around the goals, so try to make games with your R around these major goals in the late game."}
{"text": "As ekko, Find a healthy balance between ganking lanes, getting picks with your W, securing objectives and farming your own jungle.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "As ashe, You are extremely strong during the laning phase because of your long-range poke and self-attacks. This allows you to get rid of your enemy's health bar. The amount of utility you bring to a team comp is massive. Your self-attack slows down and your Ultimate w can easily help your team secure choices before spawning important goal. Once you get some items, your Ultimate *R* will be on a considerably less cooldown. This can help your team secure more choices"}
{"text": "As lissandra, Avoid team fighting at the end of the game unless your Ultimate R and Zhonyas Hourglass are in place. If you try to fight as a team when one of them is down, you will be rather vulnerable. Use your capabilities at the end of the game to peel your aircraft carriers to keep them alive. Use your Ultimate R on the nearest enemy champion and focus them first. Stay with your team at all times. Don't leave them and go to split thrust as the enemy can force a fight while you're gone. Stay grouped, but be ready to stay on the side and out of sight."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Miss Fortune can melt enemies health bars with her t. This can often give her a huge early game advantage.\n\nHer Ultimate e is very strong in team fights. Getting one good Ultimate e off could result in your team winning the game. It\u2019s just important that you cast it from a safe place and out of immediate danger.\n\nHas lots of poke in lane with her t and t. This can give her a lot of pressure in the lane itself and let her bully the enemy down with ease."}
{"text": "Against blitzcrank, Blitzcrank may try to steal or delay your Junglers first buff. A ward in the river at 1:25 is a good way of knowing if he\u2019s going to Hook b it or not. If he shows on the ward, make sure the monster is pulled outwards so he cannot easily land his Hook b.\n\nNever use your dash or dodge ability unless Blitzcrank has his b on cooldown. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to be an easy target for his Hook b and it will be harder for you to dodge it.\n\nIf you\u2019re a squishy champion or you\u2019re without Flash or a dash, do not put yourself in unnecessary danger. Avoid pushing,  playing too far forward or playing overly aggressive when Blitzcrank\u2019s b is up."}
{"text": "Against kalista, Kalista is vulnerable to slow down and to the CC. Try to lock her up at the beginning of the fight so she can't dry up a lot of damage. Kalista can stay in a side lane to divide the thrust. When she's not with her team, you can force a team struggle or take a goal. If you don't know where Kalista and her Jungler are, they could try to sneak in the baron or the Dragon. Make sure you kept it at any time as she can easily take it thanks to her r."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Morgana is a good start to Jungler game. Expect it to go for frequent ganks. It can start to crash after level 3. Morgana level 6 power peak is pretty powerful as it can lock you for a long period of time with its Q and Ultimate R. After Morg has finished its first element, its damage output will be extremely high."}
{"text": "As karma, Poke the enemy as much as possible with your Q to lower them. Use your early lane dominance to gain a health advantage on the enemy. Watch your positioning at all times. Karma is super squishy and will easily die if it walks too far forward. Make sure to place the vision around your track to keep you and your ADC safe. Staying alive is the key to winning in the later parts of the game."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Play safe in the early game. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you will struggle to lane and you will delay your first major power spike. \n\nFocus on power farming and minimizing trading until you\u2019re level 6. Once you unlock your Ultimate k, you can start to be more aggressive.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, you can look to play more aggressive as you can use your Ultimate k as a trading tool and something to fall back on."}
{"text": "As volibear, Make sure that you go for short burst trades against Volibear when possible. This will keep him at bay, but make sure you trade after his E is down.\n\nFocus on getting your first item component quickly. This will help you get an edge in the lane, especially once you get some Grievous Wounds.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate, you should become more aggressive in this matchup. The point is to take him down frequently so that he can't do much in the lane.\n\nThe wave is to be kept on your side of the tower to have a safe adobe from ganks. This will help you scale up till you can actually deal some damage."}
{"text": "As akali, At level 16, Akali will have 3 points in her Ultimate She will be able to dish out a lot of damage to anyone she comes into contact with. Your Ultimate will also be on a lower cooldown, which is very beneficial.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Akali would be near max build. Landing an E on a squishy enemy champion should result in an easy kill. This kill could result in either the Baron or a favourable forced 5v4 fight.\n\nAkali does fall off in the later parts of the game as teams start to group. Akali is at her strongest in split fights or picks rather than straight 5v5s. Also, the enemy should start buying defensive items, which will make it harder for her to take them down."}
{"text": "As vex, Vex has a shield on her W that can protect her from incoming damage.\n\nReally good wave clear with her Q and E.\n\nGreat pick potential with her Ultimate R which can also be used to help her roam to other lanes."}
{"text": "As ahri, At level 3, you will have access to all 3 of your basic abilities. This will allow you to go for favourable trades with the enemy.\n\nOnce you unlock your Ultimate, you can look for picks on the enemy laners to gain a lead. Do not over commit, and poke them down with your Q before committing your Ultimate.\n\nOn your first back, you should have enough gold to buy your first component item. Once you\u2019ve picked up this item, your damage output will increase heavily."}
{"text": "As kindred, If Kindred has more than 8 piles at this stage, she'll just crush everyone and go through the destruction of the Nexus soon. She'll just need to keep an eye on her positioning. At level 16, her Ultimate R will be maximized. This means that she can use it more frequently, allowing her to turn the tide of important team fighting and objective fighting. Kindred will now have several articles, which allows her to do a lot of damage. Combined with the number of brands she has, this damage will be the decisive factor of victory in the game."}
{"text": "Against garen, Deny Garen\u2019s Passive by auto-attacking him whenever possible. This will reduce his sustain in lane and make killing him easier.\n \nGaren\u2019s E deals extra damage to lone targets. You can mitigate the damage by fighting beside your minions. They will also start focusing him if he auto-attacks you.\n \nTry and stay at max distance at all times against Garen. This will reduce his all-in potential. Additionally, by standing at the maximum distance possible, he will have to waste his Q to get in range of you to trade. You can capitalise on this and look to trade with him while it\u2019s on cooldown."}
{"text": "As camille, In the first levels, play safely and avoid trading. Camille is very early game damage is quite weak, so you're probably going to lose a trade vs an aggressive laner. Once you're level 4, you can look to fight and punish the enemy. Play around enemy abilities to facilitate trading. Try your toughest to get killed with your Ultimate R. You can do it by asking for ganks or looking to wander and help the Mid laner. Just make sure you push the wave before leaving the track."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Having 3 points in his Ultimate R is another significant power spike for Vel'Koz. This will allow him to melt through everyone like a hot butter knife. His burst damage will be immaculate as well.\n\nVel'Koz is good in team fights during this game due to his Passive and Ultimate R. That, in combination with the rest of his abilities, make up for some obnoxious poke damage.\n\nHaving his complete build will allow Vel'Koz to burst people down like balloons. Any squishy who gets caught in the crossfire will definitely end up dying."}
{"text": "As warwick, Has great support in the way thanks to his Q and the elements he will collect throughout the laning phase. Good potential to pick throughout the game with his Ultimate R. Even if he can't use it at the top, he can use it elsewhere. Good split pusher and good at chasing enemies in the middle and at the end of the game."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. The more gold Master Yi has, the stronger he will be.\n\nIf your team gets a kill or two, make the call for Baron or the Dragon. You should be able to take them with ease as Master Yi."}
{"text": "As reksai, This champion has a clear health that you can use your W, get buried and get some health back as you move from camp to camp. Rek-Sai is incredibly mobile that allows him to escape sticky situations with ease thanks to his E."}
{"text": "As ekko, The enemy will not waste much in the early game, so try your hardest to get as many ganks as possible. Getting your allies forward will only cause the enemy to fall behind and make their Jungler useless. Priorize taking the Dragons early. You can solo the Dragon with ease, or you can ask for help and turn to it after helping the robot. Make sure that you make sure all Dragons when possible to refuse them from the enemy. At level 6 is when the enemy will probably start to gaunt. You can follow them with a good vision through the neighborhoods placed in and around the river. If you are nearby, try to counter gank as they have nothing to offer once they have used their abilities that you can capitalize on. If you are not nearby, start the Dragon or try to gank another way. While the enemy Jungler will not be gant, fighting them alone will be difficult as they have tools to escape or prevent the fight."}
{"text": "As swain, Excellent CC chain if he or someone else on his team manages to CC a target. This works especially well against immobile carries. You can follow up with your E (press it twice) and pull the enemy closer.\n\nCan regenerate a lot of health with his W and hence outsustain his enemies in the lane. His Ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective when fighting in closed spaces.\n\nHe can use his W to set-up ganks for his Jungler as well. This allows him to catch up to his target while also providing vision of the area. The latter part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "Against taric, Taric will look for pieces of cheesey in your jungle to get killed. Watch that you walk in your own jungle so it doesn't come down quickly. It can start to gantry very early. Make sure you place quarters around the map to spot it before he can get his allies before. Take the Dragons as often as you can! He can't easily take them alone, so if you can take them before him, you'll help your team a lot."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Try and space Veigar accordingly in the team fights. Do not position too far forward that it will allow Veigar to catch you with his n and start a team fight. Locking Veigar down with CC will be the best way to deal with him in the team fights. He is pretty squishy so if you are able to mount him and shoot him at the beginning of the fight, your team will have a easier time to win. Veigar will use his Ultimate R to try to bring down a weak / defenseless enemy. Buying items that will make you less likely to a-shot with his Ultimate R. Standing as far away as possible will also reduce his chances of using it on you."}
{"text": "As morgana, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nLook for picks during the mid-game. If you can pick someone off with the help from your allies, you can abuse their death timer to earn more gold and possibly take a tower, an objective or get more kills."}
{"text": "As neeko, Mid-game is a decent time to roam around and get picks all around the map. Your W and Passive should let you get easy choices on enemies who are too pushed up in the lane.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be pivotal to team fights. Just make sure that you use your Passive to hide yourself and your Ultimate R windup time.\n\nPicking enemies off will be the name of the game during this phase. Work with your Jungler and see if you can blow up some wandering Jungler or Support from the enemy team.        "}
{"text": "Against aatrox, In the team fights, as soon as Aatrox comes into play, try the CC and bring it down first. He's pretty vulnerable to the CC and if you can kill him before you get his combo, the enemy will lose on a lot of damage. Try looking for fights when Aatrox doesn't have his Ultimate or Flash. He'll have a lot more time to hit the fights when either of them are on cooldown. Aatrox likes to split the thrust after the laning phase has finished. When he shows in a single side track, you could try and start a team fight with his teammates."}
{"text": "As nunu, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late-game team fights.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting without it will make the late-game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone."}
{"text": "As lissandra, The teams tend to regroup during the end of the game. This means that Lissandra will have a gala to find choices and CC'ing the entire enemy team. Her Ultimate R will become really powerful when it is maximized. This means that she will be able to take enemies with ease and whenever she wants. This is really beneficial to her team. Lissandra will have several articles during this phase of the game. This means that she will make huge amounts of AoE damage that will harm the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against syndra, Watch your flanks and avoid walking through unwarded territory as Syndra has great setup with her Q and E combo. \n\nDo not let Syndra poke you down before a team fight occurs. Her goal will be to harass as much as she can before looking for a pick. Engage as quickly as you can so she is unable to poke you down.\n\nAvoid fighting inside the jungle or around an objective as it will make landing her E and getting a multiperson stun easier. Fight in the open when possible and avoid grouping too closely."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Keep poking enemies with your e and try to target the minion wave with it for maximal effectiveness. Do not do anything which involves you pushing into the enemy territory.\n\nIf the enemy is extending too far, just use your e to get some damage off on them. However, back off a bit as sudden aggression from the enemy laner may suggest that you are being ganked.\n\nGetting your Ultimate y will be a massive bonus in the lane. Now you can poke the enemy out of the lane without breaking any kind of sweat while maintaining distance from the enemy."}
{"text": "As naafiri, Start looking for roams after pushing the wave. You can start roaming after level 6.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate and look for kills whenever it is up.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to keep good objective control! Gank the bottom lane and then rotate to Drake.\n"}
{"text": "As zed, This is the point of the game where Zed will have a lot of difficulty in bringing down the enemies. That's because the enemies will buy defensive objects from now on. Yet, Zed should try to go for isolated targets when possible. At level 16, he will have his ultimate R maximd. This means that he will inflict massive amounts of damage to squishier targets and decimate anyone who has been caught alone / Zed will really have weak cooldowns now, and he can do a lot of damage because of that. This means that he will be the lot of squishier targets on the enemy team, and he can get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "As kaisa, It is important that you stay with your team in the late game. Do not move around the card or go anywhere unless someone is with you. Stand back from your team near your support. Avoid walking too far from anyone in the late game. Being caught will lead the enemy will be able to push his advantage and finish the game. Look at your positioning in the late game. Focus on the kiting and automatic attack of the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so that you are not taken out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "As darius, At level 9, Darius would have maximized his e. His all-in potential and the pressure to kill is still very good during the middle of the game. At level 11, Darius will put a secondary point in his Ultimate e. If he got a slight lead in the game early, he will be difficult to manage in the middle of the game, and he should be able to kill any enemy who tries to prevent him from sharing the push. During the middle of the game, Darius should have completed some articles. He should be able to do a lot of damage to the targets, and also be a bit tanky. The articles he picks up make him a huge problem during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As ahri, In the team fights at the end of the game, you can either look to flank and choose someone with your allies. It's a good way to play in the game at the end of the game if you're in advance. Just make sure you save 1 Ultimate pile to escape. Alternatively, you can peel for your carts and keep them alive: use your E on the closest target to your ADC and peel for them. The war fog is your friend and you should use this to set up death brushes with your team. This works especially well when a major fight is going to take place for a neutral goal like the Baron."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Once Quinn reaches level 6, her death pressure in a trade does not increase exactly as her Ultimate R is a utility tool. However, her ability to wander does. If she leaves the track, ping your teammates so they know that she is missing. Keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map in early play will allow you to get gold and XP without fear of Quinn zoner and deny you the farm."}
{"text": "As samira, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, The brief break between each enchantment pick-up will be your return time to harass her because she won't have a powerful Q that has an autonomy. Be careful when you go for short trades with Qiyana as she prefers them longer extended. If you meet her inside the jungle or in the river, don't fight her unless you get the jump on her or have a clear advantage. Qiyana will look at low health gank with CC. If she doesn't find any ganks early, she will feed the farm until 6 where she gets her R. Then she will actively look for gank when it comes to it. Try to get your ways forward so that she is less likely to pick up free murders."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Kayle is at her weakest in the early game. Try to abuse her weakness by playing aggressive and getting kills. Putting her behind in the early game will reduce her ability to carry later on in the game. \n\nKeeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map will force Kayle to overextend for farm. Once she walks up and tries to last hit, you could play aggressive and try to all-in her.\n\nOnce Kayle hits level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, she will also become ranged and she\u2019ll find it easier to last hit. She will be able to also poke you down and trade more effectively. You\u2019ll need to be more strategic when trying to fight her from now on."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the team fights at the end of the game. To make it easier to get to the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you're flanking a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the game at the end of the game because the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without that will make the team fighting at the end of the game much more difficult."}
{"text": "As azir, Your ability to control an area/area is quite strong and almost unmatched. You can cut down a lot of constant damage if you are lucky. Your sand soldiers and Passive make it much easier for you to stop all-in in their tracks. Very high seating and pushing power when it comes to taking lane towers. Your Ultimate R offers you luxury both disengagement and all-in-the-team enemy according to your requirement."}
{"text": "Against volibear, Buy items that provide Greek wounds such as Executioner=S Calling or Morellonomicon. This will prevent him from curing and surviving team fights. In team fights, avoid regrouping too closely as it will allow Volibear to get a great ultimate R out. Group, but not to stand too close together. Volibear has great potential of choice in the middle of play."}
{"text": "As shaco, Falls off like a truck if the game goes on for too long. During the late game, champions start building defensive items which don\u2019t allow Shaco to immediately assassinate someone.\n\nHe is quite squishy, and is quite prone to getting killed if CC\u2019d when his Ultimate l is down. He will need to play around this ability in order to succeed.\n\nNot a good pick against tanks as it would involve him changing his build and going up close and personal to those tanks. This is not very ideal, especially against experienced players."}
{"text": "As nidalee, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Stay with your team at the end of the game. Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, You can abuse this to get an early lead or blow his Spells of Invocation. At level 6, Kog-Maw will have easier time to make and trade thanks to his Ultimate there. Take care during trading with him, and try not to let him shoot you down. Kog-Maw benefits from extended trades once he has a few points in his e. Do not go for extended trades with him unless you have an advantage."}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Vladimir is at his weakest in the early game. Try your hardest to put him behind to make him less obnoxious in the mid and late game.\n\nAt level 9, Vladimir would\u2019ve maxed Q. It has a short cooldown and deals a lot of damage. Avoid letting him use it on you too much. \n\nVladimir is really good in the late game and in team fights. Try to end the game as quickly as you can so he is unable to spike."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Falls off during the late game. If he can\u2019t one-shot the person he is targeting, he will be crowd controlled almost immediately and killed on the spot.\n\nIncredibly vulnerable once his Ultimate R is on cooldown. The enemy team should be looking to fight him during this time and target him before anyone else.\n\nIsn\u2019t very effective against a group of champions as he is extremely reliant on picks to get a lead. Besides, crowd controlling him can allow the enemy team to get rid of him quite easily."}
{"text": "As ashe, Stand behind the minions to block its damage. Unfortunately, their level 6 is stronger than yours, so be careful when fighting post 6. Keep the wave closer to your side of the card in the game very early. It will protect you from the ganks and from them zoning you away from the farm. Ashe is good in the long trades, so avoid going for prolonged jobs with her, especially if her Q is stacked."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, This champion is an early game bully. Play aggressive throughout the laning phase to get kills. If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate e is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate e is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand has lots of poke with his W with the added benefit of it being long-ranged too. This allows him to poke the enemy down from afar and get them low. \n\nHe has really good wave clear and AOE thanks to his W. This is good for Brand as he can push the wave constantly and keep the enemy laner pushed into their tower.\n\nHis Ultimate R is really good in team fights- especially if the enemy are grouped together. He can make his Ultimate R bounce between enemies and deal a lot of damage."}
{"text": "Against talon, Place vision over walls and around his jungle entrances to spot Talon before he is able to jump over a wall with his E and gank a lane.\n\nTalon has good invade potential and can 1v1 most Junglers. Ensure your team has good vision of him at all times. If he invades you, back away unless you have a clear advantage.\n\nTalon doesn\u2019t have amazing Dragon or Rift Herald control in the early game. If you can, try to take these objectives before he is able to get help from a nearby lane."}
{"text": "As ksante, Your **W** is great against bursting because it reduces incoming damage. K-Sante has a lot of CC and can lock and lay CC on enemy champions. A lot of trading potential with its **Q** and base attacks. It can also run enemies and kill them thanks to how much CC it has in its kit."}
{"text": "As ahri, In the late game, you should be close to max build. You should be able to go down easily any champion you could contact with. Set up ambushes and look to blow up an unexpected enemy. Once you have level 16, you will have 3 points in your Ultimate. You can look for more aggressive games and look for spikes on extended targets. It will be on a cool lowdown in the late game, so don't be afraid to go for risky peaks as you can use it to escape if you miss your E. Ahri falls into the late game as the enemy will be healthier, and most champions will buy defensive items to protect them. It is unlikely that you will be able to blow up any first line champion, but you can quite easily remove the enemy Support or ADC."}
{"text": "As talon, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "Against udyr, Udyr has no reliable engage tool other than running towards your team. Kite him so he is unable to land his CC onto your carries.\n\nIf he ever uses his Flash E to engage, remember that he has no other escape tool. Focus him down as quickly as possible.\n\nAs he isn\u2019t really good in team fights, you could force a team fight while he is in his jungle farming, split pushing in a side lane or otherwise preoccupied. Fighting with the numbers advantage will make team fighting much easier."}
{"text": "As lulu, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "As yone, Flank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nAfter your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Throughout the laning phase, try and keep the wave closer to your side of the map. If you push, he could zone you away from the farm and kill you when you walk up to CS.\n\nMaster Yi is weak early, but will be stronger once he hits level 6. Take care and avoid staying in lane if you\u2019re low so you don\u2019t get killed by him.\n\nAvoid giving him kills early. Master Yi is a snowball heavy champion and can easily take over the map if you let him get ahead."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 11 is not a massive peak because it only gives a slight increase in capacity damage. That being said, the lower cooling certainly helps. Pantheon is quite decent during the middle of the game. That's because it can dry a lot of damage in a short time and can secure peaks all around the map. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This means that it can inflict a massive amount of burst damage to any enemy that it gets too close."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Expect Teemo to place the mushroom t in the river and around the Scuttle Crab and your entrances into the jungle. Opt for a scanning lens to reduce the chances of you walking in one. If you notice Teemo on the upper side of the map, try to invade the lower side of its jungle to steal its camps. This will make it really difficult to get gold and XP. It has little control over the Dragon and can't take it alone. If you are able to take it undisputed, you should do it. After all, it will just gank bot lane and take it with them if you don't get it before."}
{"text": "Against braum, Braum doesn\u2019t have the best of sustain in the early game. Try to harass and poke him down whenever he tries to last hit minions. If you can keep him low, he\u2019ll never be able to engage.\n\nIn team fights, avoid standing too close together as it will allow him to knock multiple champions up with his Ultimate r. Group but do not stand super close together.\n \nThe longer the game goes the tankier Braum gets and the stronger his ADC gets too. Try and set him behind in the early game to make it harder for him to peel for his ADC as the game goes along."}
{"text": "As yasuo, The incorrect use of his W can cause him to kill in the way. This is especially true against various matchups. The alternative is to step back, which allows the enemy of just Yasuo area of the wave. Very vulnerable to crowd control because it prevents him from throwing his E for a while. He can't throw E on the same target twice, so he can easily be taken out."}
{"text": "As rengar, Focus on agriculture and hit level 6 as fast as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your waste potential. Your ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Every time it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get murders. Try to secure goals with your team."}
{"text": "As rengar, The first element will allow him to do a lot of damage and be really heinous in the way. It will also be beneficial in trying to go for all-in combos. Level six is a decent peak for him because he can now shoot down enemies easily and wander around the map. His survival will also depend on his passive use. He is a powerful and boring champion early, especially if he manages to use the track brushes to his advantage in the way. His all-in combo will be quite powerful if he catches his out-of-guard enemies."}
{"text": "As tristana, She will have many items during the late game, which will allow her to blow squishies up and deal a lot of damage to grouped enemies. It will also let her take more minor damage due to life steal.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow Tristana to take over the game very quickly. The ability will be on a short cooldown which enables her to use it both aggressively and defensively when she wants to.\n\nAll her abilities will be maxed out by now, which means that she will be able to use her W to reposition herself frequently and deal massive amounts of damage to her enemies simultaneously."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Putting the second point in Fiddlesticks Ultimate R at level 11 is very important for him. It will put his Ultimate R on a shorter cooldown and allow him to look for more aggressive plays.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Fiddlesticks should\u2019ve completed an item or two. His damage output will be quite high which can allow him to win mid-game team fights.\n\nIn the mid-game, teams start to group. This is good for Fiddlesticks as he benefits from teams grouping closely together as his Ultimate R is an AOE tool."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Kog'Maw will have multiple items during this phase of the game. This will result in him dealing a lot of damage to enemies and just bursting down the enemy backline during a fight.\n\nKog'Maw is very squishy and can be killed quickly in the late game by assassins or enemies with tons of CC. He will have to rely on his team to help him survive.\n\nGetting 3 points in his Ultimate y will amplify the poke damage dealt by the ability. It will be his prominent damage-dealing ability that should hit like a truck at this point."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Ziggs will try to delay a team fight as long as possible while he launches with his Q. Try to force a fight so that he can't bring you down and force you to disengage. It's going to be hard for you to sit goals like Towers when Ziggs is alive. Try catching him out of his position or flancing him when he's alone to facilitate taking these goals."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin should finish the game with this point, as he will now begin to fall. He will always be able to choose enemies, however. Once Lee Sin gets 3 points in his Ultimate k, he will disrupt enemy fighting frequently and act as an asset for his team. Lee Sin will have several elements during this phase of the game. It will allow him to survive longer during his fights and allow him to play the role of the disruptor very effectively."}
{"text": "As braum, Just like the middle of the game, the teams will be regrouped during the end of the game. Braum will be very strong in the team fights at the end of the game. At level 13, Braum will maximize his E. He will be able to talk a lot of damage for his litters during the end of the game. At level 16, Braum will put the third and final point in his Ultimate r. He will be on a rather short cooldown that can allow him to start team fights on enemies who are taken out of position."}
{"text": "As kennen, Split push whenever your Ultimate m is down in the mid-game. While team fighting is important for Kennen, falling behind in gold and XP will make you pretty much useless in team fights.\n\nLook to flank in team fights. Fighting as Kennen can be difficult if the enemy is able to disengage or has poke damage. To make team fighting easier, look to flank from the side.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate m is up or whenever your team is ready, you should group with them."}
{"text": "As talon, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As gnar, Gnar can cause a lot of damage or be a peeler for his team in tanking a lot of damage. This versatility depends on his form at the time of the fight as well as his choice of construction. At level thirteen, he will have two of his capacities fully maximized. This will allow him to use more frequently his jump and poke abilities that can be very beneficial during the prolonged fighting. Gnar must play around his R Ultimate to make sure he is vital during the end of the match. Bonus points if he can use the fog of war in his favor."}
{"text": "Against gnar, Gnar needs his Ultimate R to be available and the only way he can get it is through changing into Mega Gnar. Try to team fight when he has very little Rage stacked, so he is unable to change forms.\n\nWhen Gnar is in Mega Form, and you\u2019re about to team fight, be prepared to disengage and call off a fight until he is in Mini Form. Gnar is very weak in team fights when he\u2019s in Mini Form.\n\nAvoid fighting in close proximity and in areas that are tight like near walls, around objectives or in the jungle. Fighting in these areas helps Mega Gnar get a good Ultimate R or a multi-person W.  "}
{"text": "As drmundo, You should look for early duels with Dr. Mundo, because your E will always give you a high hand in this matchup. Amplify the duel potential with an element of Wounds Grievous. Your Passive should allow you to detect Dr. Mundo with ease. This will be really useful when it comes to letting your teammates know where Dr. Mundo is. It will also allow you to keep the enemy jungle deep safely. You should have an easy time trying to spank the enemies with your E because it can allow you to catch them out of sight and shoot them down. Just make sure that Dr. Mundo is not nearby; otherwise, you cannot shoot the gank successfully. During team fighting, always try to target the enemy rear line and kill at least one enemy. It will also allow your team to deal with Dr. Mundo effectively if he decides to go solo."}
{"text": "As malphite, Make sure you put the emphasis on taking Dragons for your team. After ruining the lower lane and turning immediately, you can take the first Dragon. Your Ultimate is strong, so you have to abuse it to win an advance on Malphite. They will be ruined often, so you have to do it too. As you are great at duelling and early, try to make early games around the map to get yourself and your allies in advance. As Malphite is so weak early, just go into their jungle and try to fight them or force them to remember."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, At level 6, Seraphine will unlock her Ultimate R. This makes her more than one threat and she will be able to install her Jungler quite easily. Seraphine is good in the team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Avoid regrouping closely so that she is unable to get a powerful Ultimate Roff. Once Seraphine has finished her first element, her Q damage will increase and her threat to kill."}
{"text": "As gragas, Use the track brushes to hide and trample enemy travelers with your Q. It should prevent them from trying everything in your ADC in the way. Remember that your E can be interrupted by minions. That's why use your W to get closer to them and then E to CC them. Once you get your ultimate R, you should have much more efficiency in fighting enemies. Try to separate the ADC enemy from their Support for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "As viego, Having 3 points in his Ultimate R will help Viego take over the game effortlessly. His burst damage will increase significantly, and he will melt through the enemy team.\n\nHis Ultimate R will come in very handy during late-game fights. His ability to target the lowest health enemy will make quick work of enemies who have managed to escape with a sliver of health.\n\nViego is decent in team fights, mainly if he uses the fog of war and his E to get to the enemy backline. He can even use his E to zone the enemy off without even trying to kill anyone."}
{"text": "As sylas, Level 16 will see Sylas get a maximum of Ultimate R. The power of its Ultimate R will always depend on the enemy team's comp, but it will be able to use more ultimates in a given time. Its damage will be really significant during this phase of the game. The brilliant damage that it can make completely catch the out-of-guard enemies and ruin their chances of winning the game. Sylas is decent enough during late fighting as it can inflict tons of damage and heal itself for massive amounts at the right time. It will allow him to separate the enemy front line from the rear line and help his team a lot."}
{"text": "As xayah, Very immobile during the entirety of the game and can be shut down early on. She is very prone to ganks as well.\n\nHer E forms a vital part of her kit. Once that ability is down, the enemy can all-in her with ease and secure a kill on her.\n\nShe is very vulnerable once her Ultimate R is down. She can be focused down by CC as well as assassins at that point, so she is forced to play defensively while the Ultimate R is down."}
{"text": "As sett, It can be trapped to oblivion, especially when it is against a varied portage with a shape or dash or coat. Misuse of its W can cause it to kill because it is its only form of mitigation of damage. It cannot escape easily if someone includes it after using this ability. If the enemy is intelligent, they will avoid regrouping during the fighting. This will prevent Sett from effectively using its Ultimate R, as it was not able to land much damage or slow down several members of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac has great all-in potential throughout the laning phase. As soon as the enemy moves forward or overextends, he can look to play aggressive.\n\nHis Passive and Ultimate R can allow him to singlehandedly take a group of enemies out of a major team fight by simply zoning them away. He can also deal a lot of damage to the enemy backline if they ignore Zac.\n\nZac has good sustain in lane, thanks to his blobs. The additional health and sustain lets him survive harder matchups and out heal the enemy."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is one of the first strongest game champions in the game. You can use this advantage to gain an early lead. Extended trades work in favor of Darius thanks to his passive. He will win almost all automatic attack battles. This makes him a great duelist in the bottom ELO as many players like to fight constantly. Is really good in team fights thanks to his Ultimate e that can be reset if he gets the shot of death with her."}
{"text": "As qiyana, She has tons of combos to master. This makes her a mechanically difficult champion to play and do well. Expect to put in a lot of games to control her. According to her Element, she can be a less effective laner. The enemy will always know which Element you have and they will be able to play around him. Also, having a certain Element may not be useful in the way. If Qiyana is behind, she will not do any harm in team fighting."}
{"text": "As briar, Needs her team to follow up in team fights or else she will get blown up.\n\nThe interaction between her E and W is a bit annoying.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t fight in the jungle or near walls, she is missing out on extra CC.\n"}
{"text": "As swain, Very motionless and weak at the beginning of the laning phase. It is especially true if he is confronted with a champion who can all-in and CC him. Is quite vulnerable when his E is down as is his main form of CC. Painful injuries can completely counter his kit at the beginning of the game and also affect his playing environment. He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he has won."}
{"text": "As senna, Consider investing in healing reduction items or capabilities to counter Senna's maintenance. This can help reduce their ability to heal and trade effectively during skirmishes and all-in. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This encourages Senna and their ADC to extend, creating opportunities for your gank jungler and potentially secure kills or summons spells. Enjoy the windows of the opportunity to detach your ADC and harass Senna when they have used one of their abilities. This disadvantages them in trades because they have less ability to exchange effectively."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Caitlyn has lots of range and early poke. She can get an early lead purely by constantly pushing the minion wave and getting tower plates.\n\nCaitlyn\u2019s early game is really good and if she\u2019s able to get a lead, it will be hard for the enemy ADC to catch up to her.\n\nHer Ultimate R is really good at executing enemies if they\u2019re alone and low. It can be difficult to use in some scenarios though, but if the enemy is low, it should result in an easy kill."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo will place tons of mushroom t around the targets and in the high traffic areas. Make sure to buy Control Wards and avoid obvious paths around the map. Teemo is really squishy, so if you can catch it as it goes into the room, you will increase your chances of winning the fight."}
{"text": "As taric, Once Taric gets 3 points in his Ultimate R, he will have a really easy time fighting with enemies. The brief period of invulnerability can easily win Taric's team the game.\n\nTaric is quite decent in team fights. This is mainly because of his Ultimate R, which allows him to defend high-priority targets while the enemy team takes damage.\n\nTaric is also quite tanky during this phase of the game because he will have many items now. This will make him an effective peeler for his ADC and his team."}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen is strong at level 6 while he gets a global card pressure with his Ultimate R. Ping as soon as he gets his Ultimate R. Shen at levels 2 and 3 can be strong enough. If he's in a favorable matchup, it's not impossible for him to look for an early one. Keep an eye on Shen items as soon as his damage production increases according to the order of the items he buys."}
{"text": "As sona, She is pretty weak early on, so she will want to use her Q to damage enemies occasionally and use the lane brushes to drop vision on her.\n\nLevel six is the central power spike for Sona in the early game. It will let her be effective in team fights, and now she can easily change the tide of a fight.\n\nThe first item component increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a bit more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will need to be careful about spamming spells.        "}
{"text": "As taliyah, After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nTry and siege objectives with your team during the mid-game. You have strong poking tools which will allow you to siege objectives with ease. Try to poke the enemy down as much as possible while your team tries to take towers (or the Dragon or Baron).\n\nDelay team fights for as long as possible while you harass the enemy and poke them down with your Q."}
{"text": "As teemo, It can wander around the map and place its Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow it to detect enemies as well as get killed on unsuspecting low-health targets. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow it to inflict high amounts of bursting damage and will allow it to kill its enemies quickly. It is not remarkable in team fighting, so it should either resort to secure peaks and blow people with its abilities or just separate by pushing until the enemy responds to it."}
{"text": "As lux, Her e will allow her to peel multiple carries at the same time. The shield will be powerful, so it will work really well against assassination attempts.\n\nGetting 3 points in her Ultimate n will give her a massive damage boost. She will be a source of constant DPS, even if she goes for a fully-fledged Support build.\n\nShe will have multiple items during this phase of the game, which will make her shields and abilities way more potent. It helps her deal with burst damage and/or an enemy team filled with hard CC."}
{"text": "As lux, Once she gets multiple items, she will be bursting down enemies left, right, and center. All she needs to do is sit in the fog of war and wait for an unsuspecting enemy to walk in on her.\n\nAt level 16, Lux will mega-spike. This is due to her Ultimate n being upgraded to level three. She will now blow up enemies with the Ultimate n alone, and the ability's cooldown will be negligible.\n\nHer g will be on a very low cooldown now, and the Jungle will be her playground. She can easily catch and burst down squishy targets who are squandering around in their Jungle."}
{"text": "As warwick, Keep running around the map and look for picks with your Jungler. Your W and E should allow you to CC and kill enemies quickly.\n\nDuring neutral objective fights, you should be able to help your teammates a lot by making sure that the enemy can't get into the river. This will let your Jungler have an easy time getting the objective in question.\n\nYou should be able to sustain yourself massively in this fight so make sure you use your *Q* and Ultimate R regularly and properly. Avoid getting CC'd at all costs while doing so."}
{"text": "As bard, Bard\u2019s first power spike is once he hits level 2. As long as you\u2019ve picked up a few meeps before the minions spawn, you will always hit level 2 before the enemy. Make sure you harass and play aggressive while the enemy is still level 1.\n\nOnce Bard has picked up Boots, his roaming potential increases dramatically. Look to roam frequently with your E to help your allies around the map.\n\nBard\u2019s next power spike in lane is his level 6. His Ultimate R is pretty versatile and can be used to set up plays with your Jungler. Ensure you throw the Ultimate R behind the enemy as they may walk into it while trying to escape."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Yasuo is really strong once he has 100% chance of writing. Thanks to his passive, he can arrive at this stage quite quickly. Once Yasuo is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his pressure to kill increases. You should play respectfully whenever his Ultimate R is standing as he can quite easily kill you. Yasuo is really good in team fights if he is chosen in a team with several knock-ups."}
{"text": "As gnar, Avoid getting poked out by his Q in this matchup. It does a lot of damage and can cause issues for you in this matchup.\n\nOnce he gets his Ultimate, you will want to be very careful in this matchup. Failing to do so can easily get you pinned and killed.\n\nShort trades are generally a bad idea for you due to how your kit functions and your lack of mobility. Try to get to the enemy backline when possible to cause mayhem.\n\nKeep the wave somewhere in the middle of the lane. It will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down."}
{"text": "As morgana, Her damage during this phase of the game is immense. She just needs to land her Q, and her W and Ultimate R can do the rest.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow Morgana to frequently use her Ultimate R.

She will deal a lot of damage while also ensuring that one of her carries or she is CC immune."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is hard to play in a variety of champions. They can constantly harass and intimidate him which will make him difficult to survive the early game. Your Q will only be as impacted as you do. If you use your Q without multiple piles, the damage will be futile. His W does not block turn shots, but it increases his defensive stats."}
{"text": "Against velkoz, Vel\u2019koz first major power spike is once he hits level 6 as his Ultimate R offers him tons of kill pressure.\n\nOnce Vel\u2019koz has his first item completed, he will be constantly pushing the minion wave and trying to poke you down.\n\nVel\u2019koz is really good in team fights thanks to the poke and AOE damage from his abilities. Try to fight when he is not there or when his Ultimate R is down."}
{"text": "As yone, At level 6, Yone will unlock his Ultimate R, which will allow him to set up games with ease for his Jungler and his team during any stage of the game. Yone will get short peaks of power as he continues to add points to his Q. This will allow him to go for short gusts against his laner so he can do everything later. The first element will bring significant improvements to Yone's trading in the track. Depending on the component he gets, the effects will vary, but it will be good for him independently."}

Being hit by his Ultimate R can allow his team to either kill the caught out enemies or focus the enemies who are not golden.\n\nBecause Bard\u2019s Q can stun enemies who are close to a wall, be prepared to take an alternative route when walking towards the Dragon or Baron. Being stunned and killed before a major objective spawns will result in the enemy taking the objective for free.\n\nOverstaying while low under your own tower is a big no-no against Bard. Thanks to his Ultimate R, he can put your Tower in stasis and kill you shortly afterwards."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Can't gank very efficiently until she gets her level six. She will be heavily dependent on the enemy team pushing up and will therefore spend most of the time in power farming. Control Wards are her deadly enemies. If the enemy team invests a lot in them and places them in key points, it will become very difficult for Evelynn to pull successful ganks. She will have to be really careful while she's getting someone when her Ultimate R is on cooldown. It's very important when she gets someone who has a lot of CC in their kit."}

His W and E should help him a lot.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike as it allows him to escape from botched fights and use it aggressively when needed. It will also make it easier for him to take over enemy champions.\n\nViego has really great objective control because his abilities do a lot of damage and that he can melt through them very quickly. He should try to gank his bot lane, get the enemy to recall, and then ask for assistance when trying to kill the neutral objective."}

This puts the additional task of making sure that you are positioned well during fights as one misstep can get you killed.\n\nThe enemy team will look to gank you multiple times during the laning phase to set you back. Although it doesn't affect your utility, you won't be able to get enough items to impact fights later on which will cost your team multiple fights and objectives.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate w is down, you have little to no self peel.

Avoid walking in areas where you know that Sion has been so much harder for you to get caught by him. Kite and disengagement is Sion is the biggest threat in a team fight. Try to keep him away from your team so that he is unable to get a good Q knockup. Avoid regrouping and fighting in the jungle as it will allow Sion to get a very good knockup with his Q or get a very good Ultimate Roff. Group together, but not stand on each other so he is unable to get a multi-person knockup."}
{"text": "Against fizz, When you play as a melee champion, don't go for prolonged trades with Fizz because he'll always go out ahead with his W.

Fizz has a potential for crazy roaming. Don't follow him blindly because he can easily turn around and kill you."}

Her Q will hurt more, and you should invest in extra sustain to keep you healthy in this lane."}
{"text": "As gwen, In the first levels, play safely and avoid engaging in any occupation. Your early game is rather weak, so you're probably going to lose jobs compared to an aggressive laner. Once your passive piled up, you can look for fights with the enemy. The search for skirmishes when your passive piled up will increase your damage production and increase your chances of killing the enemy. Focus on good wave management and go to favorable trades. If you constantly push, you won't be able to get murders like your W won't protect you from tricks."}
{"text": "As zilean, Beast out his first Q and then all of him with your W. Go for the aggressive game at level 2 to get an important health advance. Keep the wave closer so that you can all of it to him many times. Stand outside the wave, so when he makes Q the wave, it does not damage you at the same time."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Your early goal is to keep them down. Try to avoid going for extended jobs because they will often win those. Treat for their level 2 all-in. They can play aggressively at level 2 and gain an important advance in health. Similarly, try to keep the minion wave even or closer to your side of the map. This will reduce its all-in potential and keep you safe. You are stronger than them at level 6, as your Ultimate can be used in a fight. But, the utility they provide ina skirmish is also very valuable and their Support could be everything in you at level 6."}

{"text": "As yasuo, Very strong when the enemy is pushed up and a new minion wave is approaching. This allows him to use his E to catch up to his enemy laner and then knock them up with his r. Yasuo can quite easily set up ganks with this tactic as well.\n\nPlaying around the W can allow him to completely dismantle ranged enemy matchups. He can run around the windwall and save himself from a lot of damage this way. Agaisnt melee champions, it is always wise to back off and maintain some distance from them.\n\nPost-six, he becomes extremely strong due to his Ultimate R crowd control as well the bonus armor penetration he gets upon using it. Combined with his item powerspikes, it makes him a force to be reckoned with, even if he is behind in lane."}

Team fights will be really useful due to her d.\n\nShe will have two of her abilities maxed out at level 13, which will give her a huge damage boost and will let her peel for her carries effortlessly. It will be really helpful in winning fights."}

Nautilus has the most CC of any Champion in the Legends League."}
{"text": "Against jax, Aim to trade when Jax has used his E as it will block the basic attacks. He has a long cooldown, so make sure to exploit his weakness. Jax has no build-in support and is melee. If you have the edge of range, try poke and harass him as much as possible to prevent him from looking for all-in. It will also force him to burn through his potions quickly."}
{"text": "As ashe, You are extremely strong during the laning phase because of your long-range poke and self-attacks. This allows you to play safely, chip on your enemy's health bar, and then all of it with your auto-auto-auto-Q auto-attacks. The amount of utility you bring to a team comp is massive. Your auto-attack slows down and your Ultimate w CC can easily help your team to secure choices before the important goal fights. It also helps you increase the CC chains on the enemies. Once you get two to three items, you can start slowing down and shredding several members of the enemy team in battles near the quarter. This gives you more time to kite out enemies during the skirmishes and keeps you safe from their CC while your team piles on them."}
{"text": "Against camille, Try and stay closely grouped as a team when playing against Camille to make it very hard for her to engage. Camille will want to lock down an isolated target with her Ultimate R, but by standing close together it will reduce her ability to do so.\n \nCamille will often hunt vulnerable targets who are isolated walking around the map. Stick with your team to reduce Camille\u2019s assassination attempts.\n \nIn addition to grouping closely, Camille cannot easily get on to the backline by running at the enemy. Instead, she will try to flank from the side. So whenever you\u2019re sieging an objective or fighting in a lane, make sure you have sufficient ward coverage to the sides so you can spot her before she engages."}
{"text": "As sett, It can be wise to save your E} to avoid at least the real portion of Setts W damage. After your level 9 pick-up, keep the minion wave crashing into the Setts tower so you can punish it with your Q to punish it for CSing and opportunities to play games with your jungler. Aatrox does not heal the Setts W shield. Refuse the casting abilities with the intention of damaging it when it has its shield activated unless you watch CC. Play safe at early levels, because Sett has a potential to kill high against you. Your game style should change to the poking after level 9 and reach 20% cooling reduction through the articles."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus is at its weakest in early play. Try to deny as many piles as possible by invading it so it is unable to scale quickly. The more the game goes, the stronger Nasus gets.

If it so happens that the enemy side laners are low, you can quickly E in and get some kills.\n\nYour Ultimate will help you a lot in this game but make sure that you position correctly.

{"text": "Against fiora, If you are unhappy with the marked area, returning to a certain distance will reset the position. Playing around the W of Fiora is a focal point of the track. Try to bait it before you all in it to prevent it from neglecting your CC. Keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map will make it very difficult for it to chase you and kill you in the way. If you push and freeze, you will be very vulnerable to the ganks and all-in of Fiora."}
{"text": "As khazix, The Jungler game is a strong and early game. Look for gank and go for duels frequently with the enemy. Getting an early murder or two will make the game much easier for you. Concentrate on securing goals. As you are the Jungler after all, make sure you try to take them as often as possible. Your champion is very good to take them alone. While you are a strong and good fighter in early play, you need to make sure that you take time to focus on agriculture and win gold and XP. Secure your camps as often as possible."}
{"text": "Against quinn, At level 1, don't let her intimidate you with her basic attacks. Unlike the other champions, Quinn's level 6 power peak does not offer her much in the way. But her Ultimate R offers her a lot of roaming potential. As soon as she reaches level 6 and disappears, communicator with your team to let them know that she is on the left. Once Quinn has finished her first element, her death pressure increases. If you are behind, avoid fighting her at all costs because she will probably beat you in 1v1."}

Their Ultimate offers them a ton of extra pressure to kill. Playing smart and remember when you're weak then Rakan can't use their Ultimate to run you. As Rakan has a lot of built-in support, make sure you get some form of healing reduction quickly to make you easier to kill them. To cancel all-in opportunities and reduce Rakan's trading potential, it's essential to keep the wave closer to your side of the map, which will also help set up your Jungler."}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, Tahm Kench\u2019s level 6 r is one of his major power spikes. It offers him extra kill pressure. Keep this in mind when skirmishing post 6.\n\nTahm\u2019s early game is rather weak. Try and abuse this to get an early led.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger and tankier Tahm Kench will become. Put him behind in the early game to reduce his potentness in the late game."}
{"text": "Against warwick, Warwick will look to pick someone off with his Ultimate R to start the fight. Make sure your flanks are warded so you can spot him before he is able to catch someone out of position. \n\nTry to poke and delay a team fight for as long as possible. Warwick is vulnerable to poke and disengage and if you\u2019re able to poke him down, it will be risky for him to engage.\n\nGetting Ulted R by Warwick in a team fight can be game-changing. Be prepared to Flash his engage if you have it up. If not, invest in a QSS so you can escape the CC or lock him down/ interrupt his channel with CC."}
{"text": "As drmundo, The fact that he is extremely weak at the beginning of the game does not help him either. Often, he lacks his Qs can take a huge tribute on his health. It is also his main ability to catch up so that the enemy can try to bring him down for a little while if Mundo misses his Q on them. This fact is especially true when he is against various port carriers. It is very motionless, which makes it very easy for the enemy Jungler to inflate his way."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, In the middle of the game, you will want to take several fights and move forward. It will be hard enough for enemies to kill you if you don't get CC'd. Your W and E will be instrumental for your success in this matchup, especially during the ganks. Install some death brushes in the jungle whenever possible. Do not take full team fights. Instead, rely on peaks to win the middle of the game. It should be easy enough to do if you use the fog of war correctly."}
{"text": "As pyke, Level 16 is a massive spike for Pyke as the ability will now be up almost every team fight. The damage done will be pretty significant as well, and he can take multiple enemies down simultaneously.\n\nPyke is outstanding in mid-game fights as his Ultimate R threshold will be pretty high. This means that he can easily catch enemies off-guard and blow them up.\n\nPyke is quite decent at getting picks during the late game. He can single-handedly set up death brushes and get rid of squishy targets."}
{"text": "As maokai, His early laning is not particularly strong, but he can use the lane brushes and his E to keep the enemy laner at bay.

The allied Jungler will have an easy time ganking this lane.\n\nThe first item component will allow Maokai to survive longer and dish out more consistent damage in the lane.

This can make the team fight difficult for a Trendamere."}
{"text": "As sylas, Level 6 is a variable power peak highly dependent on the composition of the enemy team.

It will also dry up a lot of damage during the duels and heal with its W when necessary."}
{"text": "As sylas, His ultimate R is completely dependent on the comp enemy team. If the enemy has ultimate lacklust, Sylas will not be able to do much.

Avoid going anywhere that Teemo has recently been in without a Sweeping Lens. He and his teammates may be ready and waiting and try and pounce on you.\n\nAs Teemo will be split pushing or away from his team during fights, you could use the numbers advantage to force a fight 4v4 or 5v4. Just keep an eye on him and be prepared to rotate if he gets close to your tower."}
{"text": "As sona, She's pretty weak early, so she'll want to use her Q to damage enemies from time to time and use track brushes to drop the vision on her. Level six is the central power point for Sona in the early game. It will allow her to be effective in team fighting, and now she can easily change the tide of a fight. The first element increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a little more frequently."}

As long as he can stick to an enemy champion, he should win 1v1 fights.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to both get tanks off his carries as well as deal a lot of damage to the enemy team if he manages to ult his target into them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant.\n\nHis Passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so he can resort to short burst trades against enemy champions unlike other tanks.

{"text": "As soraka, Her healing is quite intimidating during this part of the game. She should keep her alive with her W and Ultimate R. Her first ability will be maximized to level 9. Depending on the ability she chooses, she will either dry up a lot of damage and heal herself or just heal her allies and keep them alive. She is perfect in the middle of the game due to her powerful healing and her ability to systematically dry up a lot of damage to enemies. Melee's champions will have a hard time against her."}
{"text": "As annie, Look for aggressive parts at level 2 that you are stronger than it at level 2. Look for aggressive parts when its dizziness is down. Fight it after it uses its dizziness that you will win a battle with it. After you have obtained your first element, just keep pushing it in and get turn plates. Look for roaming opportunities when possible."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, The first power peak of Shyvana is at level 6 when it unlocks its Ultimate t as it allows it to change shapes. The more the game goes, the stronger the Shyvana becomes. In the middle of the game, its release of poke and damage will be very high. Don't let its poke come down to you. Each Dragon provides Shyvana with a buff that not only helps his entire team, but he also drinks it directly thanks to his Passive. Don't let her take every Dragon if possible."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Nocturne is easy to learn and does not take hundreds of games to learn like some champions in the game. Nocturne is a great assassin who can come out on anyone who walks alone around the card. This makes his potential of choice incredibly high. It has a great roaming capacity and can be moved literally anywhere on the map quickly with its Ultimate a."}
{"text": "As ezreal, If you waste your E, the enemy has time to enter it. Buffering your E can be extremely difficult against some champions. It will often leave beginners in a sticky situation. It is mechanically a very difficult champion. While it is easy to pick up, it is difficult to master."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus is at his weakest in the early game. Try to deny as many stacks as possible so he is unable to scale quickly.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Nasus gets. Make sure you end the game as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile he will be focusing on farming, once he has his Ultimate R, his kill pressure will increase and so will his survivability. Make sure you\u2019re not too cocky otherwise he can turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Watch your positioning in team fights as Morgana will try to catch someone out with her Q. Make sure you stand in an appropriate position so you\u2019re able to dodge it. Don\u2019t stand too far forward nor too far back.\n\nOnce Morgana has gone fishing with her Q, she is relatively defenceless which you can capitalise on. As soon as she uses her Q, charge at her and try to take her down.\n\nWhenever Morgana casts her Ultimate R in a team fight, try to get out of the area as quickly as you can so you do not get chained down and CC\u2019d."}
{"text": "Against galio, Try and stay at the maximum range at any time to make it very difficult for Galio to use his E and W aggressively to tease you. It is much stronger and has good gank set up when it is healthy and these two abilities are increasing. Galio, the biggest peak of power is reached at level 6. His R gives a great opportunity to gank and to help other lines or to present himself in a team struggle. However, it does not have much to kill the threat against enemy travelers in a 1v1 at level 6. After Galio has finished his first article and has many points in his Q and E, he will be able to quickly push the wave and roll."}
{"text": "As zac, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing up. Fighting with outside will make the fights of the late game team much harder. Delay fighting and be ready to disengage if it's still on cooldown."}
{"text": "As tristana, It will have a lot of articles during the end of the game, which will allow it to blow squishies up and inflict a lot of damage to the grouped enemies. It will also allow it to take more minor damage due to the theft of life. A full-maximum Out Ultimate R will allow Tristana to resume the game very quickly. The ability will be on a short cooldown that allows her to use it both aggressively and defensively when she wants it. All her abilities will be maximized now, which means she will be able to use her W to reposition frequently and inflict massive amounts of damage to her enemies simultaneously."}
{"text": "As nidalee, She is pretty intense during the early game as her clears are pretty quick. She can burst enemies and duel them quite efficiently early on.\n\nUnlike other champions, level six isn't a massive spike as it doesn't provide her with a lot. On the other hand, her early game power is due to the Ultimate r transformation.\n\nThe first item component will allow her to duel enemies more easily. It will also let her use her abilities quite frequently.        "}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level 3 is a decent powerpike because Heimerdinger will have access to all its capabilities. It can easily ADC still CC and explodes them with its turrets and rockets. Its E will be very beneficial in going for objective battles. Level 6 is undoubtedly a colossal peak of power for Heimerdinger, as it can now lure enemies to their death with ease. It can also take towers very quickly or slow several enemies with its E. The first mythical element will allow Heimerdinger to deposit a ton of damage of poke in the track with its turrets. Its gust damage will also be quite powerful, and it can fire an enemy with the greatest ease."}
{"text": "As quinn, She should be trying to secure picks in the enemy Jungle. Focusing on squishier targets should be her main goal.\n\nLooking for flanks on the enemy backline will be an essential power move for Quinn during this phase of the game.

That, combined with her W will allow her to provide some utility to her team."}
{"text": "As ivern, Keep looking for choices with your Q and A. If you are able to get a choice, try to abuse the number advantage and finish the game. Again, stay with your team and avoid walking too far from them. If your ADC gets caught, then the chances of winning will be reduced. So, by sticking with them, you will increase your chances of winning. Keep peeling for your team in team fights. Make sure to keep them alive as long as possible."}
{"text": "As neeko, You can work with your support and use the track brushes to get as many peaks on the enemy. When you use your E, try to get both minions and the enemy with it. It will help you wave and automate the ability at the same time. Once you get your first element, your brilliant damage will be really high. Just make sure you don't get CC'd for a big all-in, you will definitely end up dying."}
{"text": "As zilean, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate from them or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy with your Q and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not let yourself be caught trying to harass and bring down the enemy."}
{"text": "Against zyra, Lookout for ambushes by Zyra. One of Zyra's greatest strengths is its potential of choice. Avoid walking around Rift Summoners alone. Avoid fighting around the jungle or close goals because the teams will be pretty close together that could allow it to land a multi-person E and Ultimate R. Poke and fort all are really good against Zyra."}
{"text": "As corki, Try to browse the map and help your allies. Push the wave and then wander. When you use your capabilities on the minion wave, try to target your b and e so that it hits both the enemy and the minion wave at the same time.

{"text": "As akali, Akali runs out of energy quite easily. You\u2019ll need to keep a constant eye on your energy levels and only go in for aggressive plays when you have lots of energy.\n\nAkali and assassins like her struggle against teams with lots of CC. In team fights, you\u2019ll have to wait for the perfect opportunity to go in so you do not get CC\u2019d and killed pretty much instantly.\n\nAkali is one of the hardest champions to master in the game. Playing around her energy levels, her Passive, her W and her two mobility spells takes a lot of practice. Expect to put in a lot of effort if you want to learn Akali."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn is not the strongest at level 6 because his Ultimate R cannot be used in skirmishes. You can use this to your advantage during trading to get a murder. However, Quinn has a good priority of roam post 6 and can push the wave and then wander in the middle to help her mid-laner. Ping if she does. When Quinn finished her first component element, she can go for much stronger trades against you. If you are a weak early game ADC or if she has the advantage of the article, don't trade with her."}
{"text": "As sett, Can be kited to oblivion, especially when he is against a ranged carry with some form of dash of peel.\n\nMisuse of his W can get him killed as it is his only form of damage mitigation. He can\u2019t escape easily if someone all-ins him after he uses this ability.\n\nIf the enemy is smart, they will avoid grouping up during fights. This will prevent Sett from using his Ultimate R effectively, as he won\u2019t be able to land a lot of damage or slow multiple members of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As rakan, Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. Your goal during the laning phase is to search for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As twitch, Its positioning is important in team battles as well, otherwise it can be flanked by enemy assassins and be immediately removed. Without its Ultimate c or s, its ability to dominate a team struggle decreases considerably. The fight during this stage will give the enemy team a much greater chance of winning. Virtually gets counterbalanced by a Control Ward because it forces it to reroute. It is because of the short-term nature of its automatic attacks, which allows it to detect itself quite easily."}
{"text": "As yasuo, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily.

{"text": "As belveth, Bel\u2019Veths early objective control is very strong due to her high attack speed and low cooldowns. She can also turn into her True Form after killing it and then use this to punish any pursuing enemies.\n\nBel\u2019Veth will get significantly stronger with each time she recalls, due to how much she benefits from every piece of attack speed she buys. Once she\u2019s completed that first Mythic item, she\u2019s going to be a lot harder to deal with, especially if she gets it earlier than expected.\n\nMore attack speed means a lower cooldown on her Q, which is her bread and butter ability, aiding her damage, mobility and clear speeds. The sooner she gets that attack speed, the stronger she gets.\n"}
{"text": "As diana, Try flancing in the team fights with your Q and t to access the enemy rear line and close them. Flank on the side instead of running directly to the enemy as they will be able to disengage or drop you. When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done. Avoid overextension or die alone. When you are dead, the enemy may be able to sit a goal, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}

This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As malphite, Weak during the early game, especially against consistent poke damage which can prevent him from regenerating his Passive shield.\n\nPre-six, he is quite susceptible to poke so he will be forced to play defensively. He probably won\u2019t be getting any ganks either due to him not having his Ultimate h.\n\nProper vision control from the enemy team will prevent Malphite from catching the enemy team off-guard. This will reduce his effectiveness and will force him to find other ways to engage on the enemy team. "}
{"text": "Against rell, Avoid fighting in areas of the map that force your champions to be close to one another. Rell\u2019s Ultimate R is a great team fighting tool that can CC multiple enemies at once.\n\nCC and interrupts are the best way to counter Rell\u2019s W engage in team fights. Hold on to these abilities to interrupt her engage and burst her down while she is immobilized. \n\nLook out for Rell\u2019s E. She will put it on other champions who also want to engage to get a good stun off. "}
{"text": "As sion, Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs. As you are not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Ziggs is really in good team battles because it will allow him to oppose with his Q. Another thing he can do is to move the enemies with his W to prevent them from reaching the neutral and objective hole. He can even make it from war fog for maximum effect. At level 9, the Q of Ziggs will be maximized. This ability has a huge hitbox, and he can easily continue to prick and sit the enemy off the track. This is very beneficial in the middle track, especially when he is against a melee match. At level 11, Ziggs will have two points in a Ultimate R. This will give him a massive boost in his overall damage and catch the out-of-guard enemies quite easily. It will also allow him to attack dead people from far away."}
{"text": "As varus, Once you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to make choices all around the map with your teammates. Work with your Jungler to do so whenever possible. During neutral objective fights, you should be able to disrupt a fight due to your Ultimate R, especially if the enemy is tainted. Just make sure you land the ability. Try to land your Q regularly on several people of the enemy team. This will force them to play safely and then your team can all in and finish the job."}
{"text": "As camille, In the last game, Camille is good at choosing champions with his Ultimate R. It should be on a cool down low and if you are able to Ult R the right champion (like a cart), you could win the game. Although you have a good potential of choice, the enemy will start building defensive statistics that will make it harder for you to kill the carts on your own. Keep this in mind when you dive with your E. Although you will find it harder to kill carts on your own, you will be quite tanky and will suffer a lot of damage thanks to the items you buy."}
{"text": "As sona, During the middle of the game, you will want to group as much as possible. This will help you deal with the enemies who are more tanker than you. You will be safe enough from the assassins as well. Your Q should do a lot of damage now. Make sure to get the enemy down before you all in them, you may not have enough damage to kill your target. Fight around closed areas whenever possible, as your Ultimate R will be quite easy to land there. Cooling will also be reduced, which will allow you to use capacity frequently."}

{"text": "As cassiopeia, Although you can activate your W while you are in its W (Miasma), if your champion model is in the W, you will not be hit and the ability will always be used if you try to use it on yourself. Use it on it to hit it instead. Cassiopeia can easily close under its turret, and although Cassiopeia does not have a CC configuration, it can follow and be very successful with ganks with its W. This gives you good reasons to freeze the wave as much as you can and ask for ganks to abuse its poor early game. Cassiopeia needs to land several E= (Twin Fangs) after her Q (Noxious Blast) or W to do big damage, you should be able to hit it with your W to deter its aggression, or with a well placed E Cassiopeia at level 6 becomes very strong, but her Ultimate R will stun you if you are facing it."}

Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map so that you can protect yourself against their all-in. If they wander, ping and communicate with your team. You can't match their roams. Abuse your range in poking with your abilities. Try to self-attack when you can, but don't force it."}

{"text": "As nasus, Your champion is weak in the early game. Avoid fighting until you have a few levels behind you.

This will make you more than one threat in the later parts of the game."}
{"text": "As renata, If you are in a game where you want your ADC to scale, focus on using your Q defensively. Being a part of team fighting and neutral objective fighting is a must. Your W has a very good chance of reviving someone but always prioritize an ally that can destroy the enemy quickly in the period of disintegration. Once you get your ultimate R, look for the most jungle fighting you can. Sit in a Jungle brush and wait for a group of enemies to walk towards you."}
{"text": "As warwick, Has great sustain in lane thanks to his Q and the items he will pick up throughout the laning phase.\n\nGood pick potential throughout the game with his Ultimate R.

{"text": "As zilean, At level 16, his Ultimate t will be completely out of date. This means that he can use his Ultimate t way more frequently, which will be a source of nuisance for the enemy team. This is the point of the game where the teams come together that allows Zilean to use his Ultimate t to save his primary portals from certain situations of death. It will also allow him multi-target CC with his Q > W > Q. His Q will be on a cool down which means that he can constantly poke and harass the enemy."}
{"text": "As zeri, Zeri\u2019s first power spike is at level 3 when she unlocks each of her basic abilities. She will be relatively strong at level 3.\n\nHer next power spike will generally be once she unlocks her first component item as it allows her to go for more favourable trades with the enemy laner.\n\nAt level 6, Zeri will unlock her Ultimate R. This is a good spike for Zeri and it will allow her to win all-ins even in the hardest of matchups."}
{"text": "As anivia, At first, make sure you are in full control of the track brushes. Try to land your t out of sight for maximum impact. Your e should be used to block the escape of the enemy.

Use the track brushes and combine your e with the ability to block the escape of the enemy."}
{"text": "As nunu, Really bad against disengage champions as he can\u2019t do anything to avoid getting disrupted while he is using his W.\n\nDisengage and CC can also interrupt his Ultimate R, which can lead to very less damage output from his end.\n\nHealing reduction can easily counter him during the early game. This will allow the enemy to take Objectives quite easily after getting rid of Nunu as he won\u2019t be able to heal a lot."}
{"text": "As yone, Once he gets to level 16, he will use his Ultimate R way more frequently. This means he can pick off enemies easily, as well as CC multiple enemies during team fights.\n\nYone will have all his items completed by this time. This means that he will hit like a truck, and anyone who gets caught out by him will probably end up dying.\n\nYone is superb during the late game as his items will be completed, and he will have reached his most powerful powerspike. If the enemy team happens to be CC-heavy, he should get some defensive item to preserve his power."}

If his team is behind, it will be hard for him to do much in the fight.\n\nHis E is very telegraphed and can be dodged easily if the enemy sees you using it.

Keep an eye on your mana bar when you\u2019re without your blue buff."}
{"text": "As zeri, Unique Mechanic with his Q and the basic attacks. This can be difficult to master. She is pretty weak from behind, but again are many other champions.

{"text": "As varus, His Q poke is powerful during the early game. Depending on the build, the poke amount will vary, but it is his most reliable poke spell in the lane.\n\nOnce he hits level six, his kill pressure skyrockets. He can now use his Ultimate R to CC enemy champions and then work with his Support to layer CC on the said target.\n\nVarus' first item is going to give him a huge power spike. This simply means that his burst damage combo will do a lot of damage and can completely destroy any immobile or CC'd carry."}

After Camille has finished her Mythic article, her killer pressure and her potential 1v1 increases sharply. If you weren't a threat before then, you will certainly be now as your Myth gives you so much trading power."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Throughout the laning phase, try to keep the wave closer to your side of the map. If you push, it could zone you away from the farm and kill you when you walk up to CS.

Avoid walking in area\u2019s that are unwarded unless you know where Xin Zhao is.\n\nWhenever Xin Zhao\u2019s Ultimate R  is on cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable.

{"text": "As kayle, A very weak early game pushes her to have no form of lane presence. She is an easy gank target at this point, and closing it to this point of the game is very easy. She is quite inclined to CC abilities, especially when her Ultimate R is down to buy her some time for the CC to wear out. Even in the fights, she will have to be careful, otherwise she will get CC=d string and deleted. As for her game style, she will be focused on catching the side waves and not accompanying her team most of the time. This gives the enemy team a huge advantage over her team in terms of numbers and livelihoods."}

{"text": "Against mordekaiser, Ward your flanks like Mordekaiser can try to attack on the side to get on a high-value target with his Ultimate R. If Mordekaiser misses his E in a team fight, it would not be a bad time to focus it because he will be unable to shoot your team in when his E is on the cooldown. Avoid starting major goals like the Baron or a Dragon when Mordekaiser is nearby because he can take your Jungler into the Shadow Realm with his R that will make it take the risky goal."}

Once Leona has its basic elements, she will be able to protect both her team and herself at the same time."}

Twitch is the first level 2 power peak that it gets access to its s and can gank a track. Be ready for the level 2 gank and play cautiously in the first minutes. Once Twitch has obtained the hurricane of Runaan, its damage release will be fatal. It is very important that you do not let him lay down his damage by exploding it at the beginning of the fight."}
{"text": "Against naafiri, She is very good at roaming and ganking, so make sure to contact your team so they know when she's missing. Place the vision in her jungle entrances and the river.

Playing around her Packmates in the middle of the game and during team fights will be extremely beneficial as she will lack damage."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Level 11 will be another peak for Qiyana, this time in increasing damage and reduced cooling. It will be quite effective in objective combat. Its basic elements will be complete, and its ability to a squishy kick will be really high. It will allow it to do a lot during neutral combats, objectives, and group team combats. Its first capability will be maximized at level 9. This will result in a massive increase in damage and will immediately make it a high priority target for the enemy."}

This is because of his Passive and can quite easily lead to an outplay for the enemy, especially if the enemy gank target has built up a large minion wave.\n\nUsing his e carelessly, or very aggressively, can lead to him getting killed instantly.

Lee Sin is really good at removing or removing isolated targets. Make sure you group closer to your team to make it harder for him to take anyone alone."}
{"text": "Against amumu, Amumu\u2019s team fight presence is very strong. Do not group too closely as this will allow him to get a multiperson entangle with his Ultimate y.

{"text": "As amumu, Look for opportunities to land your s on the enemy bot laner that does not play parallel to their partner. This will allow your ADC and you to cut the target quickly. Using track brushes is essential to your success in this matchup. Make sure you do so and Control Ward at least one trackbrush that the enemy cannot access under any circumstances. Try to wander every time you remember. Your s is misleadingly long-range and can easily catch an out-of-guard mid-laner."}

It can now affect the fights easily with its Ultimate b and make sure that the enemies cannot fight him just and square during the fights. The first element will allow him to do a lot of damage to his opponents. It will also be beneficial when he throws his Ultimate b. His early play is good, but the result of the way really depends on the confrontation in which he is. It should have a fairly easy time in the way as long as he can poke enemies systematically."}

{"text": "As morgana, During this phase of the game, Morgana will have several elements that will allow him to protect his team. Combined with his E, his allies will be protected from the CC. A maximum of Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability quite frequently and flatten a lot of damage at the same time. It will be great during the battles piled up. She is excellent in the fights at the end of the game due to her overall utility and CC on her Q. That CC can easily be chained with her Ultimate R for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Quite vulnerable when his E is down.

{"text": "As shyvana, Very fast clear in the Jungle that allows her to invade and exit when she sees the enemy glove. This applies also to the laning because she can push the wave very quickly. After six, she becomes a monster. If she goes for the construction of the Jungle, she can practically carry a single blow if she manages to get enough dark harvest piles with her l. When she laning, she can use the shape to act as a front line for her team. Her ultimate displacement t can act as a peeling source for her squishy carts. It also allows her to land a multi-champion l, and treat a lot of damage with her a and k."}
{"text": "As camille, When no team fight happens, go in a side lane and look to divide the thrust. You are strong in a 1v1 and should be able to fight against anyone who tries to stop you. Every time you are divided push, look at what your team does and be ready to move from the side lane to help your team. Flank the enemy with your E to access key targets. Look for choices in the middle of the game with your E or Ultimate R. Catching someone when your team is nearby can easily lead to a murder and possibly a goal after it."}
{"text": "As olaf, Its objective control is quite powerful because its passive allows it to descend them very quickly. It should always try to get an objective if it can free a track after spoiling them. Level 6 is a massive peak of power for Olaf because it can now reach its target without being interrupted. If it manages to flank its enemies, the stationary carriers will be pretty condemned. Its first element will be a massive peak, increasing its overall damage in the game. It will strengthen its overall potential of damage."}
{"text": "As volibear, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate R is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As irelia, His E allows him to land a multi-man CC chain, which can be used as an extension of CC to targets already CC. He also allows him to Q to such targets without putting that ability on the cooldown. This ability can be the difference between a winning team fight, or a all-en-bout\u00e9, depending on his use. His Ultimate R does not only prevent the enemy from escaping quickly, but it also allows his teammates to land their own CC on the slow/trapped enemy team. He can act as a very effective initiation tool that gets a victory from his team."}

The extra ganking potential and the movement speed plus other stats from his Ultimate are really beneficial when it comes to trading.\n\nAatrox spikes when he gets his first item (as well as both component items). Respect his all in potential when he\u2019s completed the recipe as his damage output will heavily increase.\n\nAatrox is strong no matter what if you cannot dodge all instances of his Q.

{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah will want to delay a team's fight as long as possible while pushing you with its Q. Try and force a fight as soon as you spot it.

Every time it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get murders."}
{"text": "As vladimir, After level 6, Vladimir gets a peak of power with his e, so play a little more passively against him in this stage. The best opportunity to talk with Vladimir is when he used his l, because it's his only tool or survival in his kit, and he can inflict damage while using it with his I>E combo, so that he makes it even more vital for him.

{"text": "Against viego, Viego's skirmish power is quite high in the game of the time. Keep this in mind by trying to 1v1 him as he is pretty good early. Viego's level 6 is very good.

However, if he takes control of a weak champion, he may not be so great of a threat."}

Keep this in mind and beware of his empowered abilities."}
{"text": "As drmundo, His Ultimate R offers him a lot of extra protection, and the extra speed of movement that he provides will make it difficult for the enemy to go away from his ganks. Mundo can start to glove from level 3. Although his Q does not inflict much damage in early play, the slow that he provides is very convenient when it comes to gaunting his allies. Once Dr Mundo has finished his first article, his release of damage and overall tankness will increase. At this stage of the game, his ability to duel and the pressure to kill will be very high."}
{"text": "As brand, At level 9, Brand will put the final point in its ability W. This will allow it to constantly harass the enemy lantern and make them low enough that either they or their ADC can seek to kill. At this stage of the game, Brand would have picked up several items. Its release of damage and the pressure to kill will be incredibly high. Moreover, as the teams begin to regroup in the middle of the game, it will do a lot of damage AOE. At level 11, Brand will put a second point in its Ultimate R. It is a good peak of power for Brand because it will be able to inflict a considerable amount of bursting damage and allow him to make snowballs further."}
{"text": "As leesin, At level 6, Lee Sin will unblock his Ultimate k. His total pressure and kill increases sharply at this stage of the game. The first element will allow him to get a boost and increased survival during all the in. He will give him more chances of being killed during a duel."}

{"text": "As karthus, Getting your base elements will allow you to run down enemies and burn them to oblivion. Use your ultimate e at regular intervals to make sure you can help your teammates. Fight close to the bottlenecks to maximize the effectiveness of your combat team. Sometimes it would be wise to throw you into the enemy team, especially if the enemy front line decides to all-in-one without any follow-up. Another point in your ultimate e will allow you to destroy the opposition due to your constant burn damage. Use your e properly to make sure you win intertwined fights."}
{"text": "As maokai, It can use its Ultimate R quite frequently, which makes it difficult for the enemy team to do anything. Its tankness is out of the world during this part of the game.

This is due to the utility and chooses the potential integrated into its kit."}
{"text": "As xerath, Adding another point in his Ultimate 2 will allow Xerath to land more shots on targets. It will help him a lot when trying to finish off enemies who have escaped with poor health.\n\nAt level 9, Xerath's p will be maxed out. It will be obnoxiously easy for him to poke out the enemy laners now, mainly if he uses the lane brushes for the same purpose.\n\nXerath will have a maxed-out 2 when he hits level thirteen. This will deal with increased damage and allow Xerath to chain his p along with it. The result will be a massive chunk of damage."}
{"text": "As malphite, Try to abuse your range advantage to get an early health advance. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early to force them to lie down for the farm and XP. When you try to poke, target your abilities so they hit the minion wave and the enemy at the same time. Once they are level 6, they get stronger than you and it will be harder for you to run against them."}
{"text": "As varus, Stay away from his Q poke in this matchup. Use your mobility to avoid it when possible.\n\nHe will try to burst you down from a distance before closing in for the kill. Use the lane brushes to drop vision on Varus.\n\nSince he has in-built Grievous Wounds, you will want to make sure that you don't take extended fights.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and see if you can expose him to ganks. Shutting him down early is key to winning the game."}
{"text": "As jax, In addition, the CC aspect will allow him to score many peaks throughout the game. His mid-game is not as weak as his early game because he will have his basic elements and can use his Passive quite well. He will also be part of many objective fights, allowing him to land a multi-man E stun on the enemies. His E can also be used to make naughty games using the track brushes and lack of vision. Once he has two points in his Ultimate R, he will become powerful during team fights. This is because his survival will increase, which will increase the amount of constant damage inflicted by him with his self-attacks."}
{"text": "As akshan, At level 9, Akshan will max out his Q. This is really important for Akshan as maxing his Q offers him a lot of extra damage.\n\nWhen Akshan puts the second point in his Ultimate at level 11, he will find it quite easy to execute enemies.\n\nAt this stage of the game, teams will be grouping. Akshan\u2019s w will be really good at this stage of the game because he can bring back a recently deceased ally.\n"}
{"text": "As garen, As Garen has a lot of integrated support, make sure to get some form of healing reduction quickly to make you easier to kill them. Good times to trading vs Garen is when they used one of their damaging abilities as they won't have any damage to you trader. Try to follow Garen's Ultimate cooldown post 6. It's important to do so because you don't want to be caught by Garen's superior damage post 6. Keep harassing Garen with your abilities while pushing the minion wave. Try to target your abilities so they hit Garen and the minion wave at the same time."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, When he hits level 6, his kill pressure in the lane increases. Expect him to look for aggressive plays with his Ultimate R frequently.\n\nHis next major power spike is at level 11 when he puts the second point in his Ultimate R.\n\nAfter he has completed his first component item, Malzahar\u2019s damage in the lane will increase a lot.

{"text": "Against gragas, Like most champions, Gragas points to level 6 again as his Ultimate R is a really good tool when it comes to glove. If he expects to gank the extended tracks every time he's level 6. Always keep an eye on what he's buying items. Gragas can go tank or build a lot of AP. If it's about AP, respect his damage output. Every time Gragas has his E up, it's a bigger threat and you need to position and play safely. If he uses his E and he's missing, you can look to turn the exchange."}
{"text": "Against tristana, If Tristana uses her W aggressively, overturned her or CC she is unable to reposition herself and clean up the fight. Bringing her down early will make it really difficult for her team to win the fight. In the middle of the match, if Tristana is in advance, avoid walking too far if you are alone. She has a lot of all-in-one and choose thanks to her W and E. Stay at an appropriate distance from her so she can't easily get you off. Tristana has a lot to peel with her W and Ultimate R. To facilitate the fight, try to play around her Ultimate R or try to flank her in team fights. This will make her more difficult kite/escape from the fight."}
{"text": "Against orianna, Avoid fighting around goals, near Tours and in the jungle as it can allow Orianna to get a multi-person Ultimate d and win the team fight. Try to divide as much as possible (stand away from each other) so Orianna is not allowed to land a good Ultimate d. If Orianna has a strong front line, keep an eye on their positioning especially if she has her Ball D on them. If the enemy front line runs towards you, turn off as quickly as you can so that they are not able to set up its Ultimate d."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level sixteen will further reduce the cooldown of his Ultimate t and increase the damage of his mushrooms. Enemies will have a hard time traversing choke points now.\n\nHe will have a lot of ability Haste now, which means he can drop a lot more mushrooms around the map. The enemies will have to invest heavily in vision to keep themselves safe.\n\nHe will complete his build during this phase of the game, which will allow him to one-shot squishy targets. His t blind should come in handy during this phase of the game as well."}
{"text": "As katarina, Play safe in the early game. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you will struggle to lane and you will delay your first major power spike. \n\nKatarina is a strong roaming champion.

They offer a lot of extra pressure in lane and will often fall in ideal places to go for favourable trades."}
{"text": "As ornn, You will want to stay with your ADC and your team as much as you can. In addition, neutral objective fights will be your bread and butter. Ward up correctly and work with your Jungler to secure the choices as much as possible. Warding will allow you to make several Ultimate R games. After entering with your Q > E combo, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in team fights."}
{"text": "Against brand, Try to stay behind the minion wave but not in it. This will force Brand to choose between harassing you with his W or pushing the wave. It's also a good place to stand that the minions will block his Q. Don't let Brand harass you for free. Try to stand behind and out of reach of him so that he is unable to attack you and harass you with his W. Make sure you will stay healthy otherwise you will never be able to fight him. A good time to fight Brand is when he comes out of mana or has a ability on cooldown. This will make the trade much better for you because he won't be able to flatten much damage (or perhaps stunned if his Q is on cooldown) as he has 1 less ability to use it."}
{"text": "As vayne, Her first ability will be maxed out at level nine. From this point, she will start hitting like a truck as her e will be up very quickly in the game.\n\nGetting two points in her Ultimate n will cause her to spike again.

Do not fight in the jungle or around goals when Rakan has his Ultimate Rup that your team will be grouped closer. Remember, being slightly separated will make it harder for him to get a multi-person Ultimate R. Bursting Rakan down as soon as he engages is very favorable. As soon as he activates his Ultimate R, try CC him and bring him down so he is unable to get a good engagement."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, You will want to target Cassiopeia with your r when possible.

This will make her waste mana and will let you get the upper hand.\n\nOnce Cassiopeia gets her Ultimate R, you will want to be very careful when all-in'ing her. Make sure you look away from her the moment your Ultimate R animation ends.\n\nKeep the wave slightly on your side of the lane.

{"text": "As maokai, Once Maokai gets his ultimate R maxid, the enemy will not have a perfect time in the game. Maokai's team will quickly capitalize on his CC, however. His tankness is really high during the end of the game. His passive will not let him die while he plunges the enemy backline and inflicts damage on him. He is decent during late fighting like his W, and Q can easily CC a high priority target and prevent them from joining the fights. This gives his allies time to damage the other enemies or collapse on target CC'd."}

It is important that you do not fall behind in CS and XP by staying in the middle when there are many other champions there."}
{"text": "As jinx, Jinx's level 6 is an important peak of power since it can allow it to kill puffs on the other side of the map. It is also a good finishing capacity after a prolonged skirmish where enemies escape with little or no HP. The first element will give a boost to Jinx's skirmishing potential. It will allow it to flatten much more damage during the skirmishes. It excels by using its Q rockets in the team fighting set up as long as someone peels for it. Additional points in its Q will allow it to flatten more damage and help it with its late scale. Combined with its basic elements, the correct use of this ability will make the difference between a great and a bad Jinx."}

It will increase his damage output massively as well.\n\nAt level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate R. This will increase both his tankiness and kill pressure at the same time. His Passive will help him a lot when it comes to diving into the enemy backline and surviving.        "}
{"text": "As velkoz, At level 16, Vel'Koz will have his Ultimate R maxed out. This means that he can now deal tons of damage from far away even if he gets one stack of his Passive on his enemy.\n\nHis damage output will be really high due to the number of items he possesses at that point in the game. He should focus on using the fog of war to poke out enemies first.\n\nVel'Koz will be extremely good in team fights, especially fights where he is playing around choke points. This means that he can apply his Passive stacks on multiple enemies, making it easier for him to kill a bunch of enemies together."}
{"text": "As chogath, It is a good peak of power for him because it will allow him to exchange more effectively with the enemy lantern. When he puts 2 points in his Ultimate t at level 11, his death pressure increases considerably as his Ultimate t will allow him to execute a higher health enemy. In the middle of the match, Cho=gath should have used his Ultimate t on the minions or enemy champions. He will be stronger and stronger the things he consumes."}

Level 2 in the bottom lane is the first minion wave followed by the next 3 melee minions.\n\nYour goal during the laning phase is so to look for kills and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to gain a lead.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As viego, Viego can steal the life of his enemies that can allow him to escape danger. As it becomes unstoppable, it can allow him to avoid incoming damage. Viego is a fun and rewarding champion to play thanks to his Passive and his Ultimate R. Expect to hang on to him quite quickly. Viego has a high skill ceiling. This means more effort than you put in him, the better you will be on him."}
{"text": "Against diana, Diana's core power peak is once she reaches level 6 because she will have control of the crowd on her Ultimate R. At that time, she will look to gank and continue to gank whenever it is available. After Diana has finished her first article, her potential for scarring and damage will increase sharply. She will be a real threat at this stage of the game. The more she kills she gets stronger. Try and counter gank as she has nothing to offer once she blows her Ultimate R or Q."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Kassadin is weak early on as he can't get too close to his opponents to burst them down. This is mainly because of a lack of mobility and items until he hits level 6. To compensate, he should play safely and rely on proper vision setup to not die often.\n\nAt level 6, Kassadin will unlock his Ultimate k. That is his first significant power spike as he can now dash to or away from an enemy depending on the given situation. As the game progresses, this ability will play a pivotal role in Kassadin's success.\n\nOnce Kassadin gets his first item, he should deal a lot of burst damage to his enemies. Bonus points if he can shove his wave in and look for kills on other lanes. It will give him a considerable boost.        "}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, In the team fights, Jarvan IV will seek to lock as many champions as he can with his Ultimate m. Make sure you are grouped together as a team but not regrouped so closely together that he can lock everyone in his Cataclysm m. Jarvan gameplay is not very creative when it comes to fighting. Warding base areas like bushes or choking points will probably spot Jarvan before he has the chance to flank or gank. If you can interrupt Jarvan in his combo at the beginning of the fight, it will be very difficult for him to get his Ultimate m or escape after committing. As soon as he runs towards you, either disengage or lock him up with CC."}
{"text": "As varus, Very immobile and can be easily killed if crowd control is layered on him. All-in Supports hiding in a lane brush while waiting for him will naturally zone him off the minion wave.\n\nExtremely vulnerable while his Ultimate R is down. He can be flanked with ease as well and assassin\u2019s can easily get rid of him if his team forgets to peel for him.\n\nImproper usage of his E can lead to lost team fights. In lane, using his E improperly will allow any form of enchanter and mage Support to walk up to him and poke him down with ease. "}
{"text": "As vex, At level 14, Vex will finish upgrading her second ability. Again, her damage output and overall threat will increase.\n\nPretty much every champion spikes at level 16 when they put the 3rd point in their Ultimate R.\n\nTeams will be grouping in the late game. Vex is good in team fights, so she should do pretty well in late game team fights. \n"}
{"text": "As shaco, Once you get some items, it's time to invade the enemy Jungle with your allies. See if you can get some choices here and there. When you take neutral, objective fights, make sure you place your x boxes near the Jungle entrances and one in the pit. This way, no one can try a surprise flight. Your Ultimate I will be extremely useful during team fights. Just make sure that you use it to delimit the enemy rear line of the front line. This way, you will gain a massive advantage during team fights."}
{"text": "Against katarina, When purchasing this item, Katarina will force more skirmishes and trades. Once Katarina reaches level 6, her death pressure will intensify because her Ultimate R is an excellent tool and inflicts tons of damage. Respect her all-in once she reaches level 6. Katarina is really good in team fights. Make sure to lock her up with CC as soon as she engages so she can't get a good Ultimate R Off."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton relies heavily on his cooldowns to get an advance. Whenever his abilities are down, he is not really able to trade as much. Similarly, Renekton has to play around his Fury bar to get the most damage during a trade. If he fights without Fury or uses the wrong self-sustaining ability, he can cost him the trade. Avoid using your self-sustaining e if possible. Renekton falls into the later stages of the game as he no longer has his early play forces when the game goes further. Moreover, he is really bad in the later stages of the game if he has not got an early lead."}
{"text": "As akshan, At level 9, Akshan will maximize his Q. It's really important for Akshan as maxing his Q offers him a lot of extra damage. When Akshan puts the second point in his Ultimate at level 11, he will find it pretty easy to execute enemies. At this stage of the game, the teams will be grouped. Akshans w will be really good at this stage of the game because he can bring back a recently deceased ally."}
{"text": "As chogath, At level 9, Cho\u2019Gath will max out his s. This is a good power spike for him as it will allow him to trade more effectively with the enemy laner.\n\nWhen he puts 2 points in his Ultimate t at level 11, his kill pressure intensifies dramatically as his Ultimate t will allow him to execute an enemy from higher health.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Cho\u2019gath should\u2019ve used his Ultimate t on minions or enemy champions. He will be stronger and stronger the more things he consumes."}
{"text": "As zoe, Zoe should have a lot of articles now, which means that squishies at one stroke is now available on the menu. She just needs to hit one of them with her E. Due to the low cooling on her abilities, she will systematically land poke on her enemies. Her empowered self-attacks will hit like a truck. She will not be too hot on level 16 because it will just reduce the cooling of the Ultimate R and do nothing powerful. That means she will be able to kill people quickly, however."}
{"text": "As kayn, When he is against ranged champions, or if the enemy freezes near their tower, it will be pretty hard for Kayn to be helpful because they may zone him away from CS and XP.\n\nKayn is high risk and high reward. If he doesn\u2019t get an early lead, he may struggle to be helpful in the later stages of the game.\n\nIn team fights, it might be hard for him to kill anyone if they have CC, long-ranged poke, or disengage tools. He has the same problem as a lot of assassins."}
{"text": "As draven, Keep the wave closer to your side of the card in the game very early. It will protect you from the ganks and those who zone you away from the farm. Do not trade cars with Draven. It will win every fight early. Play safely early! Draven is very strong at levels 1, 2 and 3. Play safely early. Your goal in this matchup will just hit him early."}
{"text": "As velkoz, His poke damage is quite high and obnoxious for the enemy team to deal with. This poke can build up over time and makes it so that the enemy laner is forced to play in the cover of their minion wave.\n\nHis wave clearing potential is very high due to his W and Q. This allows him to clear up the waves pretty quickly and get lane priority, which allows him to help his team secure objectives.\n\nExcels in fights taking place in chokepoints and close quarters as it allows him to quickly stack up his Passive. This combined with his Ultimate R can easily allow him to destroy the enemy team."}
{"text": "As ryze, Ryze's weakness is quite amazing during the start of the game, so he should make sure he plays safely and carefully around. The main objective is to increase first. His level six will not be very impacted during this phase of the game because he has a long cooldown, and roaming during this phase would be a problem. The first element will allow him to inflict a lot of damage to his enemies and spam his abilities frequently. Nevertheless, he should not play too aggressively and simply rely on the scale."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Disengagement is Master Yi's worst nightmare. As soon as he activates his Ultimate r and runs to your team, disengagement so that he can not resume the fight. When he is weak, make sure to get over it even if Master Yi is not there. If he takes free and easy blows, he will make heavy snowballs and take over from the next team fight. Try to wait for Master Yi to use his e before locking him up with CC. As he can use his e to avoid skill blows and CC if time is correct, it is best to wait for him to use this ability before trying to kill him."}
{"text": "As tristana, Her attack range will be pretty high during this phase of the game. It will let her dish out a lot of damage while staying safe from CC.\n\nAnother point in her Ultimate R will allow her to deal more damage and bolster the finishing move. It will be on a low cooldown which means that she can use it quite frequently.\n\nThis stage of the game is make or break for Trist. She can be strong, but if she isn't ahead, she will be icnredibly weak."}
{"text": "As aphelios, Aphelios\u2019s late game is also strong. Although while you\u2019re good in the late game, it is important that you do not over aggres as Aphelios is very squishy.\n\nIn the late game, Aphelios will be full build or nearing completion of his build. He will be able to dish out a lot of damage in late game team fights.\n\nAphelios is a strong team fighting champion. He should group with his team and play as 5. He will be able to melt tanks at this stage of the game, as long as he watches his positioning and doesn\u2019t get caught out."}
{"text": "Against rumble, When Rumble\u2019s r is down, his damage output will be heavily reduced. Wait for him to use his r on the jungle camp before initiating a skirmish with him.\n\nRumble has good objective control early. Try and secure the objectives before he has an opportunity to take them on his own.\n\nWhen fighting Rumble in a 1v1, make sure you dodge his e\u2019s as the slow and damage they deal can be crippling and cost you the fight."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 11 is not a massive spike like other Junglers. It gives only a minor increase in the damage and no utility, unlike other Junglers. That being said, the lower cooldown certainly helps.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This means he can deal a massive amount of burst damage to any enemy he gets too close to.\n\nPantheon is quite potent during the mid-game. This is because he can dish out a lot of damage in a short time and can secure picks all around the map.         "}
{"text": "As pyke, You will be really powerful during this phase of the game. Look to assassinate the enemy backline whenever you get the chance and do so from the fog of war.\n\nYou will want to prioritize tenacity if the enemy has a lot of CC in their team. This will help you escape from unfavorable situations with ease.\n\nThe enemy Support will be pretty busy warding during this phase of the game. You may want to set some death brushes and see if you can get some free kills."}
{"text": "As malphite, Can absorb a lot of damage for his team with his Passive. This allows him to be a frontline for his team while also being able to escape from death when he goes in with his Ultimate h.\n\nPost-six, he can set up multiple ganks for both his lane as well as other lanes with his Ultimate h. This is highly beneficial if the lane he is ganking has some form of CC built in their kit.\n\nHe is the bane of all immobile carries, especially the ranged immobile ones. He can quite easily get on top of them and prevent them from doing anything in a fight. If Malphite goes AP, there won\u2019t be an enemy carry for most part of the game."}
{"text": "As missfortune, This champion is quite motionless and is subject to CC. If they get caught by any CC, they will probably die. In particular, when she channels her Ultimate e she is vulnerable. Unlike many ADCs, she does not have a dash or escape ability. This can be a huge problem for her throughout the game. Miss Fortune is not very good in 1v1s and her outplay potential is not the best. Due to her Passive, she is rather weak in 1v1s unless she is in advance or can get a very good Ultimate e Off."}
{"text": "As xerath, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As chogath, His Ultimate T can help him execute enemies, so that a large number of Cho-Gaths will be able to farm up to 6. Cho-Gath has good objective control thanks to his Ultimate T. Get each Drake with the help of your team. It is weak in 1v1=S early especially if he is taken out without his m to an enemy invasion."}
{"text": "As soraka, Soraka is good during the team fights because of her W, Q and E. She will have to look at the flanks, however, as the assassins will certainly try to kill her. A maximum of Ultimate R will make sure she can use the ability in a given team fight. Combined with her haste ability, she will be able to heal her team a lot. Her W will be maximized and will have a very low cooling. This means she will heal her teammates frequently and for massive amounts as long as she has enough health or mana to do so."}
{"text": "As kennen, Group with your team and don't leave them. If you start to divide the thrust, the enemy will force a fight and kill your team while you're gone. Delay the team's fights while you wait for your Ultimate to come back to me. Do not fight the team unless your Ultimate m is up. Also, waiting for your Zhonyas Hurglass to arrive would also be beneficial. If the enemy has a lot of disengagement or poke, continue flancing in the team fights to make sure you get up to the enemy before they are able to disengage or shoot you down."}
{"text": "As talon, Talon has the highest amount of first bloods in the game. His early kill pressure is insane!\n\nTalon has great roaming potential thanks to his E. This allows him to jump over walls and move around the map quickly.\n\nIn the later parts of the game, Talon can pick up extra kills on enemies who are walking around the map alone. As he deals a lot of burst damage, he can kill them quickly before running to safety."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie is a team fighting champion thanks to the AOE on Tibbers R. As teams will start to group during the mid-game, it is plausible that she can land a multi-person stun with him.\n\nWhen she has 2 points in her Ultimate R, she will be able to look for more aggressive plays around the map. She can also use her Flash to get picks too. She will put the second point in her Ultimate R at level 11.\n\nAnnie\u2019s E will be on a shorter cooldown during the mid-game. This is good for her and her ADC as she will be able to protect them more frequently in mid-game team fights."}
{"text": "As veigar, Very immobile and is extremely vulnerable to crowd control. He has a weak early game as well, so he can easily be abused and killed with a few ganks.\n\nHis n is on a really long cooldown, and it is his only form of self-peel. Once it is down, he can be easily all-in\u2019d and killed with crowd control.\n\nHe will take a lot of time to come online if he happens to get killed a few times during the early game. He isn\u2019t going to be very effective if the game goes on for too long so try to shut him down early and end the game quickly."}
{"text": "As karthus, Try to go for short burst trades with your 1 in the lane. The goal is to ensure that the enemy can't all-in you during the laning phase. Ward around and just aim to play safely.\n\nOnce you get your first item component, you should spam your abilities more frequently in the lane. It will help you use your n combined with your 1 to go for regular trades with the enemy. You still need to play safely, though.\n\nOn getting your Ultimate e, you should be able to finish off kills in other lanes. Make sure that you show up to neutral, objective fights as well since your e will be really effective in those situations.        "}
{"text": "Against jhin, Be careful when Jhin runs on you with his 4th shot during team fights. In the middle of the game at the end, this car can cause a lot of damage. Wait for Jhin's team, or when he's isolated to try to take it. He doesn't have an escape or dash, and he's very squishy too, he should be pretty easy to kill. If Jhin uses his Ultimate R in a team fight, he's unable to reposition quickly. If you're on the flank, try to get him down while he's focusing on his shots."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Trendamere is good at level 6 as its Ultimate e offers it additional protection in the skirmishes. It is a good split pusher in the middle and end of the game. Make sure someone defies his thrust throughout all the stages of the game. At level 9, Trendamere would have maximized his first ability. His power of skirmishes at this stage will be much stronger and it will be deadly to fight him alone."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Watch out for a potential Flash engage by Pantheon. In team fights, don\u2019t stand too far forward in case he tries to make a play.\n\nWard your flanks! Pantheon may try to attack you from the side and get on to your carries when his Ultimate R is on cooldown. \n\nGood times to fight is when Pantheon is split pushing. Forcing a fight when he is on the opposite side of the map could be a good idea as it will take him some time to get into the fight even with his Ultimate R. "}
{"text": "As zac, Zac has great all-in potential throughout the laning phase. As soon as the enemy moves forward or overextends, he can look to play aggressive.\n\nHis Passive and Ultimate R can allow him to singlehandedly take a group of enemies out of a major team fight by simply zoning them away. He can also deal a lot of damage to the enemy backline if they ignore Zac.\n\nZac has good sustain in lane, thanks to his blobs. The additional health and sustain lets him survive harder matchups and out heal the enemy."}
{"text": "As rumble, His lack of mobility makes him an easy target against murderers and strong champions of skirmishes. Rumble's efficiency is greatly diminished when his passive is not half filled. In some matches, he will be invaded again and again because of his weak game very early. When in these matches, you have to sacrifice a lot to stay alive."}
{"text": "Against garen, Garen\u2019s kill pressure in the early game can be difficult to handle if you\u2019re playing as a tank. Respect his all-in and try and avoid trading with him unless his Q is down. \n \nAt level 6, Garen will gain access to his Ultimate R which can be used to execute enemies. Do not fight him when low, and definitely recall if you\u2019re below 50% health as he might look for a trade. It\u2019s better to be safe rather than try and fight and give him a kill.\n \nOnce Garen has completed his first item, he will be more obnoxious and looking to trade more and more. Keep this in mind and do not commit to fights with him alone. "}
{"text": "Against hwei, Stay as far away as possible, and away from the walls so it gives you more time to react to its abilities. Abusive of its still nature by forcing the enemy duo of the lower track to stretch. Your Jungler can then gank you while they are pushed in. Follow its E cooldown and mana costs. If it is weak on mana or if this ability is on cooldown, try to play aggressively."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong will be unable to team fight if you can poke him down before he gets the chance to engage. Delay a team fight while you poke him down as much as possible.\n\nDo not fight inside the jungle or around objectives. You will usually be bunched up together which will allow Wukong to get a great Ultimate n off.\n\nWard your flanks as Wukong will often try to flank from the side to get on to your team. Once you\u2019ve spotted him, poke him down or disengage if necessary."}
{"text": "As karma, It can use its Q both poke and clear wave, which allows it to obtain the priority of the track, and its Jungler can safely invade the enemy accordingly. The first component offers a lot of poke from the end of Karma because it increases the damage of its Q and allows it to use it frequently because it will have more mana to use. Level 6 is not a huge peak, but it certainly increases the amount of damage to the poke that it can do with its abilities. Its Qualified Q is a force to count with once it touches level 6. The use of the track brushes will provide an additional layer of safety to Karma while ensuring that the enemy lantern has a horrible time in the track."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Drive around the map and look for peaks with your b. If you can catch someone, call for a nearby goal and abuse their timer of death. Place the vision around the medium track and never you and your ADC are playing. This will increase your chances of surviving an all-in. Set up ambushes on the enemy as they move around the map."}
{"text": "As illaoi, During the middle of the game, push and apply pressure on the edges of the map while your team exerts pressure elsewhere. Illaoi is very strong in team fighting, so it is recommended that you find opportunities to group with your team. In particular, you are good around the goals and in the jungle."}
{"text": "Against kennen, Kennen is really good in team fights. Avoid fighting in the Dragon or Baron pit as it will allow him to get a good Ultimate m off. Kennen is inclined to peel and disengage. Try to disengage as soon as you see him running towards you. In addition, make sure you have the vision on your side in case he tries to flanculate. Try to harass and poke Kennen as much as you can before a team fight occurs."}
{"text": "As graves, You should be able to cut off the enemy's escape with your e and finish them with your automatic attacks and e. You will have your basic items now, which will make it really easy to break the enemies. You can work with your Jungler to invade and kill targets that occur for you. The setting up of death brushes should allow you to target targets at a single shot that wanders without goal. During the fighting, stay close to your front line and prepare for e in and the enemy when you have a chance."}
{"text": "As sion, Your goal in the early game is to play safe, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy laner. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online.\n\nOnce you have quite a few levels under your belt, you should look for short favourable trades. As you\u2019re not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in lane."}
{"text": "As xerath, Xerath's damage will skyrocket during this stage of the game. This is quite helpful for him as it allows him to carry his team later on during the game. His pick potential is quite massive as well.\n\nOnce Xerath gets his Ultimate 2 maxed out, he will be able to land even more shots on unsuspecting enemies. Xerath will need to ensure that he stays in a safe position while doing so.\n\nXerath's poke is quite unparalleled during major team fights. He will have a great time using the fog of war and range advantage to one-shot squishies."}
{"text": "As irelia, His E allows him to land a multi-man CC chain, which can be used as an extension of CC to targets already CC. He also allows him to Q to such targets without putting that ability on the cooldown. This ability can be the difference between a winning team fight, or a all-en-bout\u00e9, depending on his use. His Ultimate R does not only prevent the enemy from escaping quickly, but it also allows his teammates to land their own CC on the slow/trapped enemy team. He can act as a very effective initiation tool that gets a victory from his team."}
{"text": "As fiora, Wait for her to use her W up before looking for an all-in. Else, she might just CC you and kill you.\n\nA good time to look for an all-in will be when her dash is down.

He will want to let the wave push towards him during level 1 to maximize the strength of his level 2.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike for Talon as it increases his overall burst damage. It also lets him roam around a lot and kill enemies in the side lane without any warning.\n\nThe first item component should allow him to dish out a lot of damage in the lane or when he is roaming.

Your wave is incredibly strong and you can erase the waves quickly. You can then use your lane priority to wander with ease."}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu will have multiple items during the mid-game. Depending on his build, he will either deal a lot of damage in team fights, or be incredibly tanky and hard to kill.\n\nAt level 11, Amumu will have 2 points in his Ultimate y. This means his Ultimate y will be on a shorter cooldown which can help him in team fights and help his team get picks.\n\nTeams start to group during the mid-game, and as Amumu is a team fighting champion, he is pretty good during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As sett, Once Sett gets 3 points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to run his enemies down with ease and will be able to use the ability quite frequently. This allows him to make quick work of tanks.\n\nSett is decent during the latter parts of the game. He can dish out a ton of damage while simultaneously peeling for his team and acting as a worthy front liner.\n\nSett's ability to get picks during the late game is phenomenal. He excels at fights that occur near chokepoints, making it really hard for the enemies to try and get neutral objectives."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Has to powerfarm early game and hence has no impact unless the enemy overextends or overstays. He will mainly focus on cleaning up during the early game.\n\nHis e can easily be interrupted by any form of hard CC.

Very susceptible to CC, so if the enemy saves their CC for him, he will die."}

It will be really good for her as she will deal damage and be able to keep her allies alive for a lot longer.\n\n2 points in her Ultimate R at level 11 offers her extra pick potential at this stage of the game. As teams start to group up in the mid-game, she will be quite strong.\n\nPutting an additional point in her Ultimate R is great for Renata as teams start grouping during the mid-game. The reduced cooldown on this ability enables her to go for more picks in fights.\n"}
{"text": "Against maokai, Avoid fighting in the jungle as that will allow Maokai to get a good Ultimate R off. Additionally, avoid fighting around neutral objectives like the Dragon or Baron too.\n\nWhen sieging, make sure no one on your team is too far forward as Maokai can isolate them and catch them out of position with his W. \n\nAs it might be hard for Maokai to team fight, he may try to flank from the side to make it easier to get on to the enemy. He may also use his Ultimate R from the side to CC your whole team. Ward the flanks so you can spot him before he initiates."}

If you push the post 6, you could find yourself **Ulting** the enemy in their turn, and you will have to withdraw. **Ulting** can screw you in many cases.

Just make sure that you don't misposition and get caught out while doing so, though.\n\nYou may work with your team to get picks in the enemy Jungle, but you should try your best to be in a side lane and chase down careless enemies who decide to farm the sidewave.\n\nGetting a defensive item should help you increase your survivability against burst damage and assassination attempts. Use your Ultimate n invisibility wisely as well since it can bamboozle enemies quite easily if used properly."}
{"text": "As graves, Graves deals a lot of damage to any target during this phase due to his Passive and items. It is a significant power spike for him, which can very well allow him to single-handedly carry a game.\n\nOnce he gets three points in his Ultimate t, no low health enemy on the map will be safe. He can just dash in, auto an enemy twice, and then use his Ultimate t to finish them off.\n\nAt level 13, Graves will be able to deal a lot of burst damage and play circles around the enemy due to his maxed out l and e. In addition, it will give him an excellent dueling advantage."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius starts to fall off in the late game, but he is still powerful. He falls off as other champions start getting items that counter him, and many champions will be tankier, which makes it harder for him to kill them.\n\nAt level 16, Darius\u2019s Ultimate e will be an essential tool in team fights. As it can deal a considerable amount of damage and as it is an execute- he will be able to take down targets and use the reset to kill multiple targets.\n\nBy this stage of the game, Darius should be near max build. As he builds items that enhance his damage and offer him protection, he will be relatively tanky and challenging to take down."}
{"text": "As viktor, His early play is terrible, and he should avoid fighting for longer periods of time during this game phase. Focus on the scale. Level six is a decent power peak because it allows Viktor to develop a decent amount of pressure to kill in the way. It will allow him to impact the fights quite easily as well. The first element will give him both mana and the potential for wave compensation."}
{"text": "As lux, Once it has several objects, it will crush the enemies to the left, right and center. All it has to do is to sit in the fog of the war and wait for an unsuspecting enemy to enter on it. At level 16, Lux goes mega-spike. This is due to its Ultimate n being reclassified to level three. It will now blow up the enemies with the Ultimate n alone, and the cooling of capacity will be negligible. Its g will be on a very low cooling now, and the Jungle will be its playground."}
{"text": "Against corki, Do not look to fight inside the jungle when Corki has his Passive as his b will deal tons of damage if he can get use it on the whole team. Fight in areas that are in the open as it makes it easier to dodge the b.\n \nWhen starting a team fight, you need to engage quickly. Corki will look to delay a team fight and poke with his b and e. If you engage and fight quickly, he will not have time to poke you down.\n \nTry to collapse on Corki when he is in the mid-lane with his Support during the mid-game. This will help your team secure objectives like the Baron. Lock him down with CC and attack from Fog of War."}
{"text": "As annie, In the mid-game, she is powerful whenever her Ultimate R is up. Roaming to over-extended enemy lanes and lane ganking pushed up ally lanes should give her a massive lead.\n\nVery high pick potential due to her Passive and Ultimate R. After shoving the wave, she should be aiming to roam around with her Jungler and help the team.\n\nOnce she gets her core items, she can pretty much burst down any enemy squishy who doesn't have any form of Magic Resistance in their kit. Purchasing a Sweeper and playing around with vision will give her a boost in power."}
{"text": "As jinx, It will execute several targets with its Ultimate R once it is fully maximized. This will help it maintain its distance and process Passive. At level 13, Jinx will have 2 of its maximized capabilities. This will increase its overall damage and self-peel potential in the game. Jinx is huge during the fights at the end of the match if she has her items. Her Passive will leave her kite once proc'd, and she will be able to use her range advantage to melt enemy teams."}
{"text": "As shaco, Focus on farming early. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.\n\nHowever, if you do find a ganking or counter-ganking opportunity nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to take it.\n\nIf they invade you early, just back off; you do not win early skirmishes with them.\n\nTry to secure those major objectives when you can, as you have decent objective control. You could gank bot, then take Drake afterwards."}
{"text": "As viktor, If your allies move on your track after destroying their turn, rotate and move around the map to continue growing and winning XP and gold. Use your capabilities to quickly clear the minion waves so your team can besiege/prevent an enemy team seat. If you can land poke while also pushing the minion wave, you can look for a favorable trade. By sitting Baron or Dragon, or whenever you push the enemy under their turn, look for a peak with your abilities. If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you will be able to take the goal for free."}
{"text": "As malzahar, A fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow Malzahar to dish out hefty amounts of damage. Enchanters and squishy targets will have a hard time.\n\nHe is solid during late-game fights as his Q and Ultimate R will hit like a truck now. He will need to check the enemy inventory for a QSS before he decides to all-in a champion, though.\n\nHis Q and E will be maxed out and will be doing many consistent DPS during this phase of the game. The Q will let him keep the wave in check as well."}
{"text": "As velkoz, His level six is a massive power spike as he can now use his Passive to the utmost potential. He will just have to ensure that he doesn't root himself in a position where an enemy can flank him.\n\nHis first item component will be beneficial as it will allow him to use his W frequently to wave clear. This will allow him to prevent the enemy laner from roaming freely.\n\nBefore level six, Vel'Koz should stick to keeping the wave on his side of the tower due to his squishiness. His combo is relatively ineffective, too, without his Ultimate R.        "}
{"text": "As twitch, Extremely squishy and can be easily killed if he is CC\u2019d. His positioning matters in team fights as well, otherwise, he can get flanked by enemy assassins and get instantly deleted.\n\nWithout his Ultimate c or s, his ability to dominate a team fight drastically decreases. Fighting him during this stage will give the enemy team a much greater chance of winning.\n\nPractically gets countered by a Control Ward as it forces him to reroute. This is because of the short-ranged nature of his auto-attacks, which makes him get detected quite easily."}
{"text": "As quinn, Unfortunately, Quinn doesn\u2019t exactly spike at level 11 like a lot of other champions.\n\nAt level 9, Quinn will max out her first ability. This is a significant spike for her as this abilities damage output will be much higher and she will be a lot stronger.\n\nQuinn is quite strong during the mid-game. She will be able to blow up overextended enemies who are walking around Summoners Rift alone.\n"}
{"text": "As zilean, This is a farming matchup. Focus on farming and just harassing with your abilities.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave at all times. They will be trying to push, and by standing out of the wave, you force them to choose between using mana on the wave or you.\n\nInvesting in early boots can help you dodge their skill shots and make the laning phase less stressful.\n\nBe prepared to sacrifice CS for XP and health. Recall when you\u2019re low so you don\u2019t fall behind due to poke.\n"}
{"text": "As gnar, This is the point of the game where the grouped fights become common. This means that Gnar can now decimate the enemy team with the appropriate use of his Ultimate R. At level eleven, he will have two points in his Ultimate R. This is really good because it increases the overall damage inflicted by the ability and reduces the overall cooling. His Q is his main poke tool in the way and in the game. He will be maximized to the new level, ensuring that he can harass the enemies tirelessly and force them to remember abruptly."}
{"text": "As skarner, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game. Getting them and securing the Dragon Soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nLook for picks with your team. If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "As ekko, At level 16, Ekkos Ultimate R will do a lot of damage and will be on a really short refreshment. He can look for incredibly aggressive games every time he's up. Several articles offer him low refreshments and lots of brilliant damage. Do not be afraid to go for the games. The teams will group closely in the end of the game. It's good for Ekko because it can allow him to get a multi-person W out and CC all the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against rengar, Rengar will try to power farm early so he can get his R and start ganking more effectively. Try to delay this power spike by invading him and stealing away his camps.\n\nTry to place vision inside Rengars jungle so you know where he is at all times. If you spot him on the top side (pre-level 6), try to invade the bottom side jungle and take his camps. Alternatively, you can gank the bottom lane.\n\nIt isn\u2019t uncommon for Rengar to repeatedly gank a lane over and over again. If he has just ganked your lane, expect him to return shortly afterwards."}
{"text": "As lulu, Level 3 is a massive power spike as Lulu gets access to all her abilities. She can either go for full damage all-ins on the enemy or work on defending her ADC as needed.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike. She will now annoy the enemy by completely negating assassination and burst down attempts from the enemy's end.\n\nThe first item component will surely help Lulu out a lot in the lane. She can spam her abilities frequently due to the increased mana regeneration while simultaneously decreasing the cooldowns of her spells.        "}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Roam around the map and look for picks with your b. If you can catch someone, call for a nearby objective and abuse their death timer.\n\nPlace vision around the mid lane and where ever you and your ADC are currently playing.

In particular, you could look to catch out the enemy Support when they go to ward"}
{"text": "As velkoz, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As jinx, Jinx's level 6 is a significant power spike as it can allow her to snipe kills from the other side of the map. It is also a good finishing ability after an extended skirmish where the enemies escape with little to no HP.\n\nThe first item component will give a boost to Jinx's skirmishing potential. It will allow her to dish out a lot more damage during skirmishes. She excels when using her Q rockets in clumped team fights as long as someone is peeling for her.\n\nAdditional points in her Q will allow her to dish out more damage and help her with her late-game scaling. Combined with her core items, the correct usage of this ability will differentiate between a great and a bad Jinx."}

{"text": "Against nidalee, Nidalee will be strong enough once she has a few points in her s. Her Spears deal a lot of damage, so make sure to avoid them. Nidalee doesn't peak as much on level 6 as other champions she already has her Ultimate r at level 1. Once she's finished her Jungling element, her damage exit will be very good. Avoid fighting her unless you can catch her out of her position or if you're stronger than her."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan doesn\u2019t do too well into ranged matchups and champs with easy to land CC as he will be unable to use his E aggressively.\n\nHis Ultimate  can be interrupted pretty easily. You have to be very careful when trying to use it otherwise the enemy will cancel its channel.\n\nVersus poke or champions with a lot of wave clear, it is going to be near impossible for you to roam and help your allies as the enemy will keep you pushed in or take your tower while you\u2019re roaming.\n"}
{"text": "As illaoi, Illaoi is an excellent division pusher. She can take several people on her own because of her tentacles and Ultimate R. At one point, the enemy team will have to send more than two people to face her. Illaoi is also good in team fighting because her Ultimate R prevents the enemy from getting closer to her team. She also carries a lot of damage that can easily wipe a team if they are not careful. Once she gets two points in her Ultimate R, she carries a ton of damage during team fighting. The enemies will not be able to do much, except keep away from her at all times. Illaoi can also use the fog of the war to install death brushes."}
{"text": "As shaco, During the late game, the champions begin to build defensive elements that do not allow Shaco to immediately assassinate someone. He is rather squishy, and is quite inclined to get killed if CC-D when his Ultimate I is down. He will need to play around this ability to succeed. Not a good choice against tanks as he would involve him in changing his construction and riding nearby and personal of these tanks. This is not very ideal, especially against experienced players."}
{"text": "As fizz, When there are no team fights, push and draw enemy attention to you while your team sits or plays on the other side of the map. Fizz is really good at getting choices with its Ultimate R. Look to catch enemies who are alone or are too far ahead. Look to fight anyone trying to prevent you from pushing split or cultivating in a side track. You are a strong 1v1 champion and as long as they are not a tank, you should be able to fight them."}
{"text": "As urgot, Your goal in early play is to take calculated jobs while fighting the enemy. Use your range advantage where appropriate to intimidate the anthill win an advance. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for suitable short jobs. You may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in early play. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}
{"text": "As nautilus, By getting 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will use the ability quite often. Team fights will be a breeze for him from now on. His ability to make team fights unfair due to his selection potential will be quite obvious during this game phase. He only has Ultimate and his enemy out of sight. His tankness will not know any limits during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "Against rell, At Level 1, make sure to harass and poke Rell with basic attacks to get her weak health before reaching Level 2. Get an early health benefit so she can't engage. When Rell reaches Level 6, her Ultimate R can be used in various ways. Don't commit to fighting near her turn as she may seek to play aggressively and get killed."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, His level eleven isn't too good since it doesn't give him a lot of stats. The Ultimate e in itself will be handy, though, and Tryndamere can use the lane brushes to catch the enemy by surprise.\n\nTryndamere is really good at split pushing due to his kit. It allows him to 1 v 1 targets with ease while also ensuring that he can escape in time should the enemy team decide to collapse on him.\n\nHe can pretty much duel any enemy during this stage of the game. This is quite a boon as he can make multiple enemies come to him while his team gets objectives."}
{"text": "As morgana, Level 3 is a massive power peak for Morgana as it will be able to fight both CC enemies, inflict a decent amount of damage on them, and save its CC allies when necessary.

He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability while hiding in a brush.\n\nHis tankiness will be colossal during this phase of the game.

{"text": "As teemo, His Passive can be really obnoxious to deal with, especially when he is hiding in a brush and moving in and out while pelting his laner with his t and t.\n\nHe is the bane of ADC mains as his t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the effectiveness of the carry for a while, which gives his team some time to engage/disengage freely.\n\nThe Ultimate t can act as a substitution for vision, as well as deal a lot of damage when kept in the right spots. This is especially useful when it comes to avoiding ganks."}
{"text": "As draven, Use Draven's early play force to get dead in the way and win a gold lead over the enemy. Draven must play aggressively in the way. Play around enemy abilities to increase your chances of surviving and killing the enemy. If they waste their dash or if the Support uses a hook capability, try to play aggressive. If you have a lot of g batteries, don't be afraid to call for ganks. You have tons of damage and should be able to cash easily if you can overwhelm the enemy with a gank."}
{"text": "As ekko, In the middle of the game, Ekko will have finished several articles. He should be much stronger at this stage of the game. Combined with more articles, at level 11 Ekko will put an additional point in his Ultimate R. He will be able to look for more aggressive and risky pieces. At level 9, Ekko goes max his Q. He will help him farm and trade with the enemy."}
{"text": "As skarner, His tankness is really high during this phase of the game. This should allow him to absorb a lot of damage and be a very effective front line for his team. At level 16, Skarner will put the third and final point in his Ultimate. This will put his Ult on a pretty short cooldown. At this stage of the game, he would have obtained many goals to give his team a great advantage."}
{"text": "Against lulu, When you're not looking to commit yourself, then step back so that it can't attack you automatically. Until Lulu uses his E before fighting or throwing is a good way to get out of the front. Try to lure that ability and then play aggressive as it cools. Post 6 and when Lulu gets his Ultimate R, his survival increases a lot. Keep in mind that it's going to be hard for you to kill her when her Ultimate R is up.

She will have a somewhat endless mana pool once it\u2019s maxed out.\n\nAt level 9, Cass will max out her E. As long as she lands her Q, her bully potential will be incredibly potent.

Be proactive with your Ultimate because it will greatly increase your probability of getting gang killings. Gank every time your Ultimate is up. Focus on securing these goals. You need to take Rift Heralds and Drakes every time you can. You can take it as easily as they can.

{"text": "As ezreal, As Ezreal will do a lot in the way, when your E goldsmith shield is down, make sure to stand behind your minions so it can't land on you. Use your sumptuous skills in the way to clear the minions and push hard into the Turret enemies. Ezreal has little in terms of gank potential, so if you can-push the way. Once the enemy touches level 6, their death pressure in the way increases strongly. Keep this in mind and respect their everything in damage. Keep your R to hunt Ezreal down once he uses Arcane Shift E to escape a gank. Your R will help you and your allies move to Ezreal without problem. If possible, bait this ability with Q beforehand so that you don't have to use your R."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Trading against Heimerdinger can be extremely tedious, but it can be done. Removing his Turrets Q will be the main focus for poke or trading with him. When you use your skill shots (if they are AOE), try to target them so that they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q. This will allow you to clean them up more easily and increase your death pressure in the way. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, his death pressure and strength increase considerably. Keep this in mind and attention to his abilities empowered."}
{"text": "As yone, At level 6, Yone will unlock his Ultimate R, which will allow him to set up games with ease for his Jungler and his team during any stage of the game. Yone will get short peaks of power as he continues to add points to his Q. This will allow him to go for short gusts against his laner so he can do everything later. The first element will bring significant improvements to Yone's trading in the track. Depending on the component he gets, the effects will vary, but it will be good for him independently."}
{"text": "As bard, During the mid-game, Bard\u2019s abilities will be on a lower cooldown. His Q will be on a rather short cooldown, which will allow him to look for more picks throughout this stage of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, while most champions spike at level 11, Bard isn\u2019t really one of them. While his Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown, it doesn\u2019t deal any damage and will most likely be used to get picks or save his allies.\n\nBard should\u2019ve picked up a lot of Meeps by now.

{"text": "As leona, Level 2 is a massive powerpike for Leona. It is because its main all-in-one combo is unlocked at that time, and it deals a lot of damage due to its passive, provided it has a follow-up of its ADC. Its level 6 is another important peak of power in this way. The Ultimate e is on a very small cooldown, and the range is quite massive. This allows it to set up its CC chain quite easily. Boots are undoubtedly one of the most important game purchases for Leona."}

This allows you to abuse your superior range and trade favorably with him.\n\nIt's important to reach level 2 at the same time as Pyke to maintain parity in the laning phase. Having access to your full abilities and level advantage increases your chances of responding effectively to any aggression from the enemy duo.\n\nCommunicate with your team when Pyke goes missing from the lane, as he is a champion known for his roaming potential. By pinging and alerting your teammates, you can help them play more cautiously and be prepared for potential ganks or plays from Pyke in other lanes.\n\nTo minimize the risk of being all-inned by Pyke and his ADC, try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This denies Pyke the opportunity to engage effectively and reduces their chances of initiating aggressive plays. Be mindful of wave management and aim to control the wave position."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven is an early game dominant champion who can take over the lane through short trades. Try not to trade with her unless you can match her trading potential.\n\nRiven will often play hyper-aggressive and try to outplay you with her e. If possible, try to bait out her main abilities and then re-engage when she has cooldowns. This is your best bet when laning against a Riven.\n\nKeep the minion wave frozen near your Tower. If you are playing close to your Tower, her all-in potential is limited as the Tower will protect you and she will not be able to look for frequent trades."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, If Jarvan builds AD, he will be very squishy in the team fights and will get blown up quickly in the team fights. Once he has entered, he will have to engage fully in the fight. To ensure the victory, you must make sure that your team is able to follow. If you enter without them, you will die. Peel, disengagement and CC are the biggest weaknesses. He will be unable to effectively use his d and e combo if the enemy can bring him down, reposition or CC him mid-combo."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, If Wukong invades, it is wise to disengage as it holds hands in early duels. At level 3, be careful when you meet Wukong at a scuttle crab. Unless you have a clear advantage, it is better to step back to avoid unfavorable engagement. Priorize the glove when your ultimate is available, as Wukong is likely to do the same. Capitalize on opportunities to have an impact on the tracks. Expect Wukong to be active with early ganks. You need to maintain a proactive approach by frequently putting the gantage routes in line with its presence."}
{"text": "Against blitzcrank, Blitzcrank can try to fly or delay your first buff. A room in the river at 1:25 is a good way to know whether it goes to Hook b or not. If it shows on the room, make sure that the monster is pulled out so that it can't easily land his Crochet b. Never use your dash or dredging ability unless Blitzcrank has his b on the cooldown. Otherwise, you'll be an easy target for his Crochet b and it will be harder for you to avoid it. If you're a squishy champion or you're without Flash or a dash, don't put yourself in unnecessary danger."}
{"text": "As lucian, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will give him a huge boost and will allow him to take over the middle of the game easily. Lucian is excellent during the middle of the game because it is the moment when he is most powerful. He can now go on a side track and thrust divided due to his passive and basic abilities. That's also why his abilities will hit like a truck, and he will frequently kill enemies. At level 11, Lucian will be able to get his stage 2 Ultimate R. He can help him massively during neutral, objective and duel battles due to the amount of damage he puts on the dishes."}
{"text": "As lucian, The level 2 of Lucian is a decent peak of power because it allows it to go for a devastating total combo. The damage inflicted is relatively high, and it can quite quickly kill the enemy with multiple combo rotations. Level 6 is a significant peak of power, especially when Lucian is against an immobile port. It should have an easy time to release waves with it as well if it has to remember. The first element will be a massive peak of power for Lucian because it allows it to do a lot of damage. It will give it an inherent advantage, especially if it can capitalize on its level 2 peak of power."}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Vladimir's l has an incredibly long cooldown during the laning phase. Find a way to bait him and then watch to play aggressive while he's on cooldown. Whenever Vladimir has his self-appointed Q available, play safer or walk backwards so he is forced to use his Q on the minion wave rather than you."}
{"text": "Against irelia, Try to lock Irelia at the beginning of the fight. This will make it much harder for her to jump around your team and reset to her Q. Avoid fighting too closely together as it will allow Irelia to use her Ultimate R on several people and allow her to reset Q. Stand together but not very closely together. Try and fight after Irelia uses her E as it is one of her best tools to start a fight. Ideally, try and fight also around her Ultimate R as it will reduce her chances of reset."}
{"text": "As rengar, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game. Getting them and securing the Dragon Soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nLook for picks with your team. If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is difficult to play into ranged champions. They can constantly harass and bully her which will make it difficult for her to survive the early game.\n\nYour Q will only be as impactful as you make it. If you use your Q without multiple stacks, the damage will be futile.\n\nHer W doesn\u2019t block tower shots, but it does increase her defensive stats. With this in mind, always think twice before committing to tower dives."}
{"text": "Against naafiri, Ward the river to reduce its ability to get early ganks. If you see that it's getting someone on your team, invade the opposite side of its jungle to remove camps and deny its XP. It can easily secure goals like the Drake or Rift Herald thanks to its Packmates. Make sure they are monitored whenever they're high so it can't take them for free."}
{"text": "Against karma, Make sure you\u2019re always stood behind the minion wave so Karma cannot use her Q on you. Stand behind the minions but not close to them as her Q is an AOE ability.\n\nWhen Karma uses her d, she will be vulnerable to attack. A good time to play aggressively is when she has used it to speed herself or her ADC up.\n\nKarma has her Ultimate a at level 1, so she will be quite strong up until level 6. If you are strong at level 6, you will be stronger than her once you both hit level 6."}
{"text": "As sett, Get level 2 first and look for a favourable trade. Gaining an early health lead is key to getting a kill later on down the line. Level 2 in the bottom lane is the first minion wave followed by the next 3 melee minions.\n\nYour goal during the laning phase is so to look for kills and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to gain a lead.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As vladimir, Has no form of gank agency so will probably not get a gank during the early game. He is quite weak early on as well and is quite useless if the game doesn\u2019t go on for too long. \n\nMisuse of his l can get him killed immediately, especially if the enemy laner holds on to their main crowd control ability. This can make him a very easy gank target.\n\nGrievous Wounds are a bane to his existence, especially if it is procured early. This weakness can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage on him due to the reduced Q health."}
{"text": "As rumble, It can do a lot of damage to enemy units with its self-sustaining R passive which are close to it. This allows it to act easily as a disruptor during team fighting. Its combined e with its d can allow it to easily descend a single enemy target. The shield d allows it to mitigate a good amount of poke as well. Its Ultimate b makes it a threat during team fighting. The enemy team cannot afford to fight in closed spaces or they will certainly be shot down by its Ultimate b."}
{"text": "Against katarina, Make sure you reposition and move away from Katarinas Blade drops. This will reduce her ability to trade and kill you with her r. Do not blindly follow Katarinas roams or you could get ambushed punish her by pushing the wave in her turret every time she leaves the way. One of Katarina's weaknesses is her lack of reach."}
{"text": "As zed, This is the point of the game where Zed will have a lot of difficulty in bringing down the enemies. That's because the enemies will buy defensive objects from now on. Yet, Zed should try to go for isolated targets when possible. At level 16, he will have his ultimate R maximd. This means that he will inflict massive amounts of damage to squishier targets and decimate anyone who has been caught alone / Zed will really have weak cooldowns now, and he can do a lot of damage because of that. This means that he will be the lot of squishier targets on the enemy team, and he can get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "As sylas, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate R is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "Against ksante, His first major power spike is at level 4 when he gets 2 points in his **Q**. It will be easier for him to trade at this time.\n\nWhen his **Ultimate** is up, he is stronger and harder to fight. The extra damage can be quite surprising and hard to handle.\n\nK\u2019Sante spikes when he gets his first item (as well as both component items). Respect his all in potential when he\u2019s completed the recipe as his damage output will heavily increase.\n"}
{"text": "Against veigar, Veigar is at his weakest in the early game. Try to abuse him to set him behind. Delaying his stacks will make him less effective in the later stages of the game.\n\nWhenever Veigar uses his n, try to abuse the cool down as it\u2019s his only defensive tool in the early game and once it\u2019s down- he is rather vulnerable. \n\nIn order to get ganks or kill the Veigar, you need to bait out his n first. You can do this by constantly toggling in and out of range of him. Make sure you always bait it out before committing to the all-in."}
{"text": "Against jax, Jax clears the jungle quickly enough and in good health, so you may not be able to fight it early. But, if you find it weak- go ahead to kill it. Jax is good to take goals alone thanks to his o and e. Make sure you have the Dragon watched at all times so that your team knows if he is on her. If you are nearby when Jax ganks a way, try to counter gank him. Once his e and e have come down, he doesn't really have much in his kit to continue the fight. If you have CC, lock him up and turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "Against jhin, Jhin\u2019s first major power spike is when he hits level 6. Although, his Ultimate R is not going to be effective during the skirmish.\n\nWhen Jhin gets 100% crit damage, his trading power will increase dramatically. Always keep an eye on what items he currently has and avoid fighting him alone if his items are better than yours.\n\nAt level 9, Jhin will be a lot stronger as he would\u2019ve put the final point in his Q."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Kayn is pretty good in early play and will seek to invade/gank as often as he can to get his transformation. When Kayn gets his transformation, he will be much stronger. If he goes Red Kayn, he will be more tankier, if he goes Blue Kayn, he will inflict tons of damage. At level 6, Kayn can be more aggressive and go for more risky games because he can use his ultimate R to protect him from death. Keep this in mind during his struggle."}
{"text": "As jhin, You have to stay with your team in the late game. Do not move around the map or go anywhere unless someone is with you. Stand back from your team near your Support. Avoid walking too far from anyone in the late game. Being caught will lead the enemy will be able to push their advantage and finish the game. Watch for your positioning in the late game. Focus on the kiting and automatic attack of the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so you are not taken out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "Against sett, Once Sett is level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate R, its ability to get killed in the way also increases. Look at your positioning and disengagement if you are weak as his all-in-one combo inflicts a surprising amount of damage. In the middle of the game, Sett will be hard to fight unless you are early or you have help. Avoid fighting and disengagement if he runs on you and tries to fight you."}
{"text": "As lux, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Try to fight as a team in the open air so that he is unable to use his E qualified to stun your entire team. Do not fight in the jungle because the size of his E is about the same as the jungle. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, he technically unlocks 3 new abilities. Be careful trying to initiate a skirmish with him because he could just remove his magic card and kill you."}
{"text": "As trundle, Very good objective control that can allow him to stop counting on his team and get his team forward on his own terms. He can take the early dragons easily, without becoming too low. His Ultimate n allows him to win a huge amount of duel potential that can allow him to go for high priority targets with ease, then exit without dying. His e can allow him to both set up and follow the ganks with ease."}
{"text": "As swain, His early play is excellent as he can completely CC and blow up an enemy target when necessary. Using the brush line will allow him to reap a lot of benefits. Level six is an excellent peak as he can now control the pace of a team struggle. He can easily be between the enemy team while treating a lot of health and regenerate a lot of health in return. The first element will allow him to spam his abilities frequently and deposit a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As pyke, Level 16 is a massive spike for Pyke as the ability will now be up almost every team fight. The damage done will be pretty significant as well.\n\nHis Ultimate R will be critical and effective during fights. Squishies can be one-shot, and he can pretty much take down multiple enemies at once.\n\nHe will have his significant items during this phase of the game which means that he will both deal massive amounts of damage and survive fights and heal himself up quickly."}
{"text": "As trundle, Peel for your carries in late game team fights to increase the chances of your team winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nStick with your team in the late game.

If you focus the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}
{"text": "As drmundo, Grievous Wounds, especially during the early game is his mortal enemy and will allow the enemy to take him down with relative ease. The fact that he is extremely weak during the early game doesn\u2019t help him either.\n\nIf Dr Mundo isn\u2019t ahead, he will find it hard to be the frontline for his team. If he is behind, he will not be able to tank a lot of damage and will have to fall back quite quickly.\n\nWithout his Ultimate m, Dr Mundo doesn\u2019t have much kill pressure or chase potential, unless he can land his t. If he misses his Q when trying to gank a lane, he can\u2019t do anything to shut down the enemy."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah will want to delay a team's fight as long as possible while pushing you with its Q. Try and force a fight as soon as you spot it. Avoid separating and playing alone. Taliyahs Ultimate R will allow it to take enemies who are alone or isolated without assistance. Do not push too far forward if you don't have anyone nearby. Taliyah has good potential with its C. If you don't know where Taliyah is in the middle of the game, don't walk around Summoners Rift alone and avoid areas with no vision that it might be looking for a surprise attack."}
{"text": "As shen, His E is quite short-range that makes it difficult for him to land this clear vision capability. This can hinder his all-in-hand potential. If he uses his W and Q with negligence, then he and his team will be in a really disadvantageous position, and will let themselves down quite easily. His Ultimate R has a very long cooldown and will force him to lose priority almost instantly."}
{"text": "As kalista, Her level 16 isn't too powerful for her as she gets nothing much out of it. It will allow her to set up engages from the fog of war now, though. It will also let her defend her teammates from unfavorable situations with ease.\n\nNow that she has multiple items, she will be really formidable and will be able to deal tons of damage to enemies. Her defensive stats will allow her to survive all-in situations as well.\n\nHer r is solid during this phase of the game. A couple of spears can easily chunk an enemy out, and this ability will also let her take neutral objectives with ease."}
{"text": "As ornn, His Ultimate R is an excellent tool that can set up his Jungler. It is also a good tool in 1v1 fights. Finally, it is great in team fights because it could potentially hit 5 enemies. Ornn scales incredibly well in the later parts of the game. It is one of the few champions that is relatively good at all stages of the game."}
{"text": "As senna, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. However, you will rely on your Support to do heavy lifting early. After destroying the lower track tower, turn to the middle track and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a golden lead."}
{"text": "As lux, Level 2 is an all-in power spike for Lux. She should be able to all-in the enemy by using the lane brushes to drop vision and bamboozling the enemy. If the enemy is cautious, they will be zoned out easily.\n\nLevel 6 is another significant power spike as she will assist her ADC in killing the enemy bot lane. The ability can also be used to safely steal neutral objectives or snipe kills.\n\nThe first item component will make up for good poke as Lux will use the lane brushes to keep harassing the enemy bot lane. Her long range will make it really hard for the enemy to catch up to her.        "}
{"text": "As kled, Flank in team fights and try to take down the squishiest member of the enemy team. Taking someone down quickly will give you a huge advantage.\n\nWhile the enemy is moving into position and preparing to group, someone may be isolated or alone (or they may be too far forward). Pull the trigger and use your Ultimate R to collapse on them.\n\nLook to group with your team in the late game. Grouping is important as you will not be able to impact team fights if you\u2019re away from them- even with your Ultimate R as it takes some time to get into position."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce is really good at poking enemies down with his w > s combo. He can even one-shot targets if he is far ahead of the enemy team. This will allow him to create an advantage for his team before a major fight.\n\nOnce Jayce is full build, no squishy enemy target in the game is safe. This is because he can easily blow enemies up with his w > s combo. Sometimes a single combo is all it takes to kill a target (like a squishy support, for instance). All he needs to do is sit in the enemy Jungle and wait for an unsuspecting enemy to come near.\n\nJayce won't spike at level 16 either because his Ultimate G won't be providing with him a lot of raw stats, which other champions' ultimates offer them with. He will still have to rely on flanking and using the fog of war to poke enemies down. The greater the number of enemies hit, the better it is for his team and him."}
{"text": "As vladimir, If your allies move on your track after destroying their turn, rotate and move around the map to continue growing and winning XP and gold. Use your capabilities to quickly clear the minion waves so your team can besiege/prevent an enemy team seat. If you can land poke while also pushing the minion wave, you can look for a favorable trade. By sitting Baron or Dragon, or whenever you push the enemy under their turn, look for a peak with your abilities. If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you will be able to take the goal for free."}
{"text": "As leona, Maxing out the Ultimate e will allow it to be on a very short cooldown. Leona will readily be available to look for picks in as soon as half a minute.\n\nAs she gets more items, she will be able to absorb a lot of damage very quickly. This will make her a very reliable engager, especially from the fog of war.\n\nLeona's e and r will be maxed out during this game stage. She can look for picks frequently, and her Passive will allow her allies to burst down enemies with ease."}
{"text": "As shaco, Focus on farming early.

When he isn\u2019t with his team, you could force a team fight with the numbers advantage, but be aware that he can use his Ultimate R to join the fight quickly. \n\nOnce Kled has been dismounted, make sure you finish him off quickly otherwise he may be able to remount again and take over the team fight."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, He has a lot of poke damage built in his kit. His s is the most obnoxious one as it helps him both poke and waveclear at the same time. This allows him to freely push the lane and get some damage off as well.\n\nHis d makes him quite a versatile champion and provides him with sustenance in the form of mana. He can even set-up kills for his team with his gold card.\n\nHis Ultimate y makes him the king of macro as he can use it to be present in any team fight, even if he happens to be on the other side of the map. This also allows him to detect every enemy champion on the map, which is quite beneficial for his team."}
{"text": "Against warwick, Warwick is an early game fort Jungler. Vision place inside the river and its jungle entrances to reduce his ability to get successful ganks. With his kit, Warwick can take goals quite quickly and can solo them thanks to the support of his vision Q. Place and take the side of Scuttle Crab bot to spot him before he is able to take it. As Warwick has a strong early game, try to match his pressure by gloveting just as much as he does. If you can't gank in the early game, try to invade his jungle and steal camps when he showed on the other side of the map."}
{"text": "As graves, Place your all-in-one combo properly around the minion wave otherwise, and you will be killed because of your Passive. Use your e to reposition immediately during a duel. Once you get your first element, you will have a easier time duel enemies in the way. Use your e and e very carefully other, you will become a premium gank target for the enemy Jungler. Getting your Ultimate t is a massive peak for you in this way. Use it as a finishing movement for most, but keep in mind that the return can be used defensively."}
{"text": "Against nami, Invest in an Executioner\u2019s Calling to reduce Nami\u2019s healing on herself and her allies. This item is invaluable when the enemy has lots of sustain.\n\nTaking down Nami first before a team fight occurs will make it really difficult for her ADC to survive because they will not have any peel or protection.\n\nAvoid team fighting around objectives or inside the jungle as Nami\u2019s Ultimate R is rather large and if you fight in tight areas, she\u2019s guaranteed to land multiple knock-ups."}
{"text": "As pantheon, It will fall later during the game due to the enemy buying defensive items. It should always rely on peaks to get killed all around the card.

{"text": "As sona, Consider investing in healing reduction items or capabilities to counter the maintenance of Sona. This can help reduce their ability to heal and trade effectively during skirmishes and all-in. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This encourages Sona and their ADC to extend, creating opportunities for your gank jungler and potentially secure kills or summons spells. Enjoy the windows of the opportunity to detach from your ADC and harass Sona when they have used one of their abilities.

As you are a Jungler, you must try to secure each Drake during the middle of the game. Get them and secure the Dragon soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game. Look for choices with your team. If you can choose someone, make the call for Baron or Dragon to continue your lead."}
{"text": "As warwick, Keep making short exchanges with your Q in this matchup, but don't use your E too freely. It can be used to bait Warwick under your turn. Your W will help you a lot in this matchup. Make sure you drop it on him when his E is active and he's running on you. Also, don't stay on the track with poor health. Get some wounds seriously quickly in this matchup. It will allow you to balance the duels that occur in the upper lane. Keep the wave near your turn and ask your Jungler to get you gank regularly. Also, make sure you tell the Jungler to be on top HP otherwise Warwick will see the gank coming."}
{"text": "Against nidalee, When grouping, do not let Nidalee poke you down with her s. Engage as soon as she overextends to throw a Spear s. \n\nNidalee will look to assassinate targets with her s who are walking around Summoners Rift alone. Avoid splitting up and being alone if the enemy Nidalee is ahead.\n\nCC is your best friend when it comes to handling Nidalee in team fights. As soon as she jumps in with her k, CC her and lock her down."}
{"text": "As shyvana, When you try to all-in enemies with your Ultimate t, make a note of your carries. Your job will be to fall back and peel for them if they aren't safe enough.\n\nDepending on the build you go for, you will have different jobs in the team. If going for AP, focus on the backline, else, focus on keeping the enemy frontline off your team.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus on the squishiest and easiest to kill high-priority targets in the backline. Your Ultimate t will help you a lot with that."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn doesn\u2019t have a duelling Ultimate R. This makes her weak post level 6 when it comes to all-ins.\n\nShe cannot fight straight 5v5. She will need to flank in team fights. If the enemy has vision or knows where she is, she will be unable to team fight properly and will be forced to split push.\n\nYou are a champion that is prone to all-in and CC. Mix that with the fact that Quinn is quite squishy, it can be challenging to deal with enemy teams that have a lot of CC."}
{"text": "Against illaoi, Illaoi's R can have a huge impact on team fighting. Do your best to disengage if you can when she throws her Ult. In addition, don't fight in tight areas as it will allow her Rs and tentacles to run ravages. One of Illaoi's forces is that she is hard to kill once she lands several tentacles because of the damage he inflicts and the maintenance he provides. Invest in serious injuries to slow down her healing. Thormail, Morrello's, or Ignite will do the trick. Illaoi's E creates a champion spirit that he strikes. This spirit is treated as a champion for the love of the harvest of darkness. Keep this in mind when pulling and Spirit of your team."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Every time he has 3 Q laps up, he will always be a threat. At level 6, when Heimerdinger unlocks his Ultimate R, he basically gets 3 new abilities. Take care trying to fight him as he could just use any of his abilities to trade with you."}
{"text": "As hecarim, His movement speed increase on his p can allow him to run enemies down with ease. This is especially applicable to immobile carries who rely on their team to live.\n\nThe h allows him to deal consistent damage while also reducing his cooldown on the ability. This allows him to take extended trades while laning, as well as, while jungling. This combined with his rune choices can cause him to sustain himself as well.\n\nHis Ultimate t can be a game-changer in a team fight where the enemy is grouped together. The CC allows him to separate key targets from their team and kill them quickly with his damage."}
{"text": "Against karma, Karma has a powerful early game and is strong enough from levels 1 to 3. Try not to let her too much by hiding between the minion wave and the retreat when she advances. Remember that Karma has her Ultimate has at level 1 and can dry a lot of damage if you are hit by her Q. Karma does not have a peak as well as other Supports at level 6 as she already has her Ultimate has at level 1. You can use this to your advantage to kill her at level 6."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Avoid fighting in the jungle as that will allow Maokai to get a good Ultimate R off. Additionally, avoid fighting around neutral objectives like the Dragon or Baron too.\n\nWhen sieging, make sure no one on your team is too far forward as Maokai can isolate them and catch them out of position with his W. \n\nAs it might be hard for Maokai to team fight, he may try to flank from the side to make it easier to get on to the enemy. He may also use his Ultimate R from the side to CC your whole team. Ward the flanks so you can spot him before he initiates."}
{"text": "As sylas, Sylas is quite strong during the mid-game, especially if he gets a solid ultimate from the enemy team. His life steal will prevent him from dying quickly during significant fights.\n\nTwo points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take enemy ultimates quickly and will increase their effectiveness as a whole. It can be highly beneficial in team fights.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give him a massive damage boost and allow him to blow up single targets with ease.        "}
{"text": "As kayn, Its objective control is powerful in the Jungle. This is due to its increased speeds and its ability to walk through the walls when necessary. This allows it to take strange Jungle paths. Level six is a decent peak of power because it allows it to become invulnerable for a while. It becomes stronger once it manages to get its shape."}
{"text": "As morgana, She is good at ganking her allies as her Q is quite easy to hit and will CC the target for a long period of time.\n\nMorgana has good objective control with her W which allows her to take Drakes with ease.\n\nFurthermore, Morgana has good jungle clear with her W as it has a large area of effect."}
{"text": "Against fizz, When walking around Summoners Rift, do not go alone if you\u2019re squishy. Fizz can easily assassinate somebody who is walking through the river alone. Take appropriate paths through warded areas whenever possible.\n\nDo not use any executing abilities or key skill shots on Fizz unless he has used his E as he can easily dodge them by going untargetable.\n\nIf you\u2019re hit by Fizz\u2019s Ultimate R, do not walk close to your allies as the AOE damage from his shark will deal lots of damage to them too. Walk towards them but don\u2019t get close."}
{"text": "As zeri, During the middle of the game, you will want to change track and use your E with extreme discretion. Also, please make sure that you use it on the appropriate field, you can end up landing directly in the knees of the enemy team. Getting your base elements should help you a lot and will make your Q hit like a truck. Make sure you regularly use it with your loaded attacks. Although you are mobile, make sure you don't hunt an enemy in their Jungle. You are still an ADC and need to help your team win fights rather than hunt with your E."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax will have his e maxed at level thirteen. This will allow him to deal more damage with an increased frequency which is quite beneficial when dealing with picks.\n\nJax will have most of his items and will be able to deal a lot of damage now. Anyone within his leap range will die if they have no form of mobility spell on them.\n\nJax will have a lot of items during this phase of the game. This will help him kill enemies with ease as his Passive will allow him to deal a lot of damage in a concise time."}
{"text": "Against brand, The brand is really strong at level 2 and 3 when it gets access to more abilities. Be ready to back down slightly when it gets the level up so that you don't risk losing your health bar. The more the game goes, the stronger brand gets thanks to the items it will get. Try to put it behind in the game early to reduce its gold income and prevent a snowball. Once the brand reaches level 6, its release of damage and the ability to kill you will be much higher thanks to its ultimate R. If you are weak, make sure you remember because it can easily burst and kill you."}
{"text": "As olaf, He is pretty intense early on due to his Passive and his ability to chase people down with his t. It makes him a pretty good duelist.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike for Olaf as he can now reach his target without being interrupted. If he manages to flank his enemies, the immobile carries will be pretty much doomed.\n\nHis first item component will be a massive spike, increasing his overall damage in the game. It will bolster his overall damage potential."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao will have two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. It will allow him to use the ability more often, which will make it easier for him to convert fighting to 1 v 1 as and when necessary. His first ability will be maximized at the time he reaches level 9. It is a crucial peak of power because he massively increases his damage production and duel ability. Xin is excellent in team fighting and collecting enemies because of his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to distinguish enemies, allowing him to be immune to various maneuvers."}
{"text": "Against zyra, When it goes to pupil goals, the ambush and shoots it before the team fight starts thus the enemy lacks crowd control and damage. This can help to swing the team fight in your favor. Avoid moving through areas not awarded on the map because Zyra has great capture potential with its E and Ultimate R. Do not move through high traffic areas not awarded if you do not know where Zyra is. Do not fight in the jungle or around a goal like the Dragon or Baron as your team will be pretty close together that could allow him to get a multi-person E and Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Kog'Maw will have several objects during this phase of the game. This will give him a lot of damage to his enemies and just sculpt a path through the enemy front line. Kog'Maw is very squishy and can be killed quickly in the end of the game by assassins or enemies with tons of CC. He will have to rely on his team to help him survive. Getting 3 points in his Ultimate will amplify the poke damage inflicted by the ability."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is one of the strongest early game champions in the game. You can use this advantage to gain an early lead.\n\nExtended trades work in the favour of Darius thanks to his Passive. He will win almost every auto-attack battle. This makes him a great duelist in low ELO as many players like to constantly fight.\n\nIs really good in team fights thanks to his Ultimate e which can be reset if he gets the killing blow with it."}
{"text": "Against taric, At level 6, Taric has lots of added protection thanks to his Ultimate R. At this time, killing him or the enemy ADC will be difficult. Once he activates his Ultimate R, you may need to disengage from the fight unless you can kill the enemy.\n\nTaric is really good in mid and late game team fights as his team will be grouped closely together which allows him to get a good Ultimate R off.\n\nDepending on his ADC, Taric can be really good at levels 1-3. If his ADC isn\u2019t very strong, then his early game isn\u2019t too good. However, when he\u2019s paired with an early game dominant ADC, you\u2019ll need to watch your positioning so he cannot land an early E. "}
{"text": "As lux, Very immobile and can be killed almost immediately if she is caught out without her g. Layered CC will make her absolutely useless.\n\nShe is somewhat item reliant, so camping and killing her a lot during the early game will just make her a shield bot during the late game.\n\nShe can be picked off easily by the enemy team if she wanders too far from her team, or when she is trying to take the Blue Buff. She will also be very weak against complete all-ins from the enemy team."}
{"text": "As varus, Varus is subject to all-in because he does not have a dash. If the enemy layeres CC on him, he will die very quickly. Varus, the only self-peel tool is his Ultimate R. When he is down, he can easily be all-in, by a strong enemy laner. If Varus falls behind early, he will struggle to return to the game: whatever its construction."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Don't regroup or fight in the jungle because this will allow Rumble to get a good Ultimate b off. By fighting out, it will be harder for him to get an Ult 5 people b. Never try to take a goal like Baron or Dragon if Rumble is alive and kick. As you will be close enough together inside the pit, you will allow him to land a devastating b on your entire team. Rumble is inclined to disengage. As soon as he uses his Ultimate b, try to disengage or reposition so it is harder for him to follow the damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "Against lulu, Lulu is strong at level 6 as her Ultimate R provides tons of utility and increases her or her ADC\u2019s survivability.\n\nOnce Lulu has completed her first item, her protection and shielding ability will increase dramatically. At this stage, she will also do a hefty amount of damage when trading.\n\nLulu is very good in team fights as she will build items that buff her team up. Try and lock her down with CC or kill her when she goes to ward so she is unable to affect the team fight."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Ornn\u2019s first major power spike is at level 6. His Ultimate R is a great tool to set up kills and ganks.\n\nOrnn is also very good in team fights as his Ultimate R could enable him to knockup and CC your whole team. \n\nHe will become stronger and stronger the more levels he gets under the belt. Firstly he will be tankier with the items, but he will also upgrade his teams items which makes them even stronger too."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen can do a lot of damage very quickly with a fully stacked Q. Look for jobs when you have max batteries. His Ultimate R can be recast several times. It also offers him a cure that helps him in 1v1 fights. Your W is an excellent tool that can stop incoming abilities such as Thresh Q or Blitzcrank b. Although he does not protect your allies, you can get between you and the enemy so your ally doesn't get CC."}
{"text": "As olaf, The second point in its Ultimate k will give it another peak. It can run enemies frequently now that the cooling of capacity will be reduced. Olaf will have its basic elements during this phase of the game. It will increase its damage and survival in the game a thousand times. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This means that it can hunt enemies quickly, and it will hit enemies like a truck."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Look to fight her when she doesn\u2019t have many Q stacks as her ability to trade back with you will be reduced. Her damage output will be lower when she has no stacks.\n\nGood times to look for fights are when she has used her W. When she activates her W, she will gain bonus defensive stats. If you can bait it out, or disengage when her W is active, you will find it easier killing her when it is on cooldown.\n\nExtended trades work in her favour. Try and keep them short and sweet- around her Passive."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to 1 v 1 target quite frequently. He should be able to secure picks even now.\n\nHe is pretty decent during late-game fights, as his AoE abilities will hurt a lot. His survivability is quite appreciable as well.\n\nHis tankiness will be massive during this phase of the game. He should be focused on absorbing a lot of damage for the enemy team while simultaneously picking off enemies when possible."}
{"text": "As syndra, Syndra is really potent during the mid-game as she can dish out a lot of damage to squishy enemies. She can easily set up death brushes as well.\n\nMultiple points in her Ultimate R will allow her to blow off enemies with ease. Enemy squishies will have a tough time dealing with Syndra.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level 9, and she will be dishing out a lot of damage consistently. She can also deal a lot of damage if she is sitting somewhere out of vision.        "}
{"text": "Against kled, Keep in mind that Kled will try to play super aggressive in the early game to get a murder. Stay at maximum distance and avoid overextending if you are weak early play laner. When duelling Kled, keep an eye on his secondary bar. If it is almost full, he will climb during the skirmish and he will be able to kill you. Avoid going for prolonged duels when he is about to go up. Try and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. So do his all-in-less effective. Nor will he be able to pursue you with his Ultimate R once you walk on the farm."}
{"text": "Against diana, If you meet her on the fault alone and she shows up her Q, step back if you can't kill her. Diana can start to glove after level 3 and will constantly look at gank post level 6 whenever her Ultimate R is at the top. Keep this in mind and try to gank as often as possible to make her harder impact on the map when she arrives at her. Be aware of her level 6 power peak because it is huge for her. Keep track of her beginning through the rooms and try to delay her peak of power as long as possible by taking her camps or killing her in her jungle."}
{"text": "As kindred, As you are good at getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Summon Rift alone. After killing someone, call for a close goal. Try to secure the Baron or Dragon whenever possible. Securing goals is the key as a Jungler during the middle of the game. Continue cultivating your jungle as well as gank and helping your allies."}
{"text": "As sion, An additional point in his Ultimate R will increase his overall damage and allow him to use the ability frequently. He will help him massively during team fighting or trying to secure peaks. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be respectable enough now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability by hiding in a brush. His tankness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will absorb the turn shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow his commitments."}
{"text": "Against vayne, Vayne will often be left alone to divide the thrust and the farm. While she is away from her team, you could look to collapse on her and bring her down. Do not engage several players to kill her though if she bots and the Baron up. Vayne is subject to CC. Locking up at the beginning of the fight will make incredibly difficult for her to kite, cause damage and win the team battle. Playing around her Ultimate n will be a great way to increase your chances of killing Vayne in a team fight. Force a team to fight one after the other will reduce her chances of surviving in the next."}
{"text": "Against brand, Avoid fighting in tight quarters such as inside the jungle or around an objective. This will make his Ultimate R a lot less potent. With that said, when grouping try not to group too close together so he cannot bounce his Ultimate R between multiple champions either. \n\nIn the later stages of the game, Brand will go and ward objectives alone. Use this to your advantage by setting up an ambush and taking him down before an objective spawns.\n\nBrand will try to deal a lot of damage and delay a team fight for as long as possible while poking you down. To prevent him from destroying your health bar, you need to fight him as soon as you see him."}
{"text": "Against lux, Lux is really strong once she unlocks her Ultimate n. At this stage, she will be able to get kills and burst you down.\n\nOnce Lux has max cooldown reduction, her abilities will be on really low cooldowns. This means she\u2019ll be able to poke and trade quite frequently. Do not get caught out by her low cooldowns.\n\nIn the later stages of the game, Lux is really strong and can quite easily take down any target if she lands her g. Try and set her behind in the early game so she is unable to get tons of AP and snowball."}
{"text": "As yone, At level 6, Yone will unlock his Ultimate R, which will allow him to set up plays with ease for both his Jungler and his team during any stage of the game.\n\nYone will get brief power spikes as he keeps adding points to his Q. This will allow him to go for short burst trades against his laner so that he may all-in them later on.\n\nThe first item component will bring significant improvements to Yone's trading in the lane. Depending on which component he gets, the effects will vary, but it will be good for him regardless.        "}
{"text": "As graves, The first component will give Graves a small powerpike but will give it an important boost. It will be able to evacuate its camps quickly and can respond effectively to counter-gangs. Level 3 is an important power peak because Graves can now pull the ganks successfully and the enemies of slow / near sight with its e. It will allow it to play circles around its target with ease. Once it arrives at level 6, it will have unlocked a considerable finishing movement. It can remove several targets with the greatest ease if it goes for the construction of the lethality. The ability also provides it a way to escape when its e is down."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Don't try to hunt Zeri down the jungle or river because she probably waits for her E to be back and she will use it to escape. Look for the fights when she's not around. Her Ultimate R is really useful in the fights, so fighting when she's not there is favorable. Ward your flanks in the middle of the game! Zeri can use his E to close the gap of a wall and surprise himself on your team."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin can try to kick someone like the CDA in his teammates. Group closely together to make it harder for him to throw a hand in his team's arms. As Lee Sin needs to get on someone in order to kick them to his team, lock him up with CC as soon as he engages is ideal because he is rather squishy and will be unable to escape if he is chained CC. Lee Sin is really good at removing or removing isolated targets. Make sure you group closer to your team to make it harder for him to take anyone alone."}
{"text": "As leesin, If Lee Sin falls behind in the early game, he will struggle in the later parts of the game.\n\nLee Sin is vulnerable to hard engage and CC. If the enemy has lots of CC, you will need to play around their CC tools if you want to perform any cool manoeuvres with your Ultimate k.\n\nHe struggles in the lane when playing against champions with good counter engage, short cooldowns and range: especially if they know how to manage the minion waves."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven will try to divide the thrust when there is no team fight. Make sure that someone who can challenge it is sent to prevent it from pushing. Avoid fighting it in the middle of the game, but unless you are stronger. Teamfighters will be difficult for Riven because it is subject to CC, disengagement and gets kitted by the champions easily. To make the team fight easier, she will probably flanculate or Flash to engage."}
{"text": "Against sivir, If your team is able to do so, you could collapse on it and on the Support, then force a goal like the Dragon or the Baron with the digital advantage. Group like a team and avoid breaking up too much. Sivirs Ultimate R is an excellent tool to launch team fights and if it is able to collapse on a target that is alone or overheard. In team fights, make sure you can bait or play around Spell Shield E. If you are able to play around, killing it will be much easier."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Can inflict heavy amounts of damage in very short time, which gives the enemy very little time to react. Such a C E Q combo can ruin the lives of enemy travellers. Its Ultimate R allows him to cross a long distance almost immediately and can provide a lot of utility in the bottlenecks. It will also give him traction to easily land his C. His E is really effective against enemies who have some form of dash. It can thus make life a living hell for travelers who rely a lot on dashes."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, After level 6, you will need to use the brushes and your d to leave him in bad health for an all-in with your h. If you are in a trade, you have to consider and be aware of his shield bar, and also not commit to it completely until he uses his W, because he can turn the tide of a fight. Push aggressively and look for trading windows up to level 3, then step back and let the wave push towards you. In this time, you should resort to spamming d to inflict damage to Mordekaiser. Mordekaiser's weakest point is at level 1 since he does not have his abilities and cannot stack his Passive reliably, so you can allow yourself to extend the trades with him to a degree."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Focus on securing objectives when possible in the mid-game. You can take them alone or with your team.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R. Fiddlesticks Ultimate R is really good and should result in a kill each time. Keep assisting your laners and go for picks with your Ultimate R.\n\nMake sure you group with your team but use your Ultimate R from an unwarded area of the map. This will help your team get kills and secure objectives."}
{"text": "Against lillia, Try and burst Lillia down as quickly as you can in a team fight so she is unable to use her Ultimate R to put your whole team asleep.\n\nKeep an eye on where Lillia is when moving around the river and sieging objectives like the Baron or Dragon as she may use her E to deal some burst damage to you and your team.\n\nKeep in mind that in team fights, her Ultimate R will be able to put enemies who have stacks on them to sleep. Avoid letting her auto-attack or deal damage to lots of champions to reduce her chances of CC\u2019ing the whole team."}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Vladimir\u2019s l has an incredibly long cooldown during the laning phase. Find a way to bait it out and then look to play aggressive while it\u2019s on cooldown.\n\nWhenever Vladimir has his empowered Q available, play safer or walk backwards so he is forced to use his Q on the minion wave rather than you.\n\nWhen playing as an AD champion, try to get an Executioner\u2019s Calling. This will reduce his healing and sustain in lane. "}
{"text": "As karma, Poke the enemy as much as possible with your Q to lower them. Use your early lane dominance to gain a health advantage over the enemy. Focus on agriculture and poking during the laning phase. You should not really commit yourself to fighting the enemy. At level 6, Karma does not have access to a Ultimate like most champions."}
{"text": "As jax, The first element of Jax allows him to drive out the enemies during a prolonged fight. He will let him stack his passive and completely decimate his enemies. Going to regular jobs of short burst using the brushes of the way will help him a lot. Level 6 is a decent peak of power because it will increase his survival during the fighting. Once he will have more articles, this ability will help him to kill the enemies with ease, and he will be able to resume the game with his scaling. Jax is not very early because he is dependent enough on the article. He should focus on agriculture and short skirmishes to clean the killings."}
{"text": "Against galio, Try and stay at max range at all times to make it very hard for Galio to use his E and W aggressively to taunt you. He is much stronger and has good gank set up when he\u2019s healthy and both of these abilities are up. \n \nGalio\u2019s biggest power spike is reached at level 6. His R gives a large opportunity to gank and assist other lines or introduce himself in a team fight. However, he doesn\u2019t have much kill threat against enemy laners in a 1v1 at level 6.\n \nAfter Galio has completed his first item and has many points in his Q and E, he will be able to quickly push the wave and roam. Try and match his wave clear and keep him pushed in so he cannot roam for free."}
{"text": "As azir, The main goal is to get your first element quickly while making sure that you don't get CC'd and all-in'd. Use your W and r with the utmost discretion. Shove the wave when possible and punish the enemy launch with your self-directed soldier-attacks. It will slowly allow you to get a healthy lead in the path after which you can either look to all-in or roam. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to do much more in this path. The plan is always the same, whip your enemy first, and then look all-in with your Ultimate R. Take the position of the enemy Jungler first into consideration."}
{"text": "Against skarner, His trading power increases at level 4, as he will have multiple points in his Q and access to all his basic abilities.\n\nOf course, his second major power spike is at level 6 when he unlocks his Ultimate.

Be on the lookout for all-ins, and avoid committing to trades unless you can win them."}
{"text": "As elise, Her mobility makes it really quite hard for you to win any fight versus her, so it\u2019s probably best to avoid trying to fight her early on.\n\nShe is an early ganker and has a strong early game presence. Look to counter gank her and try to be as proactive as you can be early on.\n\nAt level 6 is where you truly come online. Look to gank whenever your Ultimate is up.\n\nEnsure you\u2019re focusing those objectives as you have good objective control and can take them easily.\n"}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is really good at the end of the game. His abilities will hit like a truck due to his articles. His Ultimate e will be pivot to win the game. Once he gets 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will allow him half-healthy enemies squishy easily. This means that all those behind the enemy team will suffer a lot. At this stage of the game, Karthus would have maximized his 1 and e. His release of damage in the team fights will be very high."}
{"text": "As zed, At the end of the game, look for choices on immobile or misplaced enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team as well. In team fights, continue to focus on the most squishiest targets and easier to kill high priority in the backline. Flank in team fights to get the enemy backline up easily. Make sure to be close to your team at any time so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As kalista, As she gets her core items, she should become really strong and can easily win a fight as long as she has space and agency to kite around. Her r should be stacked and used only when a kill is guaranteed.\n\nKalista's Ultimate x can come in very handy during this stage of the game. She can pop out of vision with her Ultimate x activated, and allow her Support to immediately get on top of some other laner/laners. In short, she can roam better once her wave is pushed up.\n\nFighting in open areas should be her modus operandi. This will give her additional power because she can use her Passive to kite the enemy team out. A CC'ed Kalista is a dead Kalista."}

Taking down his Turrets Q will be the main focus in order to poke or trade with him.\n\nWhen using your skills shots (if they\u2019re AOE), try and aim them so they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q. This will make it easier for you to clear them down the line and increase your kill pressure in lane.\n\nOnce Heimerdinger reaches level 6, his kill pressure and strength increase dramatically.

When you get your items, you should have a really easy time to blow up enemies with ease. Set some deep areas to facilitate long-range Qs on the enemy team.

Make sure you are still behind at least 1 minion so that it can't push you and poke you at the same time. Once Corki completes its first element, it will do a lot of damage and will seek to be more aggressive. Keep this in mind during trading. Corki can be really good in the middle of the game and in these team fights. Make sure you turn it off early so that it isn't very strong during the middle or end of the game."}

Don't let the enemy Jungler get all the Dragons. Try to secure them with your team after ruining the lower lane. Beware of Jarvan's early play pressure. They are much stronger than you and will try to make games to get themselves and their teammates before."}

{"text": "Against sona, Before level 6, try to abuse it as much as possible. Once it is level 6, its death pressure increases as its Ultimate R is an excellent duel tool and has a great gank set up as well.

{"text": "As garen, As it lacks any form of varied engagement potential, it is really weak against the various enemy champions. It counts on the side of the enemy team of the side line. If the enemy team manages to put the right vision, the game plan of Garens will collapse and it will be useless especially if your team managed to place it behind early. Due to it having several constructions, the efficiency of Garens can vary from one game to the next. If he decides to go for the complete AD construction when his team lacks a front line, he has not been able to do anything if it is handed over. This should be a good signal for the enemy Jungler/team to camp whenever possible."}

{"text": "As irelia, The damage she can deal with a fully stacked Passive, along with her increased damage to shield mechanic, allows her to perform a lot of outplays if she uses her Q in a proper fashion along with her Passive. This can allow her to get rid of multiple enemies single-handedly.\n\nHer E allows her to land a multi-man CC chain, which can be used as an extension of CC to already CC\u2019d targets. It also allows her to Q to such targets without putting that ability on cooldown. This ability can be the difference between a won team fight, or a botched up all-in, depending on its use.\n\nHer Ultimate R not only prevents the enemy from escaping quickly, but it also allows her teammates to land their own CC on the slowed/trapped enemy team.

Then, with a short cooldown, she will take more fights and easily pick enemies in the side lanes.\n\nAt this point, due to her items, Irelia will be extremely tanky and will be dealing tons of damage. The amount of damage she deals will catch most enemies off-guard, especially if she manages to flank the enemy.\n\nIrelia is especially good in fights, specifically fights which occur around choke points. This is because her Ultimate R limits the enemy's movement and allows her teammate to dive on the enemy."}

Xayah is really decent during team fighting because she can deposit tons of damage consistent with her W and E. She just needs to position herself well."}
{"text": "As taric, Once Taric gets 3 points in his Ultimate R, he will have a very easy time fighting with enemies. The short period of invulnerability can easily win Taric's team.

Taric is also quite tanky during this phase of the game because he will have a lot of articles now."}

This also means that he can act as an engager for a team and then revert back to peeling for his carries once the engagement is over. \n\nOnce he gets three points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to use it frequently and deal a lot of damage to the enemy team at a go. He should be able to catch enemies off-guard easily, especially when using the fog of war."}
{"text": "As nilah, Her first power spike is at level 3 when she gains access to all her basic abilities.\n\nWhen she completes her first item, her trading and skirmishing power intensifies.\n\nAnother early game power spike is level 6, where she unlocks her Ultimate R ability.\n"}
{"text": "As neeko, When no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easier. Use your W to speed yourself up to get off a good Ultimate R.\n\nLook for picks during the mid-game. If you can pick someone off with the help from your allies, you can abuse their death timer to earn more gold and possibly take a tower, an objective or get more kills."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, His e will be maximized at level 9. It's horrible for the enemy teammates group-up who can easily target his e and melt down. Level 11 allows Kog'Maw to do a lot of poke damage to the enemies. The wide range also allows him to take ill-healthed enemies recalling at a distance. He will be perfect during the middle of the game, provided he doesn't collapse and stops. CC is his worst enemy, and Kog'Maw will have to keep an eye on his flanks at all times."}
{"text": "As twitch, Twitch's first ganks are really powerful, and his level two gank is incredibly odious. Twitch's s allows him to remain undetected, allowing him to bypass the vision at the beginning of the game. Level 6 is a massive power peak for Twitch because it allows him to excel in important battles. His ability to impact the grouped battles will allow him to take the game at first with ease. Twitch's objective control is quite strong as he can bamboozle enemies with his s. He is effortless for him to make a reminder of suddenly lancing enemy after a gank and then go to the goal with his teammates."}
{"text": "As aatrox, In the later parts of the game, stick with your team and look for picks. Avoid splitting up or being too far apart from them as the enemy may force a fight while you\u2019re nowhere nearby.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R and avoid committing to fights while it is on cooldown. If you fight while it\u2019s on cooldown, you\u2019ll miss out on a lot of healing and extra damage, which can make the difference in a late-game team fight.\n\nIn team fights, flank the enemy to make it easier for yourself to get onto the enemy backline. Positioning away from your team but close enough to join the fight could give the enemy a false sense of security, making the enemy think the fight is 4v5: forcing them to overextend.\n"}
{"text": "As nunu, Really bad against the disengaged champions because he can't do anything to avoid being disturbed while using his W. Disengage and CC can also interrupt his Ultimate R, which can lead to much less damage to his end. The healing reduction can easily counter him during the early match. This will allow the enemy to take Targets quite easily after getting rid of Nunu as he won."}
{"text": "As twitch, Its positioning is important in team battles as well, otherwise it can be flanked by enemy assassins and be immediately removed. Without its Ultimate c or s, its ability to dominate a team struggle decreases considerably. The fight during this stage will give the enemy team a much greater chance of winning. Virtually gets counterbalanced by a Control Ward because it forces it to reroute. It is because of the short-term nature of its automatic attacks, which allows it to detect itself quite easily."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Always look at your positioning during the laning phase. Try and stay at maximum distance so it is more difficult for her to root with her E. This will also make it harder for her to get a good R Ultimate as she has to close the gap in order to stun you. Stand outside the minion wave at any time if possible. This will make it harder for Neeko to push you and poke you at the same time with her Q. Once Neeko has its Ultimate R, her death pressure will increase. Make sure to come back when she is low whenever she has her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Can be killed almost immediately if it is taken out of reach of one of its allies. The same applies if its W is on cooling. Its E costs a lot of mana so it is very susceptible to poke damage. Once out of mana, it can not really do much in the way. It will often be left alone to go and room, which you can capitalize on. Or, it will not go to custody without a port, which you can abuse to gain an advantage on it."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, Don't fight Miss Fortune and her team inside the jungle as her Ultimate e will cover all the way that will allow her to inflict tons of damage on your entire team. As soon as Miss Fortune channels her Ultimate e, try to cancel it by CC. If you can cancel it quickly, its release of damage will be very low. Don't regroup to close together as Miss Fortune will be able to hit your entire team with her Ultimate e. Separater is not a bad idea trying to fight as a team."}
{"text": "As vi, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting with out it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As katarina, If she doesn't use her r correctly, then she will end up dying a lot because of being CC. She relies on the lack of vision to move and acquire murders. If the enemy team sets up a good vision and has enough card consciousness, they can easily prevent Katarina from getting an advance. Misposition and the use of her Ultimate R at the wrong time can make her a pretty easy target for the enemy. Her Ultimate R attaches it in place, so that it can be targeted by a CC channel."}
{"text": "Against graves, The automatic attacks of Graves are not always effective because monsters/minions/turns block its damage and consume a bullet. Stay behind a monster or minion to avoid its automatic attack damage. When you fight around the Scuttle Crab, make sure it is between you and him to block a car. When you dualize Graves, try to stay away from the ground because he will use it to his advantage to blow up his l faster."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Very strong when the enemy is pushed up and a new wave of minions is approaching. This allows him to use his E to catch up his enemy lantern and then hit them with his r. Yasuo can quite easily set up ganks with this tactic as well. Playing around the W can allow him to completely dismantle the various enemy matches. He can run around the windshield and save himself from a lot of damage in this way. Aglaist melee champions, it is always wise to retreat and maintain a certain distance from them. After six, he becomes extremely strong due to his Ultimate R crowd control as well as the penetration of the bonus armor he gets on the use."}
{"text": "As malphite, During this phase of the game, your only goal is to target the enemy backline and decimate them if you go AP. Use the fog of the war to do so. If you manage to see someone negligent enough to be sideline alone, just go and kill them. This will allow you to get an advantage of numbers and make an unfair fight."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Gragas will look to gank a lot in the early game. Try to counter this by having a good vision around the map so that you can spot it before it gets to a track. Gragas is a powerful Duke and can easily get down a target if he gets the jump on them with his E. If you can avoid the E, you will have a easier time to fight. As Gragas will glove a lot early, his jungle will be open to the elements. If you spot him on the upper side of the map, you should invade his lower jungle side and steal his camps."}
{"text": "As sett, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Gwen will be stronger when she has 4 stacks on her Passive. Avoid committing to fights when she has max stacks.\n\nWhen Gwen unlocks her Ultimate R, she will be much stronger and her trading power increases dramatically.\n\nExtended trades will always work in her favour, especially once she completes an item or two. Avoid fighting her alone unless you can burst her down and kill her."}
{"text": "As amumu, He\u2019s really weak early on without his s and is prone to poke in the laning phase.\n\nTeam fighting can be difficult for Amumu as you\u2019re prone to disengage, poke and CC. Be prepared to flank in team fights to make it easier for you to catch the enemy out of position.\n\nRelies on the ADC to follow up and play aggressively with you. If they don\u2019t play aggressive, you\u2019ll struggle to get kills and win lane. "}
{"text": "As ezreal, Ezreal is mobile, but not as mobile as you. Just use your E with discretion to get to him quickly.\n\nAvoid getting poked out by his Q in this matchup. You may use your W to do so if you have no other way.\n\nPost-six, you should be able to all-in Ezreal regularly in this matchup. Just make sure that his E is down beforehand.\n\nKeep the wave in the middle of the lane or close to your turret. Try to expose Ezreal to ganks this way."}
{"text": "As swain, Multiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take over fights much easily. His damage output will be pretty phenomenal as well.\n\nHis mid-game presence and fighting style is really great. He can zone off enemies and separate the enemy front line from the backline. He can also pick off-targets.\n\nThe first ability will be maxed at level 9, adding a lot of burst damage to his kit. It helps Swain get rid of squishy targets quickly.        "}
{"text": "As rengar, Rengar will start falling off as the game goes on, so he will have to accumulate a lead early on. He should rely on picks to win the game.\n\nHe will have many items during this phase of the game, which will let him dish out a lot of damage if he manages to catch an enemy.\n\nLevel 16 is a massive power spike, which means that he can completely decimate enemies who are singled out. He will need to frequently find flanks on the enemy to ensure that he can take over the game and win quickly."}
{"text": "Against blitzcrank, Blitzcrank will play hyper-aggressive at level 2 in attempts to get an early kill or to blow your Summoner Spells. Make sure you hit level 2 before or at the same time as him which is the first wave followed by the next 3 melee minions.\n\nBlitzcrank is useless and offers limited resources when his b is on cooldown. While it\u2019s down, make sure you make use of his vulnerability and look to abuse the cooldown.\n\nAt level 6, Blitzcrank can deal a surprising amount of damage. Try to avoid his Hook b so he is unable to all-in you with his combo."}
{"text": "As karma, Poke the enemy as much as possible with your Q to get them low. Use your early lane dominance to gain a health advantage over the enemy.\n\nFocus on farming and poking during the laning phase. You shouldn\u2019t really commit to fighting the enemy.\n\nAt level 6, Karma doesn\u2019t gain access to an Ultimate a like most champions. If you\u2019re playing against someone with a strong all-in, play safe whenever their Ultimate a is up."}
{"text": "As zilean, At level three, Zilean will have access to all his abilities. This will allow him to play aggressively as well as poke the enemy mercilessly in the lane.\n\nLevel 6 offers quite a lot of protection to Zilean as it can allow him to counter lethal burst damage with ease. It will also make his opponent's job way harder than it is supposed to be.\n\nZilean's Ultimate t is going to be helpful in fights. Zilean's first item component will allow him to spam his abilities frequently, making life miserable for the enemy team. It does help a lot when dealing with champions who have a lot of burst damage in their kit.        "}
{"text": "As zilean, Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. So your goal during the laning phase is to look for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As nasus, Incredibly low early play. This means that he needs to play safely and avoid trading until he gets several levels under his belt. He has a lot of bad matches. In the current meta, he will fight many enemy champions. He relies heavily on the late game to win. As the games end around or before the 30-minute mark, his late porting potential is diminished."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, The Pantheon's beginning game is incredibly heinous. Expecting it to play aggressively at level 1 or 2. Unlike most Aggressive Supports, Pantheon's level 6 is not only good in 2v2 skirmishes in the lower track. However, it has good roaming potential and can help its allies from afar. Pantheon will always be a threat when his W is up as he can use it to stun you. Playing towards the opposite side of the way to make it harder for him to engage with you."}

He can run down squishy targets, execute them and use his Passive for much longer than any other champion in his situation.\n\nHe will have his core items by this phase of the game.

{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine is an easy-to-learn champion. You don't need to spend so much time learning it compared to someone like Akali or Camille. She has a lot of CC thanks to her Passive, E and Ultimate R. She also has a healing and shield with her W. This makes her a great utility champion. Her Ultimate R has the potential to hit the entire enemy team. The more you hit, the more he will go. If you are able to get a good Ultimate Roff, you will increase your chances of winning the team fight."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Hecarim is a strong duel in early play and will try to kill you in solo early on. Don't underestimate his early play damage as it will usually come out ahead. Look what the caller Spells Hecarim has taken. If he has taken Ignite, he will seek to play ultra-aggressive early to get killed. If you are low, don't try and trade with him as he will end up with Ignite. Try and keep the short and soft jobs as Hecarim does really well in the extended jobs thanks to his W that will heal him and his h that is on a cool bottom."}
{"text": "As elise, Really strong ganker and a very aggressive playstyle. Her E can allow her to get long ranged picks and then follow up on them with her Q and W.\n\nHer E can allow her to escape the impact of CC abilities as well as buy precious time for her to get out of a botched all-in.\n\nOnce she completes her first item, she will be able to burst down squishy champions with the utmost ease.

{"text": "As sivir, Just like in the middle of the game, you have to stay with your support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone because you will die easily. Do not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and automatic attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will concentrate and down you. Continue kiteing in team fights and systematically adapt your positioning."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's damage will increase by a lot once he gets his first item. It will allow his Q and E to hit like a truck during all-ins.\n\nOnce Galio hits level 6, he unlocks the ability to make cross-map plays around the map. This is advantageous for his team and will let you impact the game a lot more.\n\nSince Galio has limited range, he will have a hard time early during the game. However, he can use his Q to bypass this. When using his Q, he should try to hit the enemy champion for bonus points."}

This is an excellent power spike for Yasuo as his damage output increases massively and his r tornado poke increases drastically. The lane brushes will help you a lot with this as well.\n\nHis mid-game power spike is dependent on his team comp as well. Yasuo will be able to do a lot more in the game with ease if Yasuo's team has a form of knockup on any of their champions.

{"text": "As zilean, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible.

{"text": "As akali, In the meantime, try to land your Q on the wave of the minion and the enemy champion. Since you use energy, and your abilities are hungry for energy, you should always take a look at your resource bar before trying an all-in. Keep track of the enemy Jungler from the beginning of the game as he will try to camp your way until you reach level 6. Use your E discreetly in this way because it allows you both the all-in and the disengagement against the enemies. Your goal should be to get your first item as quickly as possible so that your all-in becomes more powerful and deadly."}

Yasuo is really good in team fights if he is chosen in a team with several knock-ups."}
{"text": "Against ashe, Catch Ashe out of position when she goes to the theater. Then you can look to take Baron or the Dragon while she's dead. Keep a constant eye on your champion's movements in the middle and end of the game as Ashe will usually throw her Ultimate w --Recklessy- in attempts to start the fight. Dodge it and then capitalize on the cooldown. Be ready to step back from a goal if Ashe uses her k to spot the vision. If your team is spotted, the enemy will try to challenge the goal that can lead to your team launch the game."}

If she hasn't been playing aggressive before level 6, expect her to do so once she gets the level up.\n \nTry not to give Akali kills in the early game.

Try to fight in the open air and separate slightly so she can't CC your entire team. Seraphine will often go to the hall alone during the middle of the game. You can use this to your advantage to fight and choose her. While she's dead, you can look to take the Baron, a Dragon or look for a team fight with the advantage of numbers."}
{"text": "As khazix, Once he gets two points in his Ultimate R at level 11, his power to assassinate his targets and escape unscathed will increase drastically. As long as he uses his abilities properly, he will have an effortless time taking over the game.\n\nKha'Zix's Q is his main damage ability which will be maxed out at level 9. He can practically one-shot squishies at this point, especially if they are isolated. It will also let him clear Jungle camps pretty quickly.\n\nMid-game is the part of the game where champions are roaming around, warding, and changing lane assignments. This is why this time is beneficial for Kha'Zix as he can get multiple solo picks on the enemy and ultimately dismantle the enemy game plan."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar cannot wander as much as the other runners. He is also unable to follow the majority of roarings due to his low potential 1v1. While his Ultimate R is on the cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable to all-in. While you are channeling your Ultimate R, you will be still. This can allow an untargeted champion to fight you or kill you."}
{"text": "Against akali, Akali has a powerful early game with her Q and Passive. She will look to harass you whenever you go for CS. Avoid letting her get free harass on you by keeping your distance and staying at max range at all times. If she does use her Q and it hits, do not walk forward for some time.\n \nAkali has no built-in sustain and she has poor base stats. She is also melee. Use this to your advantage to trade with her early on and harassing her whenever she goes for CS. A good time to trade with her is when she has used/missed her Q.\n \nAkali\u2019s W is important for trading and her survivability, but it has a long cooldown. Trade and harass her whenever it's down."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks has the ability to solo the Dragon at a very early level. Take this into consideration and keep vision on Dragon at all times.\n\nIf a predicted Fiddlesticks suddenly stops having Tremors on Rek\u2019Sai\u2019s Tremor Sense W, it is highly likely that he is channeling his Rand you should run out of the potential Fiddlesticks\u2019 R immediately.\n\nFiddlesticks has predictable gank patterns pre-6 which can easily be mitigated with wards in the river. Furthermore, Rek\u2019Sai\u2019s good counter ganks can be used to easily punish an immobile Fiddlesticks if he attempts a gank.\n\nAvoid trying to invade Fiddlesticks unless you know where he is. You can\u2019t win 1v1\u2019s against him as he has many disengage options and can easily escape an invade. Try to steal away his camps when he is somewhere else on the map."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Can\u2019t gank efficiently till she hits level six. This is because she has no form of reliable engage and hence needs to powerfarm.\n\nShe is very reliant on her items in order to frontline during the late game fights. If she is setback early on, she won\u2019t be able to last for too long after diving into the enemy team.\n\nShe is very vulnerable when her Ultimate t is down. She is quite prone to ganks when she is laning as her a doesn\u2019t provide her with that much mobility."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Keep a constant eye on your mana pool. Cassiopeia has short cooldowns (overall) and it\u2019s easy to spam them. \n\nExtended trades work in Cassiopeia\u2019s favour. Her damage does stack up so try to go for extended trades around your E.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R. It is a good all-in tool and good to setup/deny ganks. Make sure you get close to the enemy to ensure you\u2019re able to land it."}
{"text": "As lucian, After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nUse your mid-game power spike to look for aggressive plays and all-ins on enemies who try to stop you from split pushing or ones that are moving around the map alone."}
{"text": "As yone, Yone will get two points in his Ultimate R at level 11, which will be a massive peak of power for him. It is mainly because he can easily remove enemies during this game phase, especially from the fog of the war. At level 9, Yone will have his first maximum ability. This means that his trades will improve considerably, and he will quickly snowball the game if he manages to get a few dead early. Yone is really good during the team fights because he can choose several targets with his Ultimate R. This will make it very important for the enemy to keep an eye on him, otherwise he can easily Ultimate R several people from the fog of the war."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Yasuo is really strong once he has 100% crit chance. Thanks to his Passive, he can get to this stage quite quickly.\n\nOnce Yasuo is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his kill pressure increases. You should play respectfully whenever his Ultimate R is up as he can quite easily kill you.\n\nYasuo is really good in team fights if he is picked in a team with multiple knock-ups. Avoid grouping too closely otherwise, he could get a 5 person Ultimate R off."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Gwen will be split pushing in the mid-game. You can use the numbers advantage to take her down or start a team fight on her team while she is elsewhere on the map.\n\nShe will be hard to kill in team fights, so you\u2019ll need to play around her W to make it easier for you to shut her down.\n\nHealing reduction will be very useful in team fights as Gwen will get a lot of sustain.\n"}
{"text": "As naafiri, At the end of the game, flank the enemy and stay close to your teammates. You should look to go with them in the team fights at the end of the game. Continue looking for picks on the enemy Support while they go to the room alone in the game at the end of the game. This is especially true when the goals are about to spawn. Focus on team fights with your allies, and avoid breaking up too much or they will collapse and you will lose the fight."}
{"text": "As katarina, Once she gets 2 points in her Ultimate R, she will be able to do a lot of damage to the enemies in a short time. This means that enemy squishies will be in grave danger.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will increase her damage and poke in the game, which will make it very hard for her laner to deal with her.\n\nShe is outstanding in team fights due to her Ultimate R and Q > r combo. It is over for the enemy team if she manages to get a flank on them.        "}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Kassadin is very weak in early play. Try to exploit this to win an advance and prevent him from taking the card. Giving him a difficult start will reduce his scale. Once Kassadin has his Ultimate k, he will be able to trade more frequently and also escape danger. At this point, his death pressure also increases. Kassadin is a game monster later and once level 16, he will be very slippery thanks to his Ultimate k and short cooldowns. Try and finish before having a chance to reach level 16."}
{"text": "Against morgana, If you can avoid Morgana in a Q escarmouche, you should all of it as she doesn't have much else to offer pre-6. She is easy to kill if you can avoid her Q. Morgana will waste often early. Keep this in mind and try to counter her ganks when possible. Her objective control in the early game is pretty good. Keep the goals watched, or take them before she has the chance to do it herself."}
{"text": "As talon, Talon has the highest amount of first bloods in the game. His early kill pressure is insane!\n\nTalon has great roaming potential thanks to his E. This allows him to jump over walls and move around the map quickly.\n\nIn the later parts of the game, Talon can pick up extra kills on enemies who are walking around the map alone. As he deals a lot of burst damage, he can kill them quickly before running to safety."}
{"text": "Against janna, If she does, try to ambush her by camping in a bush near the Baron or the Dragon. In team fights, Janna will try to use her e and d to hit / knockup enemies to delay their engagement. If you have to go to the enemy to kill them, be prepared to flank side to make it harder for her to anticipate your movements. For AD champions, invest in the call of an executor when Janna is ahead. This will reduce her ability to heal and protect her allies."}
{"text": "As kennen, Focus on farming and scaling. Kennen needs time to come online and if you go for a bad trade or fall behind, you\u2019re going to struggle to be useful later on.\n\nIf your bot lane rotates to the top side after getting the first tower, rotate to the bottom lane and start to farm there instead.\n\nUse your range and energy advantage to gain an early lead. Try to harass the enemy champion as often as possible."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, At level 9, Miss Fortune would\u2019ve maxed her t. Her poke and damage output will be quite high and obnoxious to deal with.\n\nHer level 6 is quite strong, even with an AP build. Leave her Ultimate e as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter Miss Fortune has completed her first component item, her damage output and poke in lane will increase dramatically."}
{"text": "Against samira, Post 6, she can't use her Ultimate R unless she's completely stacked on the Samira Style points is an incredibly mobile champion. To reduce her mobility and increase your survival, try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will make it impossible for her to use her E aggressively. If you're a weak ADC in the beginning of the game, definitely keep the wave closer to your side of the map. Playing around her W in the way is crucial as it can block projectiles (automatic attacks)."}
{"text": "As garen, As it lacks any form of varied engagement potential, it is really weak against the various enemy champions. It counts on the side of the enemy team of the side line. If the enemy team manages to put the right vision, the game plan of Garens will collapse and it will be useless especially if your team managed to place it behind early. Due to it having several constructions, the efficiency of Garens can vary from one game to the next. If he decides to go for the complete AD construction when his team lacks a front line, he has not been able to do anything if it is handed over. This should be a good signal for the enemy Jungler/team to camp whenever possible."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, As soon as Mordekaiser activates his W, disengage as he will block the damage you deal to him if you continue to fight him.\n\nMordekaiser is quite immobile. If you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map, you will force him to overextend for farm. You can then capitalise on this and get assistance from your Jungler.\n\nOnce Mordekaiser hits level 6, his kill pressure in lane grows. Keep this in mind and be wary with your positioning when low as he may try and catch you out with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah will want to delay a team fight for as long as possible while she pokes you down with her Q. Try and force a fight as soon as you spot her.\n\nAvoid splitting up and playing alone. Taliyah\u2019s Ultimate R will allow her to pick off enemies who are alone or isolated without assistance. Do not push up too far forward if you have no one nearby.\n\nTaliyah has good pick potential with her C. If you don\u2019t know where Taliyah is in the mid-game, do not walk around Summoners Rift alone and avoid areas without vision as she may be looking to set up a surprise attack."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ezreal\u2019s first power spike is when he picks up Sheen. His Q damage will increase substantially and he will look to constantly poke. \n \nOnce Ezreal has completed his Manamune and upgraded it to Muramana, his damage output and sustain will be much higher.\n \nWhenever Ezreal has his E, he is much safer and harder to kill. Try to abuse the cooldown whenever you can."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Lissandra is very good at level 6 while her Ultimate R increases her death pressure. She can also easily install her Jungler with her Ultimate R. Lissandra reaches her real potential when the team fights as its Ultimate R and W are both AOE. Her Passive can also wreak havoc in a team fight. Once Lissandra has finished her first element, her clear wave will be very strong."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Hecarim is a strong duel in early play and will try to kill you in solo early on. Do not underestimate his early game damage as it will usually come out ahead. Look what the suggestor Spells Hecarim has taken. If he took Ignite, he will seek to play ultra-aggressive early to get killed. If you are weak, don't try and trade with him as he will end up with you with Ignite. Hecarim has good ability to take Dragon and can the solo early thanks to his AOE curing his W and short cooldown h. Make sure you have the vision on the Dragon at any time. If you can, try to take it away from him."}
{"text": "As varus, When you get your items, you should have a really easy time to blow up enemies with ease. Set some deep quarters to facilitate long-range Qs on the enemy team. Your E and W will be really beneficial during real fights like the Wounds Grievous and the slow should disturb the enemy heavily. This will make your team win the fights easily. A defensive element can help you a lot in this matchup, especially if you go for an AP build. Just make sure you don't stay too far from your allies."}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Vladimir is at his lowest level in the early game. Try your hardest to put it behind to make it less heinous in the middle and end of the game. At level 9, Vladimir would have maximized Q. It has a short cooldown and deals a lot of damage. Avoid letting it use on you too. Vladimir is really good in the late game and in team fights. Try to finish the game as quickly as you can so it is unable to peak."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Evelynn starts to be harder to play at the end of the game because the teams will regroup. It will be harder for her to choose targets when they are stacked like 5. At the end of the game, the enemy champions will start building defensive elements. It will be harder for you to shoot a squishy target. If you are ahead, no matter how much enemy team groups you can choose people with ease. Just don't commit to do so and make sure you always throw your ultimate R to escape."}
{"text": "As leesin, He is a very dominant early game laner who can quickly snowball and put his enemy behind.\n\nLee has a high skill ceiling which means if you put a lot of effort into him, you will find great success with him.\n\nHis level 6 power spike is very strong and he can easily get kills in his own lane, or rotate around the map and get kills elsewhere."}
{"text": "As lucian, Strong power peak at level two that allows him to throw an enemy down with his E, Q combo. This combined with his Passive and Invocative Spells can easily get him killed on a squishy target. Very good clear wave with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This makes him gain the really fast priority and he also helps secure goals with his Jungler. After six, he can practically an enemy with his combo while repositioning simultaneously with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to avoid the ganks with ease."}
{"text": "As vladimir, Focus on farming and getting as much gold and XP as possible. You need time and gold before you\u2019re able to come online and deal damage.\n\nYour champion is incredibly weak in the early game. Focus on farming and avoid fighting with the enemy until you\u2019ve got an item behind you.\n\nAfter your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. Do not fight anyone unless you have an advantage over them. Continue to get XP and gold."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain\u2019s early game is rather weak. If you\u2019re playing as an early game champion, try to get an early advantage to reduce his scaling.\n\nHis Root E will only trigger on the first enemies he hits on its return. Stand near your Caster Minions and walk forwards when he throws it out so the minions get CC\u2019d and not you.\n\nAt level 6, his kill pressure and survivability increases. Unless you have the advantage, disengage as soon as he activates his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against viktor, Viktors first power spike is once he has hit level 6. His Ultimate m will give him extra kill pressure in lane and he will start to play slightly more aggressive.\n\nHis abilities will be stronger with every upgrade.\n\nOnce Viktor has completed his first item, and upgraded his y, he will be able to clear the minion waves very fast and keep you pushed under your tower."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Stay with your Support throughout the mid-game. If you move away from them, you will be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you\u2019re always near at least 1 ally.\n\nGroup and stay with your team at all times. Do not split push or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against camille, Try to stay closely together as a team when she plays against Camille so that it is very difficult for her to engage. Camille will want to lock an isolated target with her Ultimate R, but by standing close to him, this will reduce her ability to do so. Camille will often hunt vulnerable targets that are isolated by walking around the map. Stay with your team to reduce Camille's assassination attempts. In addition to regrouping closely, Camille cannot easily run back to the enemy. Instead, she will try to flank the side."}
{"text": "As jax, Its scaling is unrivalled and it does really well in duels due to its E and Q. The more the game goes, the more dangerous it becomes and can practically kill anyone regardless of the health they are. The E makes it take less damage from AoE abilities. This is really beneficial to him during the battles of full teams. In addition, the E CC also acts as a really good initiation tool for his team. His Passive allows him to relentlessly divide the thrust. This can be extremely useful when the Jax=s team is behind and cannot win a fair team fight. His Q allows him to escape from the attempts of collapse with ease."}
{"text": "As zyra, As this is a poke matchup, you mustn\u2019t let Zyra push you into your tower otherwise you will struggle to survive. Try to match Zyra's pushing power by auto-attacking minions and dodging their poke.\n\nTry and track Zyra's Ultimate cooldown post 6. It is important to do this as you don\u2019t want to be caught out by Zyra's superior damage post 6.\n\nIt\u2019s very important that you hit level 2 at the same time as Zyra. If you\u2019re not going to, back off slightly so they can\u2019t all-in you as soon as they get the level up.\n\nKeep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them after they\u2019ve used an ability as they cannot use it to trade back with. Zyra is less of a threat when they have an ability down."}
{"text": "Against sion, Sion can surprise targets that are walking around Summoners Rift alone by waiting in a bush and using his Q to take them down. Avoid walking in areas where you know Sion has been so its harder for you to get caught out by him.\n\nKite and disengage is Sion\u2019s biggest threat in a team fight. Try to keep him away from your team so he is unable to get a good Q knockup.\n\nAvoid grouping and fighting in the jungle as it will allow Sion to either get a really good knockup with his Q or get a really good Ultimate R off. Group together, but do not stand on top of one another so he is unable to get a multi-person knockup. "}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin can try to kick someone like the CDA in his teammates. Group closely together to make it harder for him to throw a hand in his team's arms. As Lee Sin needs to get on someone in order to kick them to his team, lock him up with CC as soon as he engages is ideal because he is rather squishy and will be unable to escape if he is chained CC. Lee Sin is really good at removing or removing isolated targets. Make sure you group closer to your team to make it harder for him to take anyone alone."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Level sixteen is a massive peak of power as it increases the defensive capabilities of its Ultimate r. Its ADC will really be safe due to the huge shield they will get. Tahm Kench will be out of the world during this phase of the game. He can peel for days for his team and get spikes on the enemy with his Q. His Q will be on a really short cooldown. This means that his potential for pick and poke will increase a lot. He should try to use the fog of war combined with his W to secure peaks on the enemy."}
{"text": "As diana, When Diana reaches near max build, she will deal an awful lot of damage to anyone who she catches out of position. \n\nAt level 16 and with 3 points in her Ultimate R, Diana\u2019s AOE damage and all-in potential will be extremely high. As teams will be grouping in the late game, she will be able to deal a lot of damage to multiple enemies at once.\n\nWhile Diana will deal a lot of damage in late game team fights, it may be harder for her to one-shot targets because enemies will start building defensive items to protect them from her burst."}
{"text": "As poppy, Level 11 is not excellent because it only gets cooling on the reduced capacity. Compared to the other Junglers, it does not bring much to the table. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow it to inflict a lot of damage to the enemies that it has managed to catch. It will also allow it to counter the enemy's escape attempts. Poppy is perfect during the middle of the game as it can inflict constant damage and can CC enemies for days. Its tankness makes it impossible for the enemy team to kill it as well."}
{"text": "As malphite, A maximum of the Ultimate h will allow Malphite to flatten large amounts of burst damage. Ennemy squishies will have a heinous moment in the game. It is solid during the end-of-game fights that his d and Ultimate h will hit like a truck now. He only has to wait for the perfect moment. According to the construction for which he is going, he will either blow up enemies on the whole map or a reliable linear front for his allies. Anyway, his goal is to enter the enemy rearline and separate the front line from the rear line."}
{"text": "As draven, Draven\u2019s early game is solid. He can out trade most bottom lane champions due to his g. You must look for fights in the early game to cash out from your Passive.\n\nDraven\u2019s level 6 power spike is powerful. His Ultimate t can be used during skirmishes, unlike some ADC\u2019s such as Caitlyn. Commit to all-ins if you have a slight lead so you can, again, cash out from your Passive.\n\nAfter Draven\u2019s first back, he will be able to out trade the enemy laners because of his g. Regardless of if the enemy ADC picked up the same items as you, you will still win a fight. A good Draven is not scared of the enemy- keep that in mind."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble deals more damage when its bar is greater than 50%. Be careful to take jobs when it is above this amount. Although, if you can lure its bar and overheat it will lack capacity damage. Once Rumble has its Ultimate, its death pressure increases. Do not underestimate its all-in potential with its Ultimate. If it uses it on you, try to step back as its Jungler could try to gank as its Ultimate is a good gank configuration."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Look for short burst trades in this matchup as much as you can. What you want to do is keep harassing enemies from the lane brush, go in and then fall back once they are knocked up.\n\nYou should have a really easy lane provided you can keep the river warded. It will keep you safe from ganks and will allow you to play the lane on your terms.\n\nRemember that your dash is your only means of escape and engage. Using it at an improper time can get you killed quickly and lose you a major fight."}
{"text": "As gragas, Your abilities will do a ton of damage now. You should focus on the explosion of the enemy rearline with your Q and Ultimate R, especially if they are joined together. Try to work with your Jungler and get spikes inside the enemy Jungle with your Ultimate R. Even the withdrawal of the enemy Support will give your team a considerable advantage when it comes to vision placements. If you are behind, just make sure you peel for your portages with your capabilities. This will help you manage all the ins of the enemy frontline while ensuring that your nourished portages can play safely."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Invest in early sustain and an early Executioner\u2019s Calling. He will try to out sustain you, so you need as many resources to equal or counter his sustain in lane.\n \nLook for fights when Fiddlesticks has an ability down. Preferably, his Q or W so he is unable to escape/ trade back with you.\n \nTry and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. Fiddlesticks is quite vulnerable to ganks and by keeping the wave near your side of the map, he will have to overextend for farm."}
{"text": "As sion, Watch the track brushes at all costs in this matchup. Sion can easily you CC from them and you won't even know about it. Keep track of its ult noise and see what track it is ruining. If it goes for another way, just get turn plates. During the fights, make sure you don't leave it to anyone. So much your ult and tankness should facilitate this and you can play the fight with relative ease.. Keep the wave near your tower. The enemy doesn't have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is a heavy farm champion and will have to absorb many wave minions and jungle camps to be useful throughout the game. His Ultimate e basically does not inflict any damage in early play. This is not good for Karthus because he only wants to use it when the enemy is super low. Meanwhile, the enemy could have already been killed by your ally, and you wouldn't get any help. Channeling your Ultimate e near an enemy champion could be very dangerous as they could interrupt the channel with CC."}
{"text": "As syndra, Try to hit both champions and minions with your Q for maximum mana efficiency in the lane. Landing it from out of vision is relatively easy as well.\n\nYour W and E will be instrumental towards your burst combo in the lane. Make sure that you don't do anything rash and use it carefully as your E is the only ability able to save you from all-ins.\n\nUnlocking your Ultimate R will be quite a milestone as you will now be able to burst enemies down with ease. Just make sure that you don't get CC'd while doing so.        "}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Another point in his Ultimate n will increase his overall damage and allow him to skirmish way more efficiently.

{"text": "As quinn, While she doesn't have a Ultimate R combat, her Ultimate R is an excellent roaming tool that can allow her to return to the line quickly and also wander around the map and help her allies. She can blow up enemies who are alone when she is in front. Look for spikes on squissy and still targets to get a lead further."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus is weak early. You can use it to your advantage to invade him and steal his camps. Stealing his camps will refuse him batteries. His ability to take Dragon is really weak early. Try to take the lens before he can gank bot lane and take it for himself. Counter ganking Nasus is pretty easy, so try to do it. Once he has entered with his W, he only really has his automatic attacks and Q to inflict damage."}
{"text": "As senna, The second point in her Ultimate R will let her deal increased damage to enemies while shielding allies. It is perfect during team fights.\n\nHer mid-game is solid. She can quickly 1 v 1 non-mobile enemy, and she can also do extremely well in team fights due to her W.\n\nThe first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let her deal a lot of damage and heal for massive amounts depending on her items.        "}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 16, Ezreal will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will do a lot of damage to anyone touched with her in the last game. When Ezreal comes to the end of his construction, he will have incredibly low cooling on all his abilities. It's good for him because he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight happens. Moreover, his E will be on a short cooling that allows him to easily escape from the skirmishes. Ezreal is awesome in the middle of the game, but he starts to fall in the last game because it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}
{"text": "As vayne, Try and stick with your Support throughout the mid-game. You\u2019re quite vulnerable and easy to kill if you\u2019re on your own. By staying with your Support, your survivability will increase.\n\nContinue picking up farm in the side lanes when no team fights are occurring, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to dish out damage in fights.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As shaco, A maxed-out Ultimate l will confer the benefits of a lower cooldown and more significant burst damage of the Shaco clone. It will let Shaco one-shot enemies if they destroy it while it is in their vicinity.\n\nHe will be dealing a lot of damage to the enemy team now, especially the squishy targets. He has the potential to one-shot low health, immobile, and squishy targets quickly now.\n\nShaco is pretty decent in team fights due to his clones and the short cooldowns on his abilities. He can quickly get rid of critical carries due to his e and set traps for the enemy team using his Ultimate l and x."}
{"text": "As zyra, More than often you can turn a gank right on its head with proper W placement along with the usage of your Q or E. Use E if the enemy ganker has some form of Movement Speed ability with which they can gap close quickly.\n\nPoking is your main power in the lane and it is really obnoxious during the early game. With your poke, you can quite easily zone the enemy laners off without even getting close to them.\n\nYour brush power is unparalleled and one rotation of your spells on an unsuspecting enemy will force them to play defensively. Don\u2019t try to play too passively and always be on the lookout to land a multi-man E."}
{"text": "As talon, Focus on getting picks around the map during this phase of the game, as you will be able to find many squishy targets roaming around.\n\nYour E should allow you to win fights way more efficiently as it makes you highly slippery and lets you catch enemies off-guard.\n\nTry to kill the enemy Jungler before taking a neutral objective. This will help you secure the objective without any hindrance, and you will have an easier time winning the game.        "}
{"text": "As ryze, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or walk away from them otherwise the enemy can try to withdraw you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Delaying the team fights while you take the damage with your base combos. Make sure to stay safe in the team fights by looking at your position and avoiding too much superextend. Ryze in the late game inflicts a lot of brilliant damage. Hide in the high traffic areas if you are ahead and look to blow someone up."}
{"text": "As chogath, At level 9, Cho\u2019Gath will max out his first ability. Generally speaking, this ability is his s. \n\nAt level 11, Cho\u2019Gath should put the second point in his Ultimate t. His kill pressure increases dramatically at this time.\n\nHe should be stronger during the mid-game as he will have earned more defensive stats thanks to using his Feast t on minions and champions."}
{"text": "Against ashe, Catch Ashe out of position when she goes to ward. You can then look to take Baron or the Dragon while she is dead.\n\nKeep a constant eye on your champion's movements in the mid and late game as Ashe will usually throw out her Ultimate w \u201crecklessly\u201d in attempts to start the fight. Dodge it and then capitalise on the cooldown. \n\nBe prepared to back away from an objective if Ashe uses her k to scout vision. If your team is spotted, the enemy will try to contest the objective which may lead to your team throwing the game."}
{"text": "As bard, If Bard decides to move away from his ally and consider playing more aggressively in the way. In the early stages of the game, keep the wave closer to your side of the track, as it offers a safer position for you."}
{"text": "As zilean, His QW Q combo can help him to stun a group of enemies that is very beneficial in near-quarter combat. His ladders are high enough so that he can do a lot of damage through this combo. His Ultimate t, when used correctly, is one of the most odious and overcharged abilities in the game. This combined with his p can make one of his doors almost uncatchable and uncontrollable. His p allows him to guarantee a QW Q hit on a specified target. This can be very beneficial in setting up a death brush before a major objective fight."}
{"text": "As diana, Her all-in potential post-six is really strong. This allows her to burst down any squishy target she manages to land her Q on, making it very hard for the enemy squishies to push up in their lanes.\n\nUnlike her counterparts, Diana has built-in tankiness which allows her to all-in with her Q, t, and Ultimate R combo quite easily. This is highly valuable when trying to take out a group of three or more champions, especially when the enemy team is unaware of your position.\n\nPossibly one of the best flankers in the game. She can take out the enemy backline almost instantaneously during a team fight if she is left unchecked. Besides, if she happens to get caught, her tankiness and defensive items will keep her alive for quite some time."}
{"text": "Against shaco, Shaco\u2019s first major power spike is at level 6 when he unlocks his Ultimate l. His clone can be very sneaky, and it can deal a lot of damage if you fight 1v1.\n\nAt level 9, Shaco would\u2019ve maxed his first ability. His ability to trade with you in the lane will increase and he will be a little more obnoxious. \n\nWhen Shaco\u2019s completed his first component item, his trading power in the lane will increase and he will be stronger in the 1v1. Unless you equal his damage, think twice before looking to fight him."}
{"text": "As quinn, Unfortunately, Quinn doesn\u2019t exactly spike at level 11 like a lot of other champions.\n\nAt level 9, Quinn will max out her first ability. This is a significant spike for her as this abilities damage output will be much higher and she will be a lot stronger.\n\nQuinn is quite strong during the mid-game. She will be able to blow up overextended enemies who are walking around Summoners Rift alone."}
{"text": "As xayah, The late-game monster if her team peels for her. She will want to close early and try to get some murders early on what will allow her to snowball easily. Her W makes deceptive damage very early, especially when paired with Rakan. This ability when combined with her Q, E, and an important CC Support, can allow her to get a huge lead in the way. Her ultimate R can allow her to escape situations in which other ADCs won't survive. It also gives her the agency to root the entire enemy team with a naughty use of her Flash and E."}
{"text": "Against lulu, In team fights, try to catch Lulu out of position or lock her down with CC. If you can take her down first, her ability to protect her ADC and her carries will be lessened. If you can\u2019t kill her, you might be able to force herself to self-cast her Ultimate R. \n\nLulu will often go to ward alone. You can look to ambush her and take her down while she\u2019s isolated and then start a team fight with her team while she\u2019s dead. \n\nFor AD champions, invest in an Executioner's Calling when Lulu and her team is ahead. This will reduce her healing and shielding capability on her allies."}
{"text": "As darius, Use Darius\u2019 early game aggression to get a lead in the lane. Gaining a significant health or kill lead over the enemy will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nAlways go for extended trades as often as you can on Darius. Thanks to your Passive, you\u2019ll always come out ahead in most cases.\n\nUse your level 6 power spike to get kills in lane and start to snowball. Your Ultimate e can be used as an execute, so it should help you get a lead."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim's h will be maximized once it reaches level 9, which will allow it to flatten a lot of constant damage when it is in the middle of the enemy team. It will also allow it to support itself due to its objects and runes. Like the best laner, it will be much more tankier and will also be able to peel for its team. Hecarim's Ultimate will be more robust now because it has two points at level 11. This means that it can use it frequently, which results in more dead enemies wears."}
{"text": "Against viego, In the team fights, as soon as Viego returns, try the CC and make it burst first. He is quite vulnerable to the CC and if you can kill him before he pulls his combo, the enemy will lose on a lot of damage. Keep track of who he can change at the start and during a fight. Try to play accordingly all his potential new abilities. Do not group too closely in the team fights if he stole a strong title as champion."}
{"text": "As ahri, Once it's done (or during farming), you can use the minion wave as bait and set up death brushes around it. It will allow you to catch ignorant enemies with your E and shoot them down before they can react. Team fights should be similar in mid-game. Always look for ways to flank the enemy and pull out one or two members of their backline. It will also act as a signal for your team to engage, and if they don't commit, you can always use your last ultimate charge to get out. The fog of the war is your friend and you should use this to set up death brushes with your team. This works especially well when a major fight is going to take place for a neutral goal like the Baron. Also, try to take fights in closed areas like the Jungle, as it will allow you to hit several people with your Q."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, At level 9, Heimerdinger will max out his Q.  The damage these Turrets will deal to the enemy in the lane and in team fights will be quite high.\n\nLevel 11 is also a great power spike for Heimerdinger because all of his basic abilities will be a lot stronger when they become empowered by his Ultimate R.\n\nHe excels in team fights and can control large parts of the maps: depending on which Ultimate R he uses in the team fight."}
{"text": "Against illaoi, Test of the E Spirit is essential when it comes to trading. Dodger this ability is the key because it will reduce its trading power. Make sure that you are still standing behind at least 1 minon. Do not stay inside the minion wave although as Illaoi can use its Q to push the wave and push you at the same time if you are standing in it. If you have been hit by its E and escaped from the area, do not kill all the Tentaceles. Stand next to one of them so that another can not spawn. Try to freeze the wave closer to your side of the card. Illaoi is weak early and will try to freeze the wave and then you will zone away from the minions when it is stronger. By keeping the wave closer, you will limit its capacity to the farm and scale."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Avoid fighting in the jungle as this will allow Maokai to get a good Ultimate R. Moreover, avoid fighting around neutral goals like the Dragon or Baron as well. When you sit, make sure no one on your team is too far ahead that Maokai can isolate them and catch them out of position with his W. As it might be difficult for Maokai to fight as a team, he can try to flank on the side to make it easier to get to the enemy. He can also use his Ultimate R on the side to CC all your team."}
{"text": "As sion, Your goal in the early game is to play safe, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy laner. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online.\n\nOnce you have quite a few levels under your belt, you should look for short favourable trades. As you\u2019re not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in lane."}
{"text": "As jhin, Once Jhin gets two points in his Ultimate R, he secures the shots with ease and helps his team catch up with the enemies. Damage will also be increased. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to clear the minion waves with ease, and the damage inflicted on the champions will be really high. Jhin's damage capacity will be really high during the middle of the game. He can blow the squishes with his abilities and 4th shot. He will just have to make sure that he can kite around the tanks."}
{"text": "Against belveth, Her first major power spike is at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Her skirmishing power increases after this level.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger she will be thanks to her Passive as she can unlock unlimited stacks.\n\nSimilarly, her attack speed can become extremely high in the late game. Try and end the game early so she cannot get so much attack speed.\n"}
{"text": "As ekko, Play safe for the first few levels. While Ekko\u2019s early game is strong, you need to remain healthy so you can look for an all-in after you have more levels under your belt.\n\nEkko has strong roaming potential and is a strong skirmisher. Get priority in your lane and then look to roam and assist your allies.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate W. It is a strong tool that can help win fights and outplay the enemy. Always keep this ability in mind when you\u2019re fighting the enemy."}
{"text": "As nilah, Her W blocks auto-attacks and enhanced auto-attack abilities. This includes abilities like Twisted Fate\u2019s W.\n\nYour Passive helps you gain XP advantages over the enemy laners, which can help you hit power spikes before them.\n\nHer E gives Nillah 2 dashes. This is good for her as she can quickly get in and out of skirmishes.\n"}
{"text": "As briar, A lot of support in fighting, especially if the enemy does not get the reduction of healing. You have a lot of built-in CC that is great on a Jungler. Post 6, you can use your R Ultimate for gank your allies from afar."}
{"text": "As twitch, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. A good player will play around their Ultimate as often as it comes. You have to counter their deganking pressure by doing the same thing. He will beganking much sooner. Make sure to apply as much pressure as you can to match his first ganks."}
{"text": "Against brand, You can use it to your advantage by trying to invade it at the beginning of the game if you are strong. Watch for the damage of the surprise brand during roaming around the card. Thanks to its combo E Q W, it can lock you up and blow you up if it attacks an undeserved bush. Do not let yourself be caught by the amount of damage of the surprise brand that it can inflict."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Stay together with your team. Do not leave your ADCs, otherwise the enemy will capitalize on the fact that you are not there to protect your ADC. Peel for your carts in the team fights. After using your g, retreat and protect your allies and focus the closest champion. Look for choices with your Ultimate e. If you can catch someone when the enemy is not organized, you can force a team fight or a goal afterwards."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Once Caitlyn has a few points in its Q, it can constantly keep the enemy pushed in its turn as its Q offers it a lot of free wave. When paired with poke support, the enemy should never be able to leave their turn. This will also lead to a huge gold lead, due to the plates of the tower. After Caitlyn the first return, it will pick up its first component. This will increase its potential of poke and trading in the track. This will also make it a huge threat if it has a better first element than the ADC enemy. Caitlyn the level 6 is pretty good, but it does not have a Ultimate R fight. This means that it cannot use its Ultimate R during a skirmish. However, it is an execution and can be used when it is in a safe position and not in immediate danger."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Look for regular burst trades with your g and e. It should allow you to easily get away without taking a lot of damage in return.\n\nYour Ultimate e should help you massively when it comes to dealing with any sort of mobile enemy. Just make it a point to commit to an all-in when you use the ability.\n\nRoam if possible, especially if one of the enemy laners is overextended. It will allow you to get an insurmountable lead and will tilt the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against yone, Yone is better at trading once he unlocks his Ultimate R as it offers him tons of kill pressure.\n\nOnce Yone gets 100% critical strike chance, he will dish out lots of damage. Remember that his Passive gives him double crit chance.\n\nYone is very good in team fights if he is able to get a good Ultimate R off. Remember to stay apart when possible."}
{"text": "As maokai, Your Ultimate R will be on a short cooldown during this phase of the game. Make sure you use it regularly to catch off enemies and get frequent kills on the enemy.\n\nThe fog of war is going to help you a lot during this phase of the game. Prepare some brushes with your E saplings and just all-in the enemy as soon as they come close to it.\n\nYou will be very powerful during this game phase, and your tankiness will be really high. Just make sure that you don't leave your backline unguarded, else you will have a hard time winning the game."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Pantheon is a very strong early game champion, so you need to play this lane passively and use resources when necessary.\n\nAt level 6, you get a massive power spike over Pantheon, since his R is not a real power spike to Pantheon. Use the pressure it provides to threaten all-ins on him.\n\nWhen Pantheon engages on you, use your abilities and then AA him until his abilities are back, then run back to your tower.\n\nPantheon will likely try to use his Q on every opportunity that gets presented to him. You can tank its damage early on with your Passive if you need to."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Destroy his turrets as much as possible with your basic attacks and abilities. \n\nTry not to let Heimerdinger get early turret plates and gold by matching his poke and pushing power.\n\nYour level 6 is going to be stronger than his. But you need to poke him down first if you want to kill his at level 6.\n\nThis is going to be a farming/ poke matchup. Focus on poking him down and farming. Just don\u2019t let him poke you back."}
{"text": "As veigar, He will have a lot of Passive stacks during this phase of the game. This scaling is infinite, which means that Veigar can pretty much one-shot full health squishy targets.\n\nHis n will be on a very short cooldown during this point in the game. He will be able to secure a lot of picks, especially around choke points.\n\nOnce his Ultimate R gets maxed out, he will execute enemies with ease. Any enemy who gets hit by his e will be within Ultimate R kill range of Veigar."}
{"text": "Against sivir, Sivir is very strong once she has tons of writing. This makes her strong enough during the middle and end of the game. Once Sivir unlocks her Ultimate R, her death pressure increases but not in a usual 2v2 fight. As it is a utility tool, it allows her to chase you down or engage hard with her Jungler. Expect that she gets ganks post 6. Sivir is really good in the team fights that her Ultimate R can help her team catch enemies who are overheard or out of position."}
{"text": "As zac, Use the track brushes to mark the impact on the enemy lantern whenever possible. Go for quick exchanges and then step back. Once you get your first element, you should be able to extend the duration of your fights. Just make sure you keep the river you're going to getganked differently. Getting your Ultimate R will allow you to be part of many team fights. Focus on zoning the squishier targets off during the skirmishes."}
{"text": "Against lulu, In team fights, try to catch Lulu out of position or lock her up with CC. If you can shoot her first, her ability to protect her portages will be diminished. If you can't kill her, you might be able to force yourself to launch her Ultimate R. For AD champions, invest in the call of an executor when Lulu and her team are ahead. This will reduce her ability to heal and protect her allies."}
{"text": "Against belveth, If you can't invade her early, steal her camps when she shows up elsewhere on the map. Refusing these camps will prevent her from getting batteries. Counter gank her whenever you can. After she has used her basic capabilities, she doesn't have much to offer. If you have CC and are good in 1v1s or 2v2s, you should have an easy time against manipulation."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Do not group or fight inside the jungle as it will allow Rumble to get a good Ultimate b off. By fighting in the open, it will be harder for him to get a 5 person Ult b.\n\nNever try to take an objective like Baron or the Dragon if Rumble is alive and kicking. As you will be quite close together inside the pit, you are allowing him to land a devastating b on your whole team.\n\nRumble is prone to disengage. As soon as he uses his Ultimate b, try to disengage or reposition so it\u2019s harder for him to deal follow up damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "As draven, When Draven maxes his g at level 9, his damage output will be incredibly high when trading with the enemy. It will also be on a shorter cooldown which is helpful if you\u2019ve recently dropped an Axe g.\n\nDepending on how far or behind Draven is, he may be very strong in the mid-game or incredibly weak. It is vital that he doesn\u2019t overextend or get killed at the start of the fight to ensure he can dish out as much damage as possible.\n\nRegardless of how ahead or behind he is, Draven will have a lot of damage in the mid-game thanks to his g."}
{"text": "As ryze, Focus on agriculture and get as much gold and XP as possible. You need time and gold before you can come online and inflict damage. Your champion is incredibly weak in early play. Focus on agriculture and avoid fighting with the enemy until you have an article behind you. After your bot track moved to the middle track, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. Fight no one unless you have an advantage over them. Continue to get XP and gold."}
{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze is at his weakest at the beginning of the game. Try to abuse him by looking for an early all-in to force him to remember. Ryze does not point to level 6 as his Ultimate R is a utility tool. Use this to your advantage to win an all-in level 6. You should try to finish the game as quickly as you can that Ryze becomes stronger and stronger than the game goes."}
{"text": "As brand, At level 11, Brand will put a second point in his Ultimate R. His damage output and kill pressure will heavily intensify. As long as he is playing around his Ultimate R, he should be a real threat during the mid-game when it comes to getting ganks off.\n\nDuring the mid game, Brand should\u2019ve completed a couple items. In order to make the most of his kit, he should try to poke the enemy down before committing to a team fight in order to increase his chances of winning the fight.\n\nOverall, Brand\u2019s level 9 power spike is very good for him as he would\u2019ve maxed his W which allows him to clear his jungle more effectively and also dish out more damage. He should also find it somewhat easier to secure objectives like the Dragon or Rift Herald."}
{"text": "As annie, You are weak against long-range poke because of your spell range being low to moderate (depending on ability). You are not as effective if you are not able to accumulate an advance on your enemies early. Whatever the extra speed of movement as your offers E, Annie has little or no escape form. If you are stretched without your E to protect yourself, you will be an easy target."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Make sure you are always on the side of the map that the next major objective is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show yourself, the enemy will take the objective for free.\n\nLook to take down the enemy carries. Focus on the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them on your other frontline champions.\n\nEven though you are a laner, you can easily take down the Baron or the Dragon on your own. What you will want to do is try to sneak them out from the enemy team while your team is busy trying to distract the enemy."}
{"text": "As malphite, Malphite will have several elements during this stage of the game. This allows it to do a lot of damage (if it goes for AP) or absorb a lot of damage if it goes for the construction of the tank. At level 11, Malphite will have two points in its Ultimate h. This will reduce the cooling of the capacity and will allow Malphite to have more impact. It is perfect in team fighting because it can completely delimit the enemy due to the threat of its Ultimate h. Its capabilities will also allow it to bring additional effects and utility to a team fight."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Powerfarm in the mid-game. You need to earn as much gold and XP as possible so you can level up quickly.\n\nAvoid fighting too much in the mid-game. It\u2019s better for you to only fight when it\u2019s going to work in your favour. Focus on farming rather than fighting.\n\nSplit up and farm the side waves once your ADC and Support have rotated to the mid lane."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Neeko is good in team fighting thanks to her Ultimate R. Disengagement as soon as you see her Ultimate R channel. Once Neeko reaches level 6, her death pressure increases. During her struggle, keep in mind that she can throw her Ultimate R and inflict damage and CC you. Once Neeko reaches level 2, she can go for short exchanges with her Q and E. Try and stay at maximum distance at all times so she can't burst you."}
{"text": "As maokai, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "Against graves, Only look to fight Graves if there are lots of allied minions in lane so you can use them to block his auto-attacks.\n \nGraves auto attacks are not always effective as monsters/minions/towers block his damage and consume a bullet. Stay behind a monster or minion to avoid his auto-attack damage. When fighting around the Scuttle Crab, make sure it\u2019s in between you and him so it blocks an auto. \n \nWhen duelling Graves, try and stand away from terrain as he will use it to his advantage to make his l explode quicker."}
{"text": "As quinn, Use your Q to target both enemies and minions whenever possible. This will be extremely effective mana and will allow you to send the enemy scurry out of the way. After six, you should be able to gank and wander around a lot. Take a few detours and see if you can help your sideways out. Use your E very carefully as it can easily get you killed if you use it at an inappropriate time."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine has low basic statistics and is quite vulnerable in early play. Play safe and avoid taking damage to increase your survival. Seraphine lacks an escape tool. This reduces her chances of escaping skill strokes and makes it more difficult for her to escape from an all-in enemy. The shield and cure you get from your W is missing enough, especially in early play. Do not rely on it to save you or your ADC life."}
{"text": "Against malphite, When playing as a ranged Support, try to use your range advantage to harass and poke him down. A good time to harass him is when he walks forward in attempts to get last hits for his warding quest.\n\nThe shield from Malphites Passive offers more security in lane. Try to poke and harass him as often as possible so he is unable to get the shield and protect himself.\n\nAt level 6, Malphite\u2019s kill pressure in lane can be obnoxious. Try and keep him low so it is risky for him to engage. If you have any movement abilities that can be used to dodge, do not use them unless his Ultimate h is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As leesin, Before invading, make sure that you have your passive stacked so that you can win the trade. If they invade you, be ready to fight, but only do so if your passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just step back. Post 6, they win the 1v1 as they are stronger when their Ultimate is in place."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine is an easy-to-learn champion. You don't need to spend so much time learning it compared to someone like Akali or Camille. She has a lot of CC thanks to her Passive, E and Ultimate R. She also has a healing and shield with her W. This makes her a great utility champion. Her Ultimate R has the potential to hit the entire enemy team. The more you hit, the more he will go. If you are able to get a good Ultimate Roff, you will increase your chances of winning the team fight."}
{"text": "As irelia, Irelia is extremely strong when her Passive is stacked. It is then that she should go for a meaningful fight because he will ensure a massive victory for her as long as she has a target to self-attack. Bonus survival points if she can Q to minions and reset the ability. The first element will help Irelia massively in this way. It will strengthen her duel potential and increase her survival. It will be very beneficial when her Passive is stacked completely. Level 6 is a significant peak of power where Irelia can start to dictate the pace of this track. Her opponent will have to be very careful because Irelia can decimate them with his Ultimate R and Q if they are hit by the initial Ultimate R launch."}
{"text": "As rammus, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall behind in the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure to continue growing! As you are a Jungler, you must try to secure each Drake during the middle of the game. Get them and secure the Dragon soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game. Look for choices with your team. If you can choose someone, make the call for Baron or Dragon to continue your lead."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Don't fight in the late part unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available because you'll miss a lot of potential pressure to kill. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooling time in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your maneuvers to keep them alive longer. If your allies die quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Keep going until you hit level 3. Once you do that, start ganking when possible. Just ensure that you don't get detected onwards beforehand, though.\n\nUse your y very carefully as that ability can quickly get you a lead if appropriately used. Also, counter-gank the enemy as much as you can.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate n, you should have a higher impact on team fights. Make sure that you target high-priority champions when possible."}
{"text": "As xerath, Unparalleled poke with his p and 2. His 2 slow makes it much easier for him to be able to land his p and r on his opponents.\n\nHis r is a stun, which can be game changing if it lands on the proper target. It also gives Xerath some form of self peel as he doesn\u2019t want enemy champions on his face.\n\nHis 2 slow can also help him immensely in team fights. He can set-up opportunities for his team to land their crowd control on the 2 slowed enemy champion/"}
{"text": "As pantheon, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. Your level 6 is much higher than theirs. Look at gank every time your Ultimate is up. Brand has good objective control, so prioritize to take these goals when you can. It will be gloved much sooner. Make sure to apply as much pressure as you can to match its early ganks."}
{"text": "As kayle, Try to abuse your range advantage to get an early health advance. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early to force them to lie down for the farm and XP. When you try to poke, target your abilities so they hit the minion wave and the enemy at the same time. Once they are level 6, they get stronger than you and it will be harder for you to run against them."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Miss Fortune can melt the enemy health bars with her t. This can often give her a huge early play advantage. Her Ultimate e is very strong in team fights. Getting a good Ultimate e Off could lead your team to win the game. It's just important that you throw it away from a safe and out of immediate danger. A lot of poke in the way with its t and t. This can give her a lot of pressure in the way itself and let her tyrant the enemy go down with ease."}
{"text": "As viego, Viego can steal the life of his enemies that can allow him to escape danger. As it becomes unstoppable, it can allow him to avoid incoming damage. Viego is a fun and rewarding champion to play thanks to his Passive and his Ultimate R. Expect to hang on to him quite quickly. Viego has a high skill ceiling. This means more effort than you put in him, the better you will be on him."}
{"text": "Against garen, Garen offers a surprising amount of damage in early play. Stay at the maximum range to make it harder for him to get an early murder or go on to you and kill you. At level 6, Garen will have access to his Ultimate R that can be used to execute enemies. Do not fight it when weak, and certainly remember if you are below 50% of health as he could look for a business. It is better to be sure rather than try to fight and give him a murder. Once Garen has finished his first article, he will be more heinous and seek to exchange more and more. Keep this in mind and do not commit to fight with him alone."}
{"text": "As vex, Always look at your positioning at level 6. Its level 6 is stronger so it can easily kill you if it lands its 6. Post 6, focus on the winding and match its clear wave. This will reduce its chances of pushing you into your lap and getting a gold lead. Standing outside the minion wave at any time. This will make it harder to push you and poke at the same time. Try to stay at maximum range and poke from a distance. Apart from its Q and Ultimate, its Q and R are not very high, so she will be unable to hit you with them."}
{"text": "As riven, You will need the h h as many times as you can before you try to engage in a fight. This way you will be able to take Riven quickly. Make sure you keep CC'ing and slow down as much as possible. Riven will not be able to do as much as its set is based on mobility. You will want to take it down as quickly as you can in this matchup. The best thing will be to take it before a major fight. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy does not have some sort of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As lucian, Lucian's level 2 is a decent power spike as it allows him to go for a devastating all-in combo. The damage dealt is relatively high, and he can quite quickly kill the enemy with multiple combo rotations.\n\nLevel six is a significant powerspike, especially when Lucian is against an immobile carry. He should have an easy time clearing waves with it as well if he needs to recall.\n\nThe first item will be a massive power spike for Lucian as it allows him to deal a lot of damage. It will give him an inherent advantage, especially if he can capitalize on his level two power spike.        "}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is perfect during this stage because team fights often happen, which gives him multiple targets to land on his abilities. As a result, she carries tons of damage while healing in a major fight. Gwen will get a massive boost to his combat power at level 11 due to her Ultimate R now having two points. This is very beneficial for his team as this ability causes a lot of damage and can completely change the tide of a fight."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Nautilus has the most CC of any Champion in the Legends League. This allows him to lock enemies with ease. Good roaming potential and can push the wave, then wander on another track and help his allies. This can be really beneficial if you can't kill the enemy lantern. Super tanky and can absorb a lot of incoming damage for his team in team fighting."}
{"text": "As illaoi, Her Ultimate R has won, or done a lot of damage if it is moved or polymorphic when she initiates the Ultimate R. This can be a game change for the enemy team and will allow the enemy to easily win a fight. It is pretty small against range, especially if the port has some form of dash or edge on it, as it will allow them to easily avoid her E. Buying seriously early wounds against her can allow her enemies to win a lot of early game fights against her. This advantage will pass at the end of the match where she won, will not be able to heal much and will be easier to remove if she decides everything in the enemy."}
{"text": "Against sett, Expect Sett to flank in a team fight or use Hexflash to get over a wall and catch someone out with his E or Ultimate R. \n\nAvoid grouping to closely as it may allow Sett to get a multi-person E off which will help his team win the team fight. Splitting up slightly will be better for you in the long run.\n\nDo not walk too far forward when sieging an objective as Sett may use his Ultimate R to pick up the closest champion and launch them into their allies behind them. If you\u2019re grouped together and in line with one another, it will be harder for him to do this."}
{"text": "As shen, His tankiness will be on another level during this phase of the game. Combined with his W and Q, that will make it really hard for the enemy to kill him.\n\nAnother point in his Ultimate R will increase the shield amount and reduce the ability's cooldown. Both of them are beneficial to Shen and his team.\n\nShen is extremely decent in team fights. He can easily CC multiple enemies with his E > Flash combo and immediately defend his carries with his Ultimate R, Q, and W.        "}
{"text": "As rumble, Get to level 3 quickly and see if you can gank overextended enemies regularly. Your e and d will come in extremely handy when ganking so ensure that you use them carefully.\n\nAlways try to keep your Resource Bar half-filled. It will allow you to deal more damage during ganks and clears which can come in extremely handy in the early game.\n\nOnce you hit level 6, you should be able to increase the frequency and efficiency of your ganks. Make sure that you don't do anything which gets you caught out during the early game.        "}
{"text": "As taric, Once Taric gets 3 points in his Ultimate R, he will have a very easy time fighting with enemies. The short period of invulnerability can easily win Taric's team. Taric is pretty decent in the team fights. It is mainly because of his Ultimate R, which allows him to defend high priority targets while the enemy team takes damage. Taric is also quite tanky during this phase of the game because he will have a lot of articles now."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Ornn is also very good in the team fights that his Ultimate R could allow him to hit and CC your entire team. He will become stronger and stronger the more he gets under the belt. First, he will be more tankier with the articles, but he will also upgrade his team articles that makes them even stronger."}
{"text": "As zed, This is the point of the game where Zed will have a lot of difficulty taking enemies down. This is because enemies will buy defensive items from now. Still, Zed should try to go for isolated targets when possible.\n\nAt level 16, he will have his Ultimate R maxed out. This means that he will deal massive amounts of damage to squishier targets and will decimate anyone who has been caught out alone/\n\nZed will have really low cooldowns now, and he can deal a lot of damage due to that. This means that he will be the bane of squishier targets on the enemy team, and he can get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "Against sion, One of Sion\u2019s power spikes is at level 6 when he unlocks his Ultimate R. It offers him extra kill pressure and survivability. \n\nSion\u2019s item power spikes depend on which build he\u2019s going. He has two distinct build paths (damage and tank) and each spike at different times.\n\nLess lane dominant champions should give him some space at level 3 as Sion can do a surprising amount of damage in the right matchup."}
{"text": "As drmundo, Stay with your team at any time in the end of the game. Do not divide the thrust or run away from your team as the enemy will use the number advantage to start a team fight. Make sure you are always standing towards your team's front at any time. Reposition and stand ahead as long as possible. In team fights, stay towards your team's front to absorb the damage. But, peel for your team with your Q and focus the enemy that is the greatest threat to them (or focus the enemy backline if the enemy front line is weak) to keep them alive."}
{"text": "As kayle, A very weak early game pushes her to have no form of lane presence. She is an easy gank target at this point, and closing it to this point of the game is very easy. She is quite inclined to CC abilities, especially when her Ultimate R is down to buy her some time for the CC to wear out. Even in the fights, she will have to be careful, otherwise she will get CC=d string and deleted. As for her game style, she will be focused on catching the side waves and not accompanying her team most of the time. This gives the enemy team a huge advantage over her team in terms of numbers and livelihoods."}
{"text": "As skarner, His tankiness is really high during this phase of the game. This should allow him to soak up a lot of damage and be a very effective frontline for his team.\n\nAt level 16, Skarner will put the third and final point in his Ultimate. This will put his Ult on a rather short cooldown.\n\nAt this stage of the game, he would have secured many objectives to give his team a big advantage.\n"}
{"text": "Against twitch, Place a level 1 ward near his red buff. This will help you spot him before he is able to use his s  and gank either the mid lane or another nearby lane.\n\nAs Twitch will be looking to gank frequently in the early game, if he is spotted on one side of the map, you could invade the other side of his jungle to steal away camps and reduce his gold income.\n\nTwitch will ignore commonly placed bush wards with his s . Place vision around his jungle entrances or on top of camps to make spotting him easier."}
{"text": "As lulu, This champion is pretty immobile and is prone to CC. If they get caught out by any CC, they will probably die.\n\nLulu relies on her team to carry while she provides them with heals and shields.\n\nLulu is a squishy champion with low hit points. This makes her pretty vulnerable and easy to kill. Picking your fights and avoiding constant trading is key to winning."}
{"text": "As zeri, Her level 11 power peak is pretty strong. 2 points in her Ultimate R offers Zeri a lot of extra pressure to kill. During the middle of the game, Zeri would have picked up several items. She will do a lot of damage in the fights and be able to carry them solo if she is ahead of her at this stage of the game. At level 9, Zeri will maximize her Q-capacity. As she uses the most this ability, her --cars to do a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As aphelios, You are still enough that can make you a prime target for the CC chain and the assassins. You rely on prolonged jobs, so you get out quickly will give the enemy team a huge advantage (especially if you have your Infernum W up when you die). Some combinations of weapons are really bad on you and don't synergise well. This can lead to times when you can't respond as efficiently as your counterpart. Avoid fighting until you get a favorable combination of weapons. You are the dependent element during the middle of the game. If you are constantly camped early, you won't be able to close freely and will have a difficult time for the game to continue."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks Ultimate R is very good in team fighting, especially in closed areas as it will allow it to inflict damage to tons of champions at once. Moreover, in team fighting, his W will heal him a lot. Additional support/damage will be really beneficial in team fighting."}
{"text": "As skarner, It must avoid these guard places if it wants to move forward. Skarner is subject to CC, which makes the use of its E and Ultimate quite difficult. To make full use of these capabilities, you must look for situations where you cannot be interrupted. If the enemy team separates, or if the front line still blocks the enemy door, it will be difficult to use your Ultimate on a port champion. Using your Ult on a tank is really not worth it."}
{"text": "As drmundo, At level 9, Dr Mundo will max his E. His ability to 1v1 the enemy Jungler, or 1v1 any lane champion, will be very high. Don\u2019t be afraid to 1v1 champions if you\u2019re ahead.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Dr Mundo should\u2019ve completed a couple of core items. As every item he buys offers him defensive stats, he will be very tanky throughout the mid-game. He should be a giant menace in team fights.\n\nAt level 11, Dr Mundo will put the second point in his Ultimate R. The additional health regeneration combined with his overall tankiness will be very hard to deal with in the mid-game. He will be incredibly tanky during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "Against syndra, After it uses a ability, you could look to play aggressively. Syndra's E has an incredibly long cooldown. If it uses it to trade and miss, use this chronometer to play aggressively and look for a trade.

Constantly adapt your positioning so she is unable to land a dizziness with a ball and her E."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Late-game should be really easy to maneuver around as your E will be on a short cooldown. Your plan should be to utilize the fog of war to bamboozle the enemy backline.\n\nWith your Ultimate e on a massively short cooldown, you should be able to run enemies down quickly and take down the backline in a jiffy.

At level 6, Warwick can go for more aggressive games and close the enemy lantern. He can also use his Ultimate R to help his allies in other ways. Once Warwick has a few Q points, his keeping in the track will help him even in the toughest matches. He will also be able to exchange more effectively in the way"}

At level 9, his first ability will be maximized. This will give him a boost of massive damage, and he will kill people in an instant. It will be quite the peak of power for him. Kled will have several elements in the middle of the game, which will make him a devastating force to manage."}

If you can keep him pushed in, you may be able to get things done elsewhere on the map.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard for you to get ganks in this matchup. Don\u2019t expect your Jungler to gank unless you\u2019ve cleared the Shrooms t from the lane.\n\nTry and not pick a melee champion into him. You\u2019ll find more success with a ranged champion instead."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio has a very strong laning phase when he is paired with an aggressive ADC. This will allow him to win the way and snowball his portage. Its Ultimate R is an excellent team combat tool that can keep any of his allies alive longer. Using it at the right time could also allow him to get a knockup of 5 people. Galio can help his Jungler, ADC, or Mid-laner easily with his Ultimate R. Its Ultimate R has such a wide range that can allow him to move incredibly quickly around the map."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn doesn't have a duelling Ultimate R. This makes her low position level 6 when it comes to all in. She can't fight right 5v5. She will need to flank in team fights. If the enemy has the vision or knows where she is, she will be unable to fight team properly and will be forced to divide the thrust. You are a champion who is inclined to all-in and CC. Mix this with the fact that Quinn is squishy enough, it can be difficult to deal with enemy teams that have a lot of CC."}
{"text": "As orianna, Take care of its range and auto attacks as they inflict significant damage early. Do not approach the minions to prevent its Qs and Ws from quickly pushing the wave. Try to lure its ultimate before committing to an all-in-one if possible. Its level 6 is stronger, but you can try to exploit it by engaging while its ball is far from its position."}
{"text": "As trundle, Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs. As you are not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}

Look for frequent trades with the enemy throughout the laning phase. Getting an early killing could snowball the way strongly in your favor. Once you are level 6, look for more aggressive play. Your Ultimate R is an excellent scarring tool and you can get killed with it."}
{"text": "As sivir, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Push and constantly push the enemy with your abilities. Once they are low, you can look for an aggressive all-in. However, while the murders are pleasant, your goal is to poke and not commit to fight. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a golden lead."}
{"text": "As akali, At level 16, Akali will have 3 points in her Ultimate She will be able to bring a lot of damage to anyone she contacts. Your Ultimate will also be on a lower cooldown, which is very beneficial. At this stage of the game, Akali would be close to max build. Unloading an E on an enemy squissy champion should lead to an easy murder. This murder could result in either the Baron or a favorable forced fight 5v4. Akali falls into the later parts of the game that the teams begin to group. Akali is at its strongest in split fighting or peaks rather than the 5v5 right. Moreover, the enemy should start buying defensive items, which will make it harder for them to remove them."}
{"text": "Against vex, She can also use it again if the marked target dies. Try and divide slightly so that Vex can not handle a lot of AOE damage with her Q and E. Get rid of Vex, with poke before launching a fight could be very beneficial as she will miss on the shield to protect herself with. Her damage output will also be reduced."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Its poke damage is quite high and heinous for the enemy team to manage. This poke can accumulate over time and makes it so that the enemy lantern is forced to play in the cover of their minion wave. Its potential to clear the waves is very high due to its W and Q. This allows it to clear the waves quite quickly and get the priority of the track, which allows it to help his team to secure the objectives. Excels in the fighting taking place in bottlenecks and close quarters because it allows it to quickly stack its Passive. This combined with its Ultimate R can easily allow it to destroy the enemy team."}

{"text": "As morgana, Level 3 is a massive peak because it can now look for all the in while being completely safe itself. Its E makes its most secure ganks. Getting its Ultimate R is another huge peak of power. This means that it can descend a lot of enemies and increase the CC chain after landing its Q. The first element will allow Morgana to the track more efficient. It will allow it to do a lot of damage with its W and Q."}
{"text": "As quinn, Use your abilities to disrupt Quinn's mobility and limit her ability to reposition in fights.\n\nBuilding armor will help you to reduce the amount of damage Quinn can do to you with her physical damage, increasing your chances of surviving and engaging in fights.\n\nConsider using your ultimate to interrupt Quinn's ultimate. You can then bash her head in with your CC.\n\nWhen possible, try to engage on Quinn when her E is on cooldown. This will reduce her ability to escape and increase your chances of taking her down."}
{"text": "As yuumi, At level thirteen, her Q and E will be maximized. This means that she will heal her wears at an alarming pace, and she will be an asset to her team. Once she gets two points in her Ultimate R, her survival is still increasing and getting involved with her can be a little more difficult. Yuumi is really good during team fighting as her Ultimate R will leave her enemy team slow and whole while healing her allies, respectively. Healing is really powerful, and the added effects are just as welcome."}
{"text": "As vladimir, Does not have any form of gank agency so probably will not get a gank during the early match. It is rather weak early as well and is quite useless if the game does not continue for too long. Misuse of his l can have him killed immediately, especially if the enemy is running on their ability to control the main crowd. This can make him a very easy gank target. Wounds grise you are a jerk to his existence, especially if it is acquired early. This weakness can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage over him due to the reduced Q health."}
{"text": "Against katarina, If you can interrupt it as soon as it channels its Ultimate R, its damage release will be low and you will have a greater chance of winning the team fight. Avoid fighting in tight and closed areas. Katarina has crazy AOE damage and if your team is grouped closely, she will be able to melt you. Try to fight in areas that let your team slightly divided. Force a team fight when Katarinas Zhonyas is down is a good way to get her out of the team fight quickly. This will reduce her ability to take control of the team fight with her resets."}
{"text": "Against karthus, If you see Karthus using his Ultimate e at the beginning of the fight, try the CC to cancel his Ultimate e. If you kill Karthus at the beginning of the fight, try to reposition and move away from his Passive. This will reduce his damage exit and make the survival of the team fight easier. If you spot Karthus in a side track pushed by division, you can start a team fight. But, you must keep in mind that he can influence the existing fight with his Ultimate e."}
{"text": "As camille, Its potential of duel and decapitation of enemies should be capitalized by it. Neutral objective combats will have to be treated differently. Camille should always try to enter the enemy backline using the fog of war to her advantage during such combats. This is mainly because she does not have a constant AoE DPS capability in her kit. Its basic elements should allow her to take any significant unimpeded combat. She should focus on the glove of her losers frequently to help them accumulate an advance during this phase of the game."}

{"text": "As thresh, Thresh is really tanky during this phase of the game because he will have a lot of articles. This will allow him to both engage and peel for his wears at the same time. Thresh does not point too loud at level 16 because his Ultimate an effect remains always the same. This essentially means that he has started to fall and now depends on his Q to win the game. Thresh exists to peel for his wears and find targets with his Q at this stage of the game. If he finds himself missing the ability, he will not be able to do anything until he is back again (unless he has his Flash)."}
{"text": "As nasus, Try to pull the pressure while your team is able to get something done elsewhere on the map. Be ready to group with your team when you are unable to get more goals alone.

{"text": "As zac, Zac is decent enough in the team fights at the end of the game, especially if he manages to get a flank on the enemy. Another reason why he is so good is that he can easily bypass the vision and catch the out-of-guard enemy. Once he reaches level 16, he will have three points in his Ultimate R. This means that he will be able to use it frequently and inflict a lot of damage on the enemy team during a one-way trip. He should be able to catch the out-of-guard enemies easily. Once he reaches the stage where he has two different capabilities maximumd out, he will have a simple time to fix peaks while working with his Jungler. He can even help his Jungler to put in place death brushes for the enemy."}

Make sure you get as many neutral goals as possible while relying on choices to win the game. The goal is to get rid of the enemy Jungler before doing anything."}
{"text": "As akali, At this stage, your map awareness should be at its peak. You should always try to shove the wave with your Q and try to roam towards any lane which has an extended laner. This will allow you to use your E and Ultimate to catch up to such extended targets, and get rid of them quickly.\n\nWhen you are fighting for a neutral objective and you manage to land an E on an enemy champion, you don't need to always go-in. This is because your presence, and the threat of your E, W, and R which automatically keeps the enemy carries away from you. This will ultimately result in the enemy team being zoned out.\n\nProper usage of your W is very important during this stage of the game. If used freely, the enemy laner can bait you into such an all-in and then get rid of Akali quickly. Also, attempt to stay in a longer lane as it gives you more opportunities to all-in someone."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Move to the mid-lane once you\u2019ve destroyed the first tower in your lane to open up the map.\n\nIn team fights, kite backwards when necessary. Even though Caitlyn is strong, she cannot tank a lot of damage. Kite backwards to increase your chances of surviving. Reserve your E purely as an escape tool if the enemy has strong all-in.\n\nEven though your Support will often run away to ward, make sure you stick with them as much as possible. If you\u2019re alone, the enemy may try to set up an ambush and take you down. Avoid walking through unwarded parts of the map during the mid-game."}
{"text": "As lulu, Level 11 is when Lulu becomes a real catalyst. That's because his Ultimate R will now have two points and won't let her die easily. Lulu's efficiency in team fighting really comes into play during this phase of the game. His W and Ultimate R will help him face enemies who like to flance and end up behind his back."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 16 isn't that great a spike as it will only increase the damage of the ability and reduce the cooldown. It won't provide any utility whatsoever.\n\nMost of his abilities will be maxed out during this phase of the game. He can look for picks all around the map and can set up death brushes in the Jungle.\n\nPantheon is pretty tanky in the late game and can dish out tons of damage as well. His E and W allow him to quickly pick off targets without taking damage in return."}
{"text": "As kayn, Peel for your allies at the end of the game, especially if you are Red Kayn. Keep them alive and focus the champion they are focused will increase your chances of winning the fight. Group with your team at the end of the game. You can play on the side slightly if you are early and are able to assassinate someone. Continue focusing goals like the Baron or Dragon. Getting a choice could provide you with enough time to do the Baron."}
{"text": "Against swain, At level 6, the exit and survival of the damage increases. You should not engage in a fight with him unless you can bring him down quickly that his Ultimate R will offer him additional protection and health regeneration. Swain, early play is abuseable because it is really weak early. Once the mid-game hits, you will have to play more respectable. It is really good in the team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Bursting him at the beginning of the fight will make it difficult for him to inflict damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin may try to kick k somebody like the ADC into his teammates. Group close together to make it harder for him to kick a carry into the arms of his team.\n\nAs Lee Sin needs to get onto someone in order to kick them towards his team, locking him down with CC as soon as he engages is ideal as he is rather squishy and will be unable to escape if he\u2019s CC chained. \n\nLee Sin is really good at taking down or picking off isolated targets. Make sure you group closer to your team to make it harder for him to take anyone down whose alone."}
{"text": "As sett, Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. So your goal during the laning phase is to look for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen can start crashing as soon as he reaches level 3. Pre-level 6, make sure you place the vision around his jungle entrances to reduce his ability to get ganks off. Whenever Shen uses his Ultimate R on an ally, if he doesn't use it near you, you should use that time to gank another way, invade his jungle or take a major goal. If you want to invade Shen in early play, wait for him to use one of his abilities or wait for him to be low in energy before fighting him to make it harder for him to escape or to come back with you."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo becomes really powerful once he hits level 16. This means that his Ultimate R will deal massive amounts of damage in a brief time. Moreso, the short cooldown will allow Yasuo to deal with tanks regularly.\n\nYasuo will have a bunch of completed items during this phase of the game. This means that Yasuo will decimate the enemy due to his Passive and r damage. He can pretty much one-shot squishies with ease.\n\nDue to all his completed items, and his ability to quickly dash around and pierce through the tanks' armors, Yasuo will be able to deal a plethora of damage in a short time. The enemy team might as well FF at this point if Yasuo manages to get ahead."}
{"text": "As anivia, Whenever Anivia\u2019s Passive is down, she is incredibly vulnerable to an all-in. Play safer whenever it is on cooldown.\n\nHer t is easy to dodge. If she misses it, she is incredibly vulnerable to an all-in. You should only throw it out unless you are certain you can land it.\n\nAnivia relies on mana and will need to get a Tear on her first back. This can delay her Mythic which makes her slightly weaker as the enemy will get their Mythic item before her."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting without it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As teemo, Level six is the \"peak of power\" for Teemo. It will allow him to be extraordinarily heinous and sneaky now, especially as the game progresses. The first element will increase his overall damage in the game. This will help him in the duels and allow him to use his spells frequently as well. Several elements in the first ability will increase the damage and reduce the cooling of the said ability. It can allow Teemo to do a lot of brilliant damage."}
{"text": "As kled, Once he gets two points in his Ultimate R, Kled can focus on running enemies down and completely destroying them with his team. He can even score singular picks with it.\n\nAt level 9, his first ability will be maxed out. This will give him a massive damage boost, and he will kill people in an instant. It will be quite the power spike for him.\n\nKled will have multiple items in the mid-game, which will make him a devastating force to deal with. This is really helpful for his team, and Kled will quickly act as the frontline for his team.        "}
{"text": "As camille, Continue to look for picks whenever possible. Stay with your team though, as you don\u2019t want to go in without them.\n\nDue to your low cooldown on your Ultimate in the late game, make sure you actively look for plays and isolate the enemy carries.\n\nStay with your team at all times, and peel and protect for your allies."}
{"text": "As camille, Once Camille hits level 3, she can effectively start looking for ganks. This is because she will unlock all 3 of her basic abilities.\n\nWhen Camille hits level 6, her Ultimate R should result in easy kills for her and her laners. A good Camille will be looking to gank as soon as her Ultimate R comes up.\n\nAfter Camille has completed her Mythic item, her kill pressure and 1v1 potential increases heavily. If you weren\u2019t a threat before then, you definitely will be now as your Mythic gives you so much trading power."}
{"text": "As twitch, If Twitch invades you early, think twice before fighting him. You should only fight him if you can close the gap between you and him, or else he will just kite you.\n\nJust focus on farming early. You need as much gold and XP as possible to get into the game.\n\nPlace vision and buy control wards to help your team spot Twitch before he is able to gank and get kills.\n\nIf you see him ganking, invade his jungle and steal away his camps."}
{"text": "Against nidalee, Nidalee is an early-playing dominant Jungler. Ward's jungle entrances to spot her leaving her jungle to make the glove harder for her. Deeper rooms are preferred against Nidalee as she can use her k to jump on the walls and maneuver around the commonly watched bushes. Keep this in mind when setting up the rooms. Nidalee is easy to kill if the enemy Jungler has not been the kite camps properly. Try and invade and kill early as she doesn't always have a healthy light."}
{"text": "Against ahri, As long as you build a magical resistance and avoid her charm, she has no way to shoot you. Ahri likes to wander after level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate. Ping her as soon as she leaves the track and tries to follow it if possible. If you can't follow her, push the wave and try to bring her back to the track. Ahri is incredibly vulnerable when her Ultimate is down. Try to lure her first, then call the help of your Jungler to kill her when it's unavailable. Make sure the wave is closer to your side of the map so it's easier for them to spoil you."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, You can use the digital advantage to force goals or look for favorable fights to win an advantage. If Tryndamere is divided by pushing into the bottom of the game, avoid sending a lot of people to stop him when Baron. It will take you some time to kill him even if you hire 5 champions to kill him who could give his team a lot of time to take the Baron. Try to fight when Tryndamere doesn't have his Ultimate e}up. It will make it incredibly hard for him to straighten out a lot of damage in a team fight."}
{"text": "Against trundle, Trundle is a duelist and will look to trade early. At levels 2 and 3, he may look for an all in if you\u2019re low enough. Play cautiously when low and do not overextend if he has his Pillar e.\n\nIf you are a tank, Trundles level 6 all-in can be deadly as it reduces your defensive stats to a crisp. When trading, be careful around the level 6 mark as he may look for an all-in.\n\nDepending on what build path the Trundle has gone for, he will peak at different times. Keep this in mind and always look to see what item\u2019s he has purchased and play accordingly."}
{"text": "As gnar, If possible, use your range advantage to harass enemy champions from afar when they walk until the last blow. This will allow you to gain a health advance on the enemy. Keep an eye on your resource bar at all times. Look for aggressive games when you are about to change shape or when your Ultimate R is about to come. When you are level 6, you actually have a surprising amount of damage. You can use this to your advantage to get a kill or set up your Jungler."}
{"text": "As karma, Unlike most champions, Karma unlocks her Ultimate has at level 1. This means that at level 6, she doesn't have as much pressure compared to many other champions especially if they re-level 6 power peak is very strong. When Karmas d is down, she is vulnerable to attack and will need to play safely while he is on the cooldown. His Q can easily be avoided if the enemy builds a huge wave or positions properly."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong will be unable to fight as a team if you can trap him before he has the chance to engage. Delay a team fight while you trap him as much as possible. Do not fight inside the jungle or around goals. You will usually be gathered together which will allow Wukong to get a great Ultimate noff."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Watch your positioning in team fights as Morgana will try to catch someone out with her Q. Make sure you stand in an appropriate position so you\u2019re able to dodge it. Don\u2019t stand too far forward nor too far back.\n\nOnce Morgana has gone fishing with her Q, she is relatively defenceless which you can capitalise on. As soon as she uses her Q, charge at her and try to take her down.\n\nWhenever Morgana casts her Ultimate R in a team fight, try to get out of the area as quickly as you can so you do not get chained down and CC\u2019d."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Once Aatrox hits level 9, his Q will be maxed. The reduced cooldown and additional haste will mean this ability is on a very short cooldown.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Aatrox will have brought items that will reduce his abilities cooldown. Through levels 9-13 his abilities will be on a very short cooldown.\n\nWhen Aatrox hits level 11 and puts two points in his Ultimate R, he will be a severe threat to the enemy in team fights. Fight around your Ultimate to deal a ton of damage and survive the team fight."}
{"text": "As diana, Diana can start ganking from level 3 onwards, but the more levels behind her the better. She should avoid over forcing ganks if they\u2019re too risky so you don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nLevel 6 offers Diana lots of burst damage and CC. Because your Ultimate R is such a strong tool, make sure you\u2019re trying to gank whenever it\u2019s available.\n\nWhen Diana has completed her Mythic item, her 1v1 potential is incredibly strong. Don\u2019t be afraid to fight the enemy Jungler alone if you have the item and level advantage."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Locking Taliyah in the way will allow you to kill her more easily. Try to concentrate her first because she is super squishy and easy to kill when she is CC. When trading with Taliyah, stand behind the minions so they block her Q damage. But, be on the lookout for her C. At level 6, her pressure to kill increases, but she can't use her Ultimate R mid-fight. You should have the level 6 advantage if you have a Ultimate fight."}
{"text": "As jax, Just disengage/ reposition if he jumps on you with his E so it doesn't CC you! Similarly, avoid committing if he has his E available.\n\nAs Jax is so weak early, just go into their jungle and try to fight them or force them to recall. Setting them behind will delay their power spike.\n\nTry to take Dragons as often as possible. It\u2019s key to getting yourself and your allies ahead.\n\nAs you\u2019re much stronger than Jax early on, make sure to gain an early lead by ganking your allies before Jax even gets a chance to come online.\n"}
{"text": "Against seraphine, Avoid team fighting around major objectives if Seraphine is nearby. Grouping closely together is going to benefit her and allow her to get a good Ultimate R off and CC your whole team.\n\nSimilarly, avoid fighting in the jungle as your team will be grouped together which can allow her to get another good Ultimate R off. Try to fight in the open and split slightly apart so she cannot CC your whole team.\n\nSeraphine will often go to ward alone during the mid-game. You can use this to your advantage to fight and pick her off. While she\u2019s dead, you can look to take the Baron, a Dragon or look for a team fight with the numbers advantage."}
{"text": "As milio, Milio is the king of disengagement and anti-engagement. His Ultimate can protect his entire team from engagement and CC tools. Milio also has a lot of utility tools. He has a healing, CC and shields! His Q has a good poke and CC that will come in practice when attacking the enemy. This mixture with his automatic attacks can offer him a lot of damage in the way."}
{"text": "As aatrox, You will want to CC him as much as possible. You may even be able to interrupt his dash using your *Q*.\n\nSome healing reduction will help you a lot in this matchup. Make it a point to not let him sustain off you.\n\nAlways look to ult him before he can get to your allies. This way you will be able to kill him quickly with your team.\n\nThe wave can be kept close to your tower if need be. Just make sure that you build up a sizeable wave before looking for an all-in."}
{"text": "Against viktor, Viktors first power spike is once he has hit level 6. His Ultimate m will give him extra kill pressure in lane and he will start to play slightly more aggressive.\n\nHis abilities will be stronger with every upgrade.\n\nOnce Viktor has completed his first item, and upgraded his y, he will be able to clear the minion waves very fast and keep you pushed under your tower."}
{"text": "As corki, Even if his ultimate e does not cost much mana, he can run low on mana quickly if he is constantly using his b and Ultimate e together. When he is out of mana, he is not a threat and nor can he use his b to escape. Corki is a squishy champion. This makes it difficult for him to survive the phases of laning against champions with a lot of brilliant damage and poke. Compared to other ADC, Corkis mobility tool b has a very long time cooling early."}
{"text": "Against velkoz, The Force team fights as quickly as possible: preferably when its Ultimate R is on cooldown. Do not delay a team fight as it will allow it to drop your team with its Qs and Ws. Avoid team fights or force goals like the Baron or Dragon when Vel-Skoz is alive and nearby. It has a great poke thanks to its Q, W and R that will make it difficult for your team to secure the goal easily. Avoid fighting in bottlenecks like in the jungle as it will give Vel-Skoz a easier time to land its E, doing damage with its W and founding your team with its Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As sett, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "As talon, They are going to be ganking early, and Pantheon can gank early too. Make sure you apply as much pressure to them as you can.\n\nBefore invading, make sure you have your Passive stacked so you can win the trade.\n\nIf they invade you, be prepared to fight, but only do so if your Passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just back off.\n\nPost 6, they win the 1v1 as they\u2019re stronger when their Ultimate is up.\n"}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, Ensure you\u2019re always behind a minion so it is harder for him to land his Q. If he is able to land his Q, he may look for a fight.\n\nAs soon as Tahm Kench activates his Grey Health E, disengage from the fight as it will offer him protection and you may be unable to kill him through the bonus health.\n\nTahm Kench is quite immobile. If you can, try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will force him to overextend for farm, which can allow you to chase him down, or set up your Jungler to kill him."}
{"text": "As udyr, Look to take down the enemy carries. Focus the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them with your other frontline champions.\n\nAs you\u2019re the Jungler, you need to make sure you\u2019re always alive in the late game. If you die before a major objective spawns, the enemy will be able to take it.\n\nMake sure you are always on the side of the map that the next major objective is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show yourself, the enemy will take the objective for free."}
{"text": "As belveth, Late game you become an unstoppable attack speed carry with an insane amount of mobility, consistent damage output and also good survivability too. Try to time your fights around your teammates initiation, and always be the follow up rather than the initiation. You\u2019re going to struggle to be taken down as long as you aren\u2019t caught out alone, and use your Q\u2019s mobility to dodge as many major CC abilities as possible in teamfights. When amongst multiple targets, don\u2019t forget to use your E to keep yourself alive aswell as priorizing those Void Corals from fallen enemies.\n\nThe focus remains the same about fighting around objectives. If you take down a Baron at this point it can easily decide the game with that extended empowered True Form you get from consuming its Void Coral. Focus on this as much as you can without forcing it with a 50/50."}
{"text": "As elise, As well as levels 6 and 11, Elise doesn't point too much to 16 when she puts a third point in her Ultimate. In the last game, Elise's E will be on a short cooldown. This allows her to look for more choices and potentially win her team the game. The more Elise gets, the stronger she will be. However, in the last game, it will be harder for her to kill the enemy because they will be tankier."}
{"text": "As swain, Very immobile and is weak during the early laning phase. This is especially true if he is facing a champion who can all-in and CC him.\n\nIs quite vulnerable when his E is down as it is his main form of CC. \n\nGrievous wounds can completely counter his kit during the early game and also affect his mid-game. He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he won\u2019t have the amplified healing and AoE damage."}
{"text": "As akali, Once you have access to all your basic capabilities, you can start trading more efficiently with the enemy. At level 3, you can look for more aggressive coins, but don't engage on them, so you don't fall back. At level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as his Ultimate offers him a lot of pressure to kill extra. Look for killers with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, When playing as a varied champion, try to stay as far as possible using your range advantage to harass him. Staying at maximum distance will make it difficult for him to jump on you with his W. After he touches level 6, be careful when returning to the track if he is not already shown. He can use his Ultimate R to get behind you and all of it as soon as you return to the track."}
{"text": "As anivia, During the mid-game, Anivia should have her Tear fully stacked. This will be very helpful for her as it will prevent her from running out of mana when using her Ultimate m.\n\nAnivia is good in team fights, and the mid-game is usually when teams start grouping. This makes her a good mid-game champion.\n\nThanks to Anivia\u2019s sustain and her Ultimate m, she has good control over objectives like the Baron or Dragon. Don\u2019t be afraid to team up with your Jungler and the ADC to quietly take these objectives while your team does something elsewhere on the map."}
{"text": "Against amumu, Amumu\u2019s level 6 power spike is incredibly strong as it allows him to start ganking thanks to his Ultimate y. You can delay his power spike by invading him early.\n\nOnce Amumu gets tons of cooldown reduction, his Ultimate y will be on a shorter cooldown. This allows him to gank more often and have more success when it comes to ganking.\n\nDepending on the build, you\u2019ll need to either invest in armour pen if you\u2019re an AD champion, or magic pen if you\u2019re an AP champion. If he is going damage, you might need some defensive items. As the game goes along, he will become stronger and stronger, and tankier and tankier."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes a lot of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You have to play her a lot to make use of her kit. Although she can do a lot of damage and be a useful champion in team fights, she won't have as much gold or revenue to buy items as she would in the role of Top. When she plays like Camille, she can be harshly counterfeited by some champions."}
{"text": "As chogath, The longer the game goes, the more stacks Cho\u2019Gath will have. This makes him quite strong in the late game.\n\nWhen he hits level 16, Cho\u2019Gath will put the third and final point in his Ultimate t. He will be able to easily bite down on and execute enemies who are caught out of position by his team.\n\nDepending on his build path, Cho\u2019Gath will either deal a lot of damage in late game fights or be incredibly tanky."}
{"text": "Against urgot, In the team fights, try to block the engagement and Urgot R for your weak teammates. In this case, he will waste his cooldown on you: save your teammate. If Urgot hits his Fear Beyond Death R try to kill him before he executes your teammate. If you do it successfully your teammate will live on. Buy a Quicksilver Sash if you want to deny the execution of Fear Beyond Death R. The forest itself cannot be removed, but you can QSS the second game just before the run."}
{"text": "Against akshan, Akshan\u2019s first power spike is when he unlocks all 3 basic abilities. Although, his early game damage is pretty good at level 1 and 2.\n\nWhen he unlocks his Ultimate at level 6, his kill pressure intensifies. Keep this in mind and avoid staying in lane when low.\n\nAfter Akshan\u2019s first back, he should\u2019ve picked up a component item for his Mythic. Unless you\u2019ve matched him, be careful as he will win trades and all-ins."}

{"text": "As blitzcrank, Look for picks with your b but avoid pulling in a tank during the late game as it may enable them to start a fight. Try to pick off and pull b in a squishy enemy champion instead.\n\nAs you\u2019re a Support, avoid warding alone in the late game. If you get picked off, the enemy will be able to take nearby objectives or use their numbers advantage to win a team fight.\n\nConsistently place vision around the map to help your team secure objectives and get picks. Having vision around the Baron and Dragon is needed to help your team to victory."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Avoid team fighting at the end of the game unless your Ultimate R and Zhonyas Hourglass are in place. If you try to fight as a team when one of them is down, you will be rather vulnerable. Use your capabilities at the end of the game to peel your aircraft carriers to keep them alive. Use your Ultimate R on the nearest enemy champion and focus them first. Stay with your team at all times. Don't leave them and go to split thrust as the enemy can force a fight while you're gone. Stay grouped, but be ready to stay on the side and out of sight."}
{"text": "As rumble, Always look to pin him to a wall and beat him up when you get the chance. This is important towards ensuring that he can't channel his abilities.\n\nAvoid fighting him when his Resource bar is half filled. It will otherwise make you take a lot of damage and you will get chunked out quite a bIt.\n\nKeeping your carries safe is of paramount importance so make sure that you take him out of a fight as soon as possible.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Gangplanks early game is rather weak. Focus on farming and earning as much gold as possible to get your key items quickly.\n\nWatch the map at all times post level 6. Your Ultimate R is very impactful and can help your allies to win fights and skirmishes.\n\nAvoid fighting in the early game if possible. Gangplank needs time to come online and in some matchups you\u2019ll need to just focus on farming and surviving."}
{"text": "As ahri, When the Ultimate is not at the top, just focus on pushing your wave but don't stretch out while doing that. Try to switch on a side track as soon as you can. It will allow you to hunt enemies more easily with your Ultimate and E. Securing the peaks during this step will make it easier for your team to get neutral goals. During the fights, always try to reach the enemy rear line by flanking them from out of sight. A sweater can help you with that. If you can't do it, you just have to pull on the enemy front line, until you can catch someone with your E."}
{"text": "As malphite, Malphite will now have several articles with which it will be able to flatten a lot of damage. Its cooldowns will be reduced, which will allow it to completely take control of the Jungle with its Ultimate h. Adding another point to its Ultimate h will increase its output from the damage of the burst. It can easily use the ability to finish weak enemies who overdo their welcome in the way. Malphite is quite good in team fights, especially those that occur in the bottlenecks."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, Malzahar is not very strong in early play. You can abuse this by getting him down and forcing him to remember early. Once Malzhar reaches level 6, his death pressure increases thanks to his Ultimate R. Make sure you keep the river under surveillance so that you can spot his Jungler before they inflate your way like Malzhar is really not able to kill anyone alone. Once Malzahar gets an article, his ability to push the wave will become heinous. Try your hardest to push the wave as much as possible so that he can't wander for free, or take your turn early."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, A good Xin Zhao will use their Ultimate whenever he's up to gank an ally. Make sure to gank as much as possible, so you can apply as much pressure as they do. Xin Zhao is a weak early game champion. This makes them vulnerable to invasions by you and your team. Try to invade Xin Zhao as much as possible. As you're great at duelling and very early, try to make early games around the map for you and your allies in advance. As Xin Zhao has a strong potential to invade, it's crucial to keep your jungle entrances so you can spot them before they invade your jungle and kill you."}

Avoid walking in areas where you know Sion has been so its harder for you to get caught out by him.\n\nKite and disengage is Sion\u2019s biggest threat in a team fight. Try to keep him away from your team so he is unable to get a good Q knockup.\n\nAvoid grouping and fighting in the jungle as it will allow Sion to either get a really good knockup with his Q or get a really good Ultimate R off. Group together, but do not stand on top of one another so he is unable to get a multi-person knockup. "}
{"text": "Against anivia, Every time Anivia has her Passive, her ability to survive is much higher. Try to look for frequent jobs while her Egg is in decline, and call for help when needed. Once Anvia has a few levels behind her, her strength increases considerably. Respect her bursting and all-in-potential in every time her t is available. Post 6, Anivia can quickly push the minion wave with her m. Once she has access to her Ultimate m, she will constantly push you into your turn. Keep this in mind and try to prevent her from doing so."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Watch your position in the late game team fights. Stay as safe as possible so you won't be killed first. Cassiopeia is one of the strongest late game champions, so staying alive is the key. Stay with your team in the late game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to choose you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team."}
{"text": "As kindred, Kindred is a really good early game ganker once she gets her r. That, combined with her Q provides her with enough mobility to easily gank her targets.\n\nEarly stacks are vital for a Kindred to succeed in the game. She will require some help from her team to get the marks, else she may end up dying and be set back massively.\n\nThe first item component will significantly enhance her dueling power. It will help her overall, especially when trying to contest for marks.        "}
{"text": "Against morgana, If you can bait him, you should try to use the cooldown to play more aggressive and try to kill her. Make sure you're still standing behind at least 1 minion so she's unable to land her Q and CC you. Once she has her first element, Morgana will just push the wave with her W. Make sure to push her back so she doesn't take your turn early."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, Kog\u2019Maw is weak in the early game. You can abuse this to get an early lead or blow his Summoner Spells.\n\nAt level 6, Kog\u2019Maw will have an easier time poking and trading thanks to his Ultimate y. Take care when trading with him, and try not to let him burst you down.\n\nKog\u2019Maw benefits from extended trades once he has a few points in his e. Do not go for extended trades with him unless you have an advantage."}
{"text": "As renata, You will definitely want to sit in the lane brush and try to Q enemies. If you are in a matchup where you want your ADC to scale, focus on using your Q defensively.\n\nBeing a part of team fights and neutral objective fights is a must. Your W has a very good chance of reviving someone but always prioritize an ally who can destroy the enemy quickly within the decay period.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, look for as many clumped fights in the Jungle as you can. Sit in a Jungle brush and wait for a bunch of enemies to walk towards you."}
{"text": "As singed, Be careful about Singed's all-in capability, and his intent to displace you into his team. It can easily get you CC'd and killed.\n\nTry not to chase him frequently in this matchup. Although your mobility is high, you will still take a lot of DPS from him.\n\nOnce you get your ult, make sure that you CC Singed every chance you get. Work with your team to take him down thereafter.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As soraka, His self-appointed Q W also provides a lot of healing. His E is very advantageous in group fighting. He can send the enemy team into disarray and force to play defensively. His Ultimate R allows him to impact any fight on the map with ease. This allows him to change the results of the skirmishes and duels throughout the game."}
{"text": "As malphite, It is weak early because its presence is negligible, and it cannot do much against the various champions. All it has to do is to maintain its health until it reaches level six. Once it reaches level six, its presence will skyrocket, becoming a major threat to the enemy lantern. Working with the Jungler allies will help it massively. The first element will allow it to spam its abilities quite frequently. It will also allow it to inflict more damage, especially once it has its Ultimate."}
{"text": "As trundle, Before invading, make sure that you have your passive stacked so that you can win the trade. If they invade you, be ready to fight, but only do so if your passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just step back. Post 6, they win the 1v1 as they are stronger when their Ultimate is in place."}
{"text": "Against lucian, In team fights, take care that Lucian can use his E to reposition and escape danger. Try and wait for him to use his E before using your CC capabilities so it's harder for him to avoid them. Avoid letting Lucian get a full channel of his Ultimate R on you in a team fight by decommiting or canceling it with CC. Lookout for Lucian positioning. He will often walk forward to land auto attacks. Once he's mispositioned, use this to your advantage to concentrate him down."}
{"text": "As soraka, Level 16 is an excellent spike for Soraka as her heal will be highly potent and will be up quite frequently. Since it removes Grievous Wounds, team fighting has become easy for her team.\n\nBoth her W and Q will be maxed out during this game phase. She should be dealing with a lot of consistent damage, and her healing will be above par. Killing her carries will be phenomenally easy.\n\nHer W will be completely maxed out and let her heal her allies for significant amounts. Her Ultimate R will be the final nail on the coffin for the enemy team as it will remove Grievous Wounds and impart a massive heal to her team."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, Its level six is a massive powerpike because it allows it to play games on the whole map. Combined with its Gold CC card, it should be able to get it and the tracks in advance quickly. Its first element will allow it to spam its abilities and allow it to flatten a lot of damage quickly. It will allow it to track quite easily. Twisted Fate is fragile before-six. It can be spoiled frequently and quickly closed if it is overstretched in the track."}
{"text": "As tristana, Her early game aggression is relatively high when paired with a heavy CC or aggressive Support. It will allow her to take over the game early on with ease.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike. It allows her to use the ability as a finishing move if she can get the enemy low enough with her E. It can also be used defensively in some instances.\n\nThe first item component will help Tristana win fights easily. Her damage will be amplified by quite a decent amount."}
{"text": "As morgana, When ganking, if Morgana misses her Q, she is basically useless and the gank will fail. This makes it important for you to land your Q.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use your E correctly when fighting or in team fights, you\u2019re going to get killed (or your allies will get killed). \n\nAiming your Q around the minion wave can be hard. The way you counter this is by getting as close to the enemy as possible, and throw it out when they\u2019re away from the minion wave."}
{"text": "As fizz, When there are no team fights, push and draw enemy attention to you while your team sits or plays on the other side of the map. Fizz is really good at getting choices with its Ultimate R. Look to catch enemies who are alone or are too far ahead. Look to fight anyone trying to prevent you from pushing split or cultivating in a side track. You are a strong 1v1 champion and as long as they are not a tank, you should be able to fight them."}
{"text": "As twitch, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nThey can secure objective so much easier than you can. Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nA good player will be playing around their Ultimate as often as it comes up. You need to counter their ganking pressure by doing the same.\n\nHe will be ganking a lot early on. Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As leesin, Your goals are to secure the peaks and peel for your squishy targets during this phase of the game. Your Ultimate k will come in very practical and will allow you to make a lot of games. If the enemy team is loaded with heavy CC, make sure that you get a defensive element to help you. You should always remember that you hold the Smit for your team. Securing goals is very important, especially during this phase of the game, as these goals can be the game decision maker. Your e should allow you to make some really fancy games. You should try to get the enemy Jungler out of the pit using your Ultimate k."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Try to counter the gank and get murders in different parts of the map. Your damage C and the overall burst will help you a lot, especially if the enemy is pushed up. Fighting near choking points should help you a lot during this phase of the game. You might be able to get a C-knockup multi-man and breath squishies up easily."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Another point in its Ultimate R will reduce capacity cooling and increase damage. It allows it to be a massive threat during the engaged fighting. Its selection potential is massive during this phase of the game due to its ability to CC enemies with its E or Ultimate R. It helps a lot during Jungle fighting as well. Team fighting will be really good for Seraphine. It can heal and protect its allies for many with its W while relaxing a lot of damage with its abilities."}
{"text": "As bard, Once again, when Bard puts another point in his Ultimate R at level 16, he will not necessarily spike as his Ultimate R doesn\u2019t deal any damage. But, it will be on a shorter cooldown which can enable him to get picks. \n\nIn the very late game, his abilities will be on much shorter cooldowns. This is very useful for Bard as he will be able to use his Q multiple times in a team fight. This alone may either win his team the fight or help him peel for his carries.\n\nThe effects of Bard\u2019s Chimes or Meeps gets better and better as the game develops. In the late game, his empowered auto-attacks will deal a considerable amount of damage and have a huge slow if you auto-attack an enemy champion."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cass is a late-game monster. As long as she hasn\u2019t fallen behind, she will be incredibly strong in the late game.\n\nAt level 13, Cass will max out her Q. Pairing this with her E max, she will be able to deal a lot of damage in a skirmish.\n\nAt level 16, Cassiopeia will put the third point in her Ultimate R. It will deal a lot of damage, stun the enemy for a long period of time, be on a short cooldown and have the potential to win her team the game."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage (like an engage Support).\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille can look for an all-in at level 3 or 4 once she has access to her basic abilities. Try and do not lose too much health before hitting level 3 otherwise it is guaranteed that she will look for the all-in. Whenever Camille has her E available, you must be careful with your positioning because it will provide her an opportunity to engage if you are standing near a wall. Stand in the middle of the track as much as possible. At level 6 Camille will have access to her Ultimate R which can be deadly if you are low and overheard. Respect her all-in and do not push without vision as her Ultimate R can also be used to install her Jungler."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is good in team fights thanks to its AOE Ultimate R. Fortifying a fight or combat when Swain is nearby will make it easier for your team to win team fights. Avoid regrouping too closely around the goals or in team fights as it can allow Swain to land a very good multi-person E and start the team fight. Burst and poke is the best way to win a fight against Swain. Try to catch him before a team fight starts."}
{"text": "As reksai, She is very easy to kite as she has low range and is a melee champion. She will struggle killing mobile ADC\u2019s in team fights.\n\nIf she goes full damage, she will be very squishy and die easily in team fights. This can make this build path rather risky to go.\n\nHard to master. Rek\u2019Sai isn\u2019t as easy as a lot of players think. You\u2019ll need to put in a lot of practice if you want to master this champion!"}
{"text": "As sivir, The last point in its Ultimate R will secure more choices in the later parts of the game. The goal is to ensure a choice on the enemy Support or Jungler and get a neutral goal after that. Its overall damage will be really high during this phase of the game. It will be pretty safe due to its E and Ultimate R. Its Q and W will be maximized now. It will be able to deposit a lot of damage in the piled battles and will be able to push the waves quickly."}
{"text": "As fiora, At level 11, Fioras Ultimate R will be much better. Putting a second point in its Ultimate R is vital and its 1v1 killing pressure increases. Fiora is good in the middle of the game and will be looking for split thrust. She should be able to attract a lot of attention for her team so they can do things elsewhere like the Dragon or Baron. At level 9, Fiora will maximize her Q. This is a very important peak of power for her because it will allow her to look for more aggressive pieces, help her farm and also help her escape from sticky situations thanks to the cooldown bass."}
{"text": "As ekko, It is important that you try to take these goals whenever possible to give your team an advance. Once Ekko enters, it doesn't have a lot of left. So, you can abuse that that you are a good against ganker. Playing around your Ultimate is crucial in this matchup. Try to make plays whenever you have your Ultimate at your disposal."}
{"text": "As drmundo, Stay with your team at all times in the late game. Do not split push or run away from your team as the enemy will use the numbers advantage to start a team fight.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re always stood towards the front of your team at all times. Reposition and stand at the front for as long as possible.\n\nIn team fights, stay towards the front of your team to soak up damage. But, peel for your team with your Q and focus the enemy who is the biggest threat to them (or focus the enemy backline if the enemy frontline is weak) to keep them alive."}
{"text": "As varus, Try and stick with your Support throughout the mid-game. You\u2019re quite vulnerable and easy to kill if you\u2019re on your own. By staying with your Support, your survivability will increase.\n\nContinue picking up farm in the side lanes when no team fights are occurring, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to dish out damage in fights.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Try and space Veigar accordingly in the team fights. Do not position too far forward that it will allow Veigar to catch you with his n and start a team fight. Locking Veigar down with CC will be the best way to deal with him in the team fights. He is pretty squishy so if you are able to mount him and shoot him at the beginning of the fight, your team will have a easier time to win. Veigar will use his Ultimate R to try to bring down a weak / defenseless enemy. Buying items that will make you less likely to a-shot with his Ultimate R. Standing as far away as possible will also reduce his chances of using it on you."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Clear his turrets as quickly as possible. It will stop him from pushing as fast, and it will reduce his gold income.\n\nWhile clearing his turrets is key, let him push the minion wave, then clear the turrets.\n\nYour level 6 is stronger than his, but you cannot kill him unless you clear his turrets first!\n\nFocus on farming early and harassing with your Q and W. Avoid committing to fights unless his turrets are down!\n"}
{"text": "As yorick, Yorick's first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give him a significant damage boost and will raise his overall threat level for the enemy team.\n\nAt level 11, his Ultimate R will cause mayhem as it will become more powerful and will be able to split push on behalf of Yorick with some respectable effectiveness. If used properly, it will put the enemy team in a lose-lose situation.\n\nYorick's real power relies on split pushing, and he can do that really well during the mid-game with his Ultimate R. If the enemy leaves Yorick unaccounted for, he will be at their inhibitors in a matter of minutes."}
{"text": "As jax, Focus on early agriculture. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP. However, if you find an opportunity to sow or counter-gang nearby, don't be afraid to take it. If they invade you early, just back; you don't win early skirmishes with them. Try to secure these major goals when you can, as you have decent objective control."}
{"text": "As katarina, Look to assassinate targets that are moving around Summoners Rift alone. Katarina is really good at picking people off and taking down squishy targets.\n\nOnce your ADC and Support has rotated to the mid lane, look to split push and pick up gold and XP in a side lane.\n\nLook to group with your team once you hit your item spikes. Katarina is a great team fighter thanks to her AOE Ultimate R which will allow you to dish out lots of damage in a fight."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, Malzahar isn\u2019t very strong in the early game. You can abuse this by poking him down and forcing him to recall early.\n\nOnce Malzhar hits level 6, his kill pressure increases thanks to his Ultimate R. Make sure you keep the river warded so you can spot his Jungler before they gank your lane as Malzhar isn\u2019t really able to kill anyone alone.\n\nOnce Malzahar gets an item, his ability to push the wave will become obnoxious. Try your hardest to push the wave back as much as possible so he is unable to roam for free, or take your Tower early."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning. You need to poke the enemy down and delay fights in the late game, but you need to watch your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not get picked off by trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As zilean, Pre-six he is quite squishy, and easily killable if his p is on cooldown. This also makes him vulnerable to crowd control, especially when he is trying to poke with his Q.\n\nHis Q is quite telegraphed and he can be easily punished once his Q is down. Again, his Q can also be dodge by blinking/dashing away from the drop point of his Q.\n\nHe is pretty much a poke/damage bot when his Ultimate t is down. Zilean is inherently squishy so it should not be an issue to take him down once his Ultimate t is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is extremely weak early, try to invade him to place him behind. You are a ganker earlier than Karthus. Try to use your superior ganking potential to get your allies in advance. Post 6, you must use your Ultimate as often as possible. It increases your death pressure and will help you during the ganking. Gank whenever your Ultime is standing and not holding on to it too long. You have several tools to interrupt Karthus Ultime. Use them as soon as you notice it channel its Ultime near you."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar cannot wander as much as the other runners. He is also unable to follow the majority of roarings due to his low potential 1v1. While his Ultimate R is on the cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable to all-in. While you are channeling your Ultimate R, you will be still. This can allow an untargeted champion to fight you or kill you."}
{"text": "As diana, She will have her core items during this phase of the game. Her dueling and pick potential will skyrocket enormously. She should try to fight as much as possible during this phase of the game.\n\nHer win condition will be getting off massive Ultimate Rs off on the enemy team. Poking them out with her Q first and then going in for the kill is quite optimal for her. Bonus points if she can do it from the fog of war.\n\nShe is mighty when dealing with the enemy backline and should always try to find a flank on the enemy's carries. The best time to all-in them will be when the enemy frontline decides to all-in your team. Doing so will ensure that the enemy frontline has no form of follow-up.        "}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia's Ultimate R is an excellent tool in team fights. Struggle 5 champions at a time is a sure way to win the team fight. She inflicts a lot of damage in the prolonged trades as long as she lands her Q. She has to make sure she keeps an eye on her mana pool although she does not run to mana. Cassiopeia can often get early murders in the way with a level 2 all-in. Getting an early murder will make the laning phase much easier for her."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 11 isn't too suitable because she can only roam around and make plays. It will reduce the cooldown but do nothing else damage-wise.\n\nShe starts coming online during the mid-game. Her burst damage is very significant, and she can quickly get picks with her abilities.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level 9. She can deal much damage now, especially when fighting near the objective pits or choke points."}
{"text": "As twitch, His e, when combined with his s attack speed increase is a force to be reckoned with. He can get multiple early kills with this combo (and a decent Support if he is ADC). When in the Jungle, the Red Buff can amplify the effects of this combo.\n\nHis Ultimate c and his Passive allows him to shred through the enemy team with ease when they happen to be grouped together. This gives him a very strong advantage in choke points.\n\nHe can use his s to scout around and set vision for his team as well. Besides that, his k allows for some crowd control set-up for his team which they can follow up on."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Its overall power increases with the number of drakes it captured at the beginning and middle of the game. Therefore, it must prioritize them. Level sixteen is a good peak of power as well. It will strengthen its Ultimate t damage in the game, and it can blow up enemies with ease now. Its overall strength will depend on the construction it goes for. It can either blow up enemies from afar with its AP construction, or it can dive into the enemy team and act as a bruised one."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim is a strong early game Jungler. Try your hardest to gank as frequently as you can to get you and your allies ahead.\n\nAs he is a strong skirmisher, look to invade the enemies jungle to steal away their camps. This will not only reduce their gold income, but it will make you stronger overall and make your mid-game much more effective.\n\nWhile ganking is key, you need to find a healthy balance between farming and ganking. If you focus on one or the other, it will be harder for you to win the game. Actively look for ganks but make sure you\u2019re getting gold and XP too."}
{"text": "As aphelios, The different combinations of weapons available to make you a very versatile ADC that can adapt to almost any given situation (provided you don't fall back massively into the game). AoE damage on your Infernum UltimateRas as well as the potential of CC an enemy team with your Gravitum Ultimate Rmakes you really good during the team fights (especially in closed combat and illuminated). You excel in the extended trades with slight variations depending on your combination of weapons. Combined with the sustenance of the items and your Severum, you can easily turn the tide of a fight if you manage to survive the enemy's attempt to kill you at the beginning of a fight."}
{"text": "As ksante, It's really important that you land these **Q**s early. The cooldown is long early, and if you miss once, you won't be able to get the third pile and CC the enemy that the timer will exhaust. Make sure to keep the minion wave a little earlier. Post 6, you won't be able to engage if you're pushing because you won't be tanky enough to dive the enemy. As you have a lot of CC tools in your kit, you can look to make games with your Jungler."}
{"text": "As diana, Proper warding from the enemy team can diminish Diana\u2019s flanking potential in team fights as she will be detected by the enemy in time. This can really reduce her ability to team fight.\n\nWhen ganking an enemy, if she misses her Q, her gank will most likely fail as she will be unable to use her t twice. She will also miss out on a lot of extra damage.\n\nUnfortunately, Diana relies on getting ahead. If you do not get ahead on her, the likely hood is that you won\u2019t be strong in the later parts of the game."}
{"text": "As morgana, Morgana is decent enough in the team fights because she will be able to run the enemies with her Q and Ultimate R. Her E will allow her to warn her allies of the hard CC and engage. Adding 2 points in her Ultimate R will give her a massive peak of power. She will be able to use the ability frequently, impacting the team fights often. At level 9, her Q will be maximized outside. It will allow her to get frequent catches on the enemy, especially the fog of the war."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Try not to use your Q in the middle of the way to make sure that you can regularly throw several balls of your Q. Use the terrain to browse the map faster using your Passive. Also, use your C carefully as this ability can quickly get you killed for free in the jungle. Your Ultimate R will allow you to travel much more in this game. It will allow you to prevent enemies from entering crucial points such as neutral objective pits or separate enemies."}
{"text": "As sion, Do not play near lane brushes in this matchup. Sion can easily CC you for a long time and you will get burst down.\n\nTry to stay mobile in this matchup as Sion's weakness is dealing with mobile enemies. Also, CC him at the right time to interrupt his Q.\n\nLookout for his ultimate in this matchup. If he goes to some other lane, it is time to shove the wave and get a few turret plates.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As neeko, Neeko is really good in team fighting because of her E and Ultimate R. She just needs to make sure she can reach the enemy team in her Ultimate R channel time. Another point in her Ultimate R will allow her to inflict massive amounts of damage with her Ultimate R. The cooldown will also be reduced. She will have her basic elements now, allowing her to inflict a lot of damage while peeling for her teammates. This will help her team during the fights, especially the fights of choking points."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin will have several objects during this phase of the game. It will allow him to inflict robust amounts of damage while ensuring that his survival is preserved. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This means that he will be paying a significant amount of burst damage and will eventually kill unhealthy enemies by himself. At level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate k. This will allow him to use this ability totally and frequently ruin the ability of the enemy divers to enter his backline."}
{"text": "As rengar, Rengar is pretty weak until he manages to hit level six. He will need to keep track of the enemy Jungler and use the Jungle brushes accordingly to win the early game.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to deal with a lot of damage and help him with his clears. It will also be beneficial when trying to go for all-in combos.\n\nRengar's objective control is phenomenal. Hee can easily gank a lane, get some kills or force them to back off, and then take the objective.        "}
{"text": "As talon, His early game ganks are pretty solid as he can quickly E over walls and catch enemies off-guard. His damage is nothing to be scoffed at either.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive spike. It increases his overall burst damage in the game, and he can easily bamboozle enemies by hiding himself. He can also use it defensively to avoid unfavorable situations.\n\nThe first item component should help him a lot with duels and his clears. His damage output will be really high during this phase of the game, and he can catch enemies off-guard easily.        "}
{"text": "As xerath, Getting 2 points in his Ultimate 2 will make Xerath's damage skyrocket. He can still impact team fights happening far away from him with ease. The only difference will be that he will be more efficient in doing so.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This means that he can dish out a lot of damage with his p and snipe enemies down easily. Immobile enemies will have a tough time dealing with him.\n\nXerath is really good at securing picks with his ranged abilities, and his ability to impact team fights is really high. His AoE abilities make it quite possible for him to take down multiple enemies at once.        "}
{"text": "Against tristana, The longer the game goes and the more gold Tristana has, the stronger she will be. Reduce her chances of carrying by putting her behind in the early game.\n\nIn the right matchup and with an all-in Support, Tristana is really strong at level 2 or 3 when she has her W and may look for an early kill. \n\nOnce Tristana has completed her first item, she will be much stronger and able to trade more effectively. Do not overextend or push too far up in lane if she has the item advantage."}
{"text": "As kalista, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn't be in combat unless you have a clear early advantage (like a commitment support). Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You get extended jobs, so try to go for them frequently. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a golden lead."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Use the lane brushes to get an edge on the enemy laners.

Instead, push the minion wave and start earning turret plate gold.\n\nYou\u2019re going to naturally push the minion wave with your Q. While you\u2019re pushing, keep a constant eye on the map. Heimer is vulnerable to ganks if he doesn\u2019t have his Q turrets up, so keep this in mind."}
{"text": "As shaco, After going in with your Ultimate l, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nLook for picks in the later stages of the game.

He can act as a really potent frontline/disruptor for his team and can go directly for the enemy backline.\n\nHis 1v1 potential is pretty high. He can 1v1 pretty much any Jungler if he has a small lead. This is especially true post 6 with his Ultimate R.\n\nHis Q can allow him to catch up to targets quite easily. This is invaluable when he is trying to pull off a gank or when he manages to catch an immobile champion out."}

It allows him to deal a considerable amount of damage to anyone on the map.\n\nAfter Ezreal\u2019s first back, he will pick up his first component item. His damage output will intensify and he can look for more aggressive plays once he has it.\n\nWhen Ezreal completes his Mythic item, his damage output further grows. A good Ezreal will look to poke the enemy down with his Q before initiating an all-in."}
{"text": "As neeko, Don't fight at the end of the game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when available, because you'll miss extra damage and CC. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooling time in the last stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your ports to keep them alive longer. Your E and Q will help you a lot with zoning enemies out. If your allies quickly die, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Very vulnerable when his E is down. This can allow the enemy of everything in him and kill him quite easily during the early match. His ultimate positioning R can have him killed if his team does not follow him. Moreover, going too deep without any assistance can also have him killed. Pantheon loses most of the levels 6 all-in against the champions with strong damaging Ultimates. This will make his level 6 peak power much weaker compared to many champions."}
{"text": "As kassadin, His early play is very weak and he can be killed countless amounts of time during this phase. If he is not able to get his peaks of the article early, he will take enough time to come online. Can easily camp throughout the laning phase. This can hinder him from CS. This can put him back massively in place. Extremely weak against all-in champions, especially those who have dashes or blinks. He is also vulnerable every time he doesn't have Flash early, so good wave management can really be devastating for him."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Make sure there's always a minion between you and Pyke at all times to make it harder for him to land his Q. Keep an eye on his positioning at all times.

Ping every time he leaves the track so your teammates know he's missing."}
{"text": "As pantheon, It can be very difficult for him to get to an enemy if they have a lot of dredging or dashing tools too, even with his point and click on CC on his W. If Pantheon doesn't advance, it will be really difficult to play in the later parts of the game. It will be quite useless outside his W and E. Unlike many Junglers, Pantheon can't use his Ultimate R in a 1v1 frame. He can't use his Ultimate R in the skirmishes or in team fighting either (although he can start a skirmish with his R)."}

Her W allows her to mitigate a lot of damage, and her E lets her reposition quite quickly.\n\nGwen does deceptively high amounts of damage during this phase of the game due to her items. She will also have maxed out most of her abilities. She can spam her abilities, which directly translates into more damage and healing for her."}

As soon as he uses his Ultimate, try to disengage or reposition so it is harder for him to track the damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "Against karthus, Once Karthus has his Ultimate e, he can impact the map regardless of his positioning. Whenever you\u2019re fighting the enemy, always take into consideration that he may use his Ultimate e to finish you off.\n\nThe more AP and the more magic penetration Karthus gets, the better and stronger he will be. Try to shut him down or constantly invade him to reduce his gold income.\n\nOnce Karthus has completed his jungling item, his kill pressure and ability to gank will increase. This item will give him a lot of AP and the first bit of cooldown reduction he needs. "}
{"text": "As vayne, You should be able to slice through the entire enemy team like a hot butter knife. Just make sure that you don't get mistaken and that you're taken out while doing this, however. You can work with your team to get choices in the enemy jungle, but you should try your best to be in a side lane and drive out negligent enemies who decide to cultivate the side wave. Getting a defensive element should help you increase your survival against bursting damage and assassination attempts. Use your ultimate Invisibility n wisely as well as well as because it can bamboozle enemies quite easily if used correctly."}
{"text": "As veigar, Sacrifice CS for XP in this matchup, otherwise it will easily kill you. You are weaker than them every time they have their Ultimate up. If you are at risk of dying. Remember every time you are weak. To be able to fight Veigar, you need to bait his cage first, then abuse cooldown."}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu\u2019s late game is not bad. He will be very tanky as he would be coming towards the end of his build. If he hasn\u2019t gone full tank, his damage output will be quite good in late game team fights.\n\nAt level 16, Amumu will put the third and final point in his Ultimate y. His Ultimate y should be on a short cooldown and he should have it up somewhat frequently. Avoid fighting unless it\u2019s up in the late game.\n\nTeams will still be grouped closely together in the late game. This is good for Amumu as he will be able to CC his whole team with his Ultimate y."}

Enemy squishies will have an obnoxious time in the game.\n\nHe is solid during late-game fights as his **Q** and **Ultimate** will hit like a truck now. All he needs to do is wait for the perfect moment.\n\nDepending on which build he goes for, he will either be blowing enemies up all over the map or a reliable front linear for his allies. Regardless, his goal is to get into the enemy backline and separate the front line from the backline."}
{"text": "Against camille, Try and stand in the middle of the lane at all times. This will make it harder for her to land her E in a trade. Don\u2019t get close to the walls as this will give her the opening to engage. \n \nIf you\u2019re playing as a ranged champion, try and harass Camille with basic attacks whenever she tries to last hit. Camille lacks sustain in the early game, so you can poke her out of lane easily if you keep auto-attacking.\n \nIf Camille uses her E in lane, she will be vulnerable while it\u2019s on cooldown as it\u2019s her main way of disengaging from ganks. Bait out her E prior to your Jungler arriving in your lane to reduce her chances of survival."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Do not group or fight inside the jungle as it will allow Rumble to get a good Ultimate off.

As you will be quite close together inside the pit, you are allowing him to land a devastating Ultimate on your whole team.\n\nRumble is prone to disengage.

{"text": "Against maokai, Avoid fighting in the jungle as that will allow Maokai to get a good Ultimate R off. Additionally, avoid fighting around neutral objectives like the Dragon or Baron too.\n\nWhen sieging, make sure no one on your team is too far forward as Maokai can isolate them and catch them out of position with his W. \n\nAs it might be hard for Maokai to team fight, he may try to flank from the side to make it easier to get on to the enemy. He may also use his Ultimate R from the side to CC your whole team. Ward the flanks so you can spot him before he initiates."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Do not clump with the minions or stay immobile in this matchup. Failing to do so will get you chunked and CC'd regularly\n\nUse your tornado to keep poking the enemy regularly. Use your Passive shield on the other hand to mitigate the damage that you take while trying to reach them.\n\nYour windwall will be really beneficial in this matchup. Use it to counter Seraphine's Ultimate as much as you can.\n\nKeep the wave in the middle of the lane.

{"text": "As kayle, Stay away from your team and look at the farm and win as many XPs as possible. You need to hit your level peaks as quickly as possible and one way to do so is to stay on a side track. Focus on agriculture and avoid fighting in the middle of the game. If you die or have to burn your Flash, you will be incredibly vulnerable. Split push and stay away from your team unless they need you. You will be stronger if you avoid fighting and grouping unless you have to do it."}

This is because her Ultimate R will now have two points and won't let her or her carries die that easily.\n\nLulu's effectiveness in team fights really comes into play during this phase of the game. Her W and Ultimate R will help her when dealing with enemies who like to flank and get to her backline.         "}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Split push and draw aggro while your team applies pressure elsewhere on the map.\n\nIn team fights, use your empowered E to get picks to start the fight.

Use your Q on the nearest champion to protect yourself and your ADC."}
{"text": "As rengar, Rengar can be really good during the late game if he picks his fight well. He can't blatantly go into the enemy backline and expect to survive without his team following up.\n\nLevel 16 is a massive power spike, which means that he can completely decimate enemies who are singled out. He will need to frequently find flanks on the enemy to ensure that he can take over the game and win quickly.\n\nMost of his abilities will be maxed out by now. His overall damage and sustain will be really high, and the enemy will have difficulty getting rid of him."}
{"text": "As ahri, During the fights, always try to reach the enemy backline by flanking them from out of sight. A sweater can help you with that. If you can't do it, just keep squeezing on the enemy front line, until you can catch someone with your E. Stick with your ADC throughout half of the game. You find it difficult to shoot an enemy unless they are squishy and you are ahead."}
{"text": "As sona, Harass the enemy throughout the laning phase with your Q. Your goal is to constantly harass the enemy whenever possible and get murders. After destroying the tower of the lower lane, turn to the medium track and try to take this tower. This will open the map and give your team a gold advance. Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the goal to make it easier to secure the tower of the medium track. Every time your ultimate R is up, try to use it on enemy travellers to get their weak health. Ideally, harass them first before using it to make it easier for you to kill the enemy."}
{"text": "As zed, Once he uses his offensive W, he has no other form of escape left to him. This makes him vulnerable to the enemy team's ganks and baits. His ultimate R does no bonus damage to an enemy target if he misses his abilities on them, or if his entire damage is absorbed by a shield. It becomes difficult for him to secure the murders later in the game due to each enemy building defensive objects and peeling for their carryings. Team fighting is not his cup of tea and therefore he must resort to split thrust, leaving the enemy team to a numerical advantage."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, In the final stages of the game, be sure to stay with your team at any time. Don't let yourself be taken alone as this can cost you the game. Stay safe and stay with your allies. Don't play very aggressive in team fights. Just kite and automatically attack the nearest enemy champion.

Viego will find it hard to kill you in the way if you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will give him less room for manoeuvre. Make sure there's a minion between you and him at all times. This will make him impossible for you CC with his W."}

This can hamper him from CS\u2019ing and will set him back massively.\n\nExtremely weak against all-in champions, especially ones who have dashes or blinks.

{"text": "As masteryi, His first objective game control is phenomenal, especially if his laners have the priority of the way. He must avoid appearing on the card early, however. Level six is an important peak for Master Yi because he can now gank and clean the fights reliably. Its use will determine whether all the ins are successful or not. The first element is a good peak for Master Yi because it gives him increased damage. He will help him with the cleanings, and his Jungle light."}

Set a good vision around the track and use your k to spot your surroundings before you decide to push the wave. Keep your enemy's reach and continue to throw them whenever an opportunity arises. The best thing to do will be to use your y so that it hits both enemy champions and minions. It will give you the priority to push as well as the commercial advantage. Try to save a k charge for when you crash with the enemy bot track. This will prevent the ADC enemy from dropping the vision into the track brushes."}

This will give a massive boost to his damage and wave clear. In addition, he can now help other laners out frequently and keep his wave shoved in at all times.\n\nGalio will have his core items at this point.

{"text": "As sion, Its tankness will be really high during this phase of the game due to its articles. This, combined with its W, will make it almost indestructible and will allow it to absorb a lot of damage. A completely exhausted maximum Ultimate R will further strengthen its all-in-all potential and the overall damage inflicted in the long term. It will be a massive peak of power for it because it can ensure easy choices with it. It is great during the fighting of the team of the end of the game due to its Q and Ultimate R. Its efficiency increases if it manages to find a flank on its enemies or land its Ultimate R on a group of enemies stuck together."}
{"text": "As fiora, Drop it and look for an all-in-one on Fiora. Failing this can easily help it avoid your ability. Short trades are usually a bad idea for you because of how your kit works and your lack of mobility. Try to reach the enemy's backline when possible to cause chaos. Keep the wave somewhere in the middle of the way. This will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down. It heals a lot so make sure you focus on CC'ing and kill it in a shot fallen with your teammates."}
{"text": "Against nocturne, Nocturne will look to power farm early so he can get level 6. Try to invade him and take away his camps to delay his level 6 power spike.\n\nNocturne will try to get ahead early by ganking lanes that are immobile or are overextended. Try to track him in his jungle and counter gank lanes that are being ganked. If you cannot counter gank, try to gank a separate lane or steal his camps.\n\nDeep wards inside his jungle or around the entrances to his jungle will help your team spot him before he activates his Ultimate a. Try and get deep vision in his jungle whenever possible."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of mana problems in the beginning of the game, but once she gets Tear of the Goddess, she will play a lot more aggressive. Cassiopeia really shines in the end of the game. She swings better than most champions and she can build 6 items. If you get early- Try to close the game as soon as possible. Not many champions are as strong as Cassiopeia is at level 2. Beware of Level 2 all of it with her Q and E spam."}
{"text": "As sion, He is pretty weak before he hits level six. This is because he doesn't have much mobility, and enemies can easily walk away from him if they have a vision of him.\n\nPost-six, Sion gets a decent power spike as he gets a team fight impacting Ultimate R. It allows him to roam around and lane ganks other lanes as well.\n\nThe first item component will give a boost to his survivability and overall damage. He will be able to use his Q from the brushes to CC enemies and then follow it up with damage from the rest of his abilities.        "}
{"text": "As corki, Step away from the minion wave at all times so Corki doesn't land both Q and R on you. Limit the trading cars with Corki as he will win them with his higher AD damage. Every time Corki gets his package, make sure to ping. Focus on agriculture just early so you can be stronger in the later stages of the laning phase."}
{"text": "As ekko, As Ekko is a champion in the middle, he will be harassed by the top range of other mediums. He must not let them bully down otherwise he will fall into gold and XP. Common flank points can easily be monitored by the enemy team, reducing Ekko's flank potential. Ekko will have to spend some time cleaning the pupils if he wants to succeed in pulling enemy champions. Ekko is subject to CC. If he is hit by CC in layers, it will be difficult for him to inflict damage, use his W or escape combat with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As zed, Once he uses his W offensively, he won\u2019t have any other form of escape left to him. This leaves him vulnerable to ganks and baits from the enemy team.\n\nHis Ultimate R does no bonus damage to an enemy target if he misses his abilities on them, or if his entire damage is absorbed by a shield.\n\nIt becomes hard for him to secure kills later in the game due to every enemy building defensive items and peeling for their carries. Team fights are not his cup of tea and hence he has to resort to split pushing, leaving the enemy team at a numbers advantage."}
{"text": "Against briar, By invading a Briar, try to hide in the bushes before jumping on it. Wait for her to use her abilities on the camps and hit her down. If you are weak or you see a weak ally about health stay their welcome, ping and communicate as she will seek to get easy murders with her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Kai\u2019Sa\u2019s early game strength depends on the Support synergy. When paired with all-in champions, she will be good in the early game.\n\nHer level 6 power spike is pretty useful. She can use her Ultimate R to reposition, engage and disengage from fights, and protect herself.\n\nWhen Kai\u2019Sa has purchased her first component item, her damage output will increase. She will be better at skirmishing and trading with the enemy too.\n"}
{"text": "As warwick, Warwick will put the third point in its Ultimate R. It will be on a cooldown low and will be an excellent tool to pick up the enemy in the late parts of the game. Warwick will be very tanky in the game at the end of the season so that he will be able to absorb a lot of enemy damage. At level 14, he would have maximized 2 abilities at this stage of the game. This is a significant power peak for Warwick."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Once it reaches level 3, it could kill you if you are low enough. Its level 6 is good, but it will not be super useful in the skirmishes in the bot track (unless it uses it to start the fight). Keep this in mind when fighting against it. Its first component will severely increase its exit from damage into the track. Its Q will be injured more, and you should invest in additional support to keep you healthy in this way."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ezreal\u2019s first power spike is when he picks up Sheen. His Q damage will increase substantially and he will look to constantly poke. \n \nOnce Ezreal has completed his Manamune and upgraded it to Muramana, his damage output and sustain will be much higher.\n \nWhenever Ezreal has his E, he is much safer and harder to kill. Try to abuse the cooldown whenever you can."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble\u2019s effectiveness is drastically decreased when his Passive is not half filled. The enemy can try to trade with him freely during this point.\n\nHe is quite squishy and vulnerable when his r is on cooldown. This also applies when his weapons are overheated, which provides an opening for the enemy to all-in him.\n\nDue to his immobility, a freeze can ruin his laning phase entirely. This will make him prone to ganks and will not allow him to CS at all. "}
{"text": "As sona, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As viego, Once you get your basic elements, you have to participate in multiple fights. This is crucial for you to take control of the game. Your E will come in very practical while doing games during this period of the game. Always look for opportunities to play around the vision and flank the enemies. Take a good look at what your team is missing during the fights and use your Passive accordingly. Generally, it is better to turn into the most nourished member of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Avoid being struck by his Q in this matchup. You will take a lot of damage otherwise that will force you to waste your W. Always try CC when it's possible. Once CC'd, it is open enough to the all-in of your end. Do not approach it even if you land your Ultimate R on it. It can easily light you up with its Ultimate R if you're not careful. Keep the wave in the middle of the way and try to expose Cassiopeia to ganks as much as you can."}
{"text": "Against illaoi, Illaoi\u2019s R can have a huge impact on team fights. Do your best to disengage if you can when she casts her Ult. In addition to this, do not fight in tight areas as it will allow her R and tentacles to run havoc.\n \nOne of Illaoi\u2019s strengths is that she is difficult to kill once she lands several tentacle slams because of the damage it deals and the sustain it provides. Invest in grievous wounds to slow her healing down. Thormail, Morrello\u2019s, or Ignite will do the trick.\n \nIllaoi\u2019s E creates a spirit of the champion it hits. This spirit is treated just like a champion for the sake Dark Harvest Stacks. Keep this in mind when pulls and Spirit from you or your team."}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu will have multiple items during the mid-game. Depending on his build, he will either deal a lot of damage in team fights, or be incredibly tanky and hard to kill.\n\nAt level 11, Amumu will have 2 points in his Ultimate y. This means his Ultimate y will be on a shorter cooldown which can help him in team fights and help his team get picks.\n\nTeams start to group during the mid-game, and as Amumu is a team fighting champion, he is pretty good during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes lots of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You need to play her a lot to make use of her kit.\n\nWhile Camille is incredibly mobile thanks to her E, whenever it\u2019s on cooldown, she is very vulnerable and easy to take down. Before going in, make sure you check your surroundings as you have no escape when your E is down.\n\nAs she is mechanically difficult, it\u2019s really easy to go wrong on her. If you make a mistake, the enemy can easily capitalise on it and gain a lead. Once Camille is behind, it will be difficult for her to get back into the game."}
{"text": "As lillia, Level 11 will be a decent power spike for Lillia as she will have an upgraded Ultimate R. The cooldown will be reduced, which will allow Lillia to make plays frequently in the game.\n\nHer Q will be maxed out at level 9. This is really good for her as her burst damage will increase exponentially, and she will be a menace to deal with.\n\nLillia excels during the mid-game due to her ability to secure picks. Her Ultimate R should help her a lot in catching out roaming laners and Supports.        "}
{"text": "Against hwei, Stand away from the minion wave so he cannot push and poke you simultaneously.\n\nAbuse his immobile nature by forcing him to over extend, then request a gank and shut him down.\n\nHis E is on a really long cooldown. Try to bait it out, and then look to fight him while his only CC tool is on cooldown.\n"}
{"text": "As varus, Just like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone as you will die easily.\n\nDo not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and auto-attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will focus you and take you down.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, In team fighting, try to lock Kog-Maw as fast as you can. This will reduce his ability to do a lot of damage with his e and self-attacks. Sometimes, Kog-Maw will be left alone with his Support in the medium track. You can abuse that by ambushing both of them when the enemy is divided around the map. From there, you can take targets in the medium track. Positioning is the key to Kog-Maw. If he mispositions or walks too far to harass, make sure to capitalize on it and get him down."}
{"text": "As jhin, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn't be in combat unless you have a clear early advantage (like a commitment support). Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You get extended jobs, so try to go for them frequently. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a golden lead."}
{"text": "As lucian, Heavy power spike at level two which allows him to run an enemy down with his E, Q combo. This combined with his Passive and Summoner Spells may easily get him a kill on a squishy target.\n\nReally good wave clear with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This causes him to gain priority really fast and it also helps him secure objectives with his Jungler.\n\nPost-six, he can practically one shot an enemy with his combo while simultaneously re-positioning with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to evade ganks with ease."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Don't try to hunt Zeri down the jungle or river because she probably waits for her E to be back and she will use it to escape. Look for the fights when she's not around. Her Ultimate R is really useful in the fights, so fighting when she's not there is favorable. Ward your flanks in the middle of the game! Zeri can use his E to close the gap of a wall and surprise himself on your team."}
{"text": "As briar, During the middle of the game, you just have to look for picks all around the map. It's time for the track swaps so it should be easy for you to get killed. Still target carries as much as you can. They can't do much to save themselves and you'll be able to escape with the help of your Ultimate R. Look for the sides of the enemy team and see if you can catch them out of sight using the fog of war. This will make the team fights really unfair for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As nami, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game.

Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As malzahar, It is fragile early because its presence is negligible, and its capabilities are telegraphed. All it has to do is to maintain its health and use its passive until it reaches level six. Once it reaches level six, its presence will skyrocket, becoming a major threat to the enemy's lantern. Working with the ally Jungler will help it massively. The first element will allow it to spam its abilities quite frequently. It will also allow it to inflict more damage, especially when it has its final R."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ensure that you\u2019re always stood behind a minion at all times to make it harder for him to land his Q and poke you down. \n \nThe best time to go for trades and land skill shots on Ezreal is when his E is on cooldown. If he ever uses it aggressively, try to abuse the cooldown and look for an aggressive play while he\u2019s defenceless. \n \nIf Ezreal uses his Ultimate R to snipe someone on the map, ping your team as it moves across Summoners Rift. This will allow them to dodge the incoming ability. While this ability is on cooldown, you could look to play aggressive and try to fight him."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Avoid team fighting in the late game unless your Ultimate R and Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass is up. If you try to team fight when either one of them are down, you will be rather vulnerable.\n\nUse your abilities in the late game to peel for your carries to keep them alive. Use your Ultimate R on the nearest enemy champion and focus them down first.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Do not leave them and go to split push as the enemy may force a fight while you\u2019re gone. Stay grouped, but be prepared to stay off to the side and out of vision."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Destroying his E barrels before he can detonate it can take a lot of damage off his kit. It forms a major part of his early game damage and without it, he will just be stuck farming and occasionally helping his team with his Ultimate R.\n\nHis W is an important spell in his kit and he is very weak once that ability is down during the early game. He becomes really prone to ganks when this ability is down and he can\u2019t really escape without using summoner spells.\n\nFighting in open spaces reduces the effectiveness of Gangplank as he won\u2019t be able to use his E barrels to the fullest potential. The same thing applies to his Ultimate R. He can\u2019t initiate an all-in without his Ultimate R during the early game as well."}
{"text": "As sion, An additional point in his Ultimate R will boost his overall damage and let him use the ability frequently. It will help him massively during team fights or when trying to secure picks.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level nine. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be pretty respectable now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability while hiding in a brush.\n\nHis tankiness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will soak up both tower shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow up on his engagement.        "}
{"text": "As ivern, Continue to look for picks with your Q and R. If you\u2019re able to get a pick, try to abuse the numbers advantage and finish the game.\n\nAgain, stick with your team and avoid walking too far away from them. If your ADC gets caught out, then the chances of winning will be reduced. So by sticking with them you\u2019ll increase your chances of winning.\n\nContinue peeling for your team in team fights. Make sure you keep them alive for as long as possible."}
{"text": "As varus, Focus on poking down the opposition with your Q and W. It should be pretty easy for you once you slow them down with your E.\n\nYou are highly immobile so it should be important for you to take some countermeasures against ganks.

This will help you get kills and burst down enemies with your obnoxious Q damage.        "}
{"text": "Against rumble, Let him push the wave of the minion and capitalize on the immobility he is to force him to exceed the extension. Then, all-in-all, or make your Jungler for the gank while it is too wide. Watch to abuse his E and Q cooldowns as often as possible. It lacks damage without these abilities."}
{"text": "As urgot, He becomes vulnerable when his Q and E are down in the track. In addition, he is likely to be poke in the track if he finds himself against a varied laner. Unlocked during the late part due to his enemies building defensive items and so on. Moreover, his Ultimate R can easily be cleaned up with a Quicksilver Sash, thus denying the threat of ability. Extremely motionless when his E is down, probably by making the best time to exchange with him. Even in team fighting, if he tries to enter with this ability, it can be completed quickly."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, Nautilus is a good ganker early because he\u2019ll unlock his g very early on. He has the potential to gank at level 2 too.\n\nAt level 6, Nautilus becomes very scary as his Ultimate e is point and click CC. Expect him to gank whenever his Ultimate e is up.\n\nThe more items he gets, the harder he will be to kill. Keep this in mind and try to deny him farm, XP, gold and resources to reduce his effectiveness in the later parts of the game."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, As the game progresses, use the d to create an area around which you can fight effectively. Try to move as much as possible. Your d > e combo should quickly allow you to all in any unsuspected enemy lantern and allow your ally to follow the engagement. Your duel power will increase massively once you get your Ultimate m. Make sure you use it to peel for your ADC most of the time."}
{"text": "As shaco, Remember that Shaco is an expert in enemy selection during this phase of the game and the enemy team will certainly try to turn. Be a part of neutral objective fighting and make sure you can use your Ultimate I from a safe place to prevent enemies from getting closer to your team. During team fighting, make sure to assassinate the enemy backline. You can even use your clone to separate the enemy front from the backline."}
{"text": "As sett, You will want to get to level 3 quickly and utilize the fog of war to gank overextended enemies. This will allow you to get a quick early lead which you can capitalize on later on.\n\nYour W will be of paramount importance in this game. Make sure that you time it correctly, as it can be the difference between a won and a lost fight.\n\nAlways try to gank pushed-up enemies but make sure that you are not on the opposite side of the map when a neutral objective is about to spawn. Otherwise, you will lose an easy objective.        "}
{"text": "As pantheon, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your advance quickly enough. Every time your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive games around the map. Your Ultimate R is an excellent tool that you can use to help your allies win their way. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you continue pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As milio, Poke with your Q as much as you can, but focus on harassing with autos as much as you can. If you miss your Q, the enemy will just all-in you and kill you.\n\nYour main focus in lane should be to peel and protect your ADC as much as possible. If you or they fall behind, it\u2019s going to be harder for you to win the lane and the game.\n\nKeep an eye on your positioning in lane. Try to adapt your positioning accordingly and play around where your ADC is stood at all times. If you\u2019re too far back, they will struggle to farm and you\u2019ll have no priority in lane.\n"}
{"text": "As poppy, Very strong all-in potential with her E. This when combined with her Q slow, can allow her to lock down an enemy for quite some time.\n\nHer W is the bane of any champion with dashes, especially all the carries who are reliant on their dashes.\n\nHer Ultimate R can allow her to turn the tide of a fight almost immediately as it can turn a 5 v 5 into a 5 v 2 easily. It also acts as a great source of disengage for her."}
{"text": "Against karma, Karma may leave her team to ward alone. Try and catch her out of position by setting up an ambush and then take the Baron or Dragon while she\u2019s dead.\n\nIf Karma uses her empowered Q when trying to poke, you should use the cooldown to start a team fight. When Karma\u2019s Ultimate a is down, she cannot give her team a huge shield d which will make fighting much easier.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to invest in an Executioner\u2019s Calling. It will reduce her healing and shielding and it will make winning the team fight a lot easier."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Unless you have an advantage, do not fight Xin Zhao in the early game. His 1v1 is incredibly strong thanks to his Q and E and he will win most skirmishes.\n\nTo make it harder for Xin Zhao to get successful ganks off, make sure you place vision around his jungle entrances. This will give your allies enough time to back off and escape before he is able to reach their lane.\n\nXin Zhao has good objective control and can take them pretty easily. Make sure you keep the Dragon warded at all times so you can spot him before he is able to take it."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Darius can start ganking as soon as he hits level 3. He needs all of his basic abilities before he can start to gank.\n\nHis best early game power spike is when he hits level 6. His Ultimate e heavily increases his 1v1 and skirmishing power and he will be a huge threat at this time.\n\nAfter he has completed his first component item, Darius\u2019 trading and kill pressure further increases. He can 1v1 most enemy Junglers at this time."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Don't fight in the late part unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available because you're going to lack a lot of potential to kill pressure. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the final stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your efforts to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "Against nami, Nami will walk up to you and use her W on herself (or on you) in poke attempts and bounce the wave. Don't stay in the range of her so she can't get health again via bounce. When you poke Nami, don't walk directly back as she can easily Bubble Q you. Instead, try to walk on the side."}
{"text": "As braum, Just like the mid-game, teams will be grouped during the late game. Braum is going to be very strong in late game team fights.\n\nAt level 13, Braum will max out his E. He will be able to speak up a lot of damage for his carries during the late game.\n\nAt level 16, Braum will put the third and final point in his Ultimate r. It will be on a rather short cooldown which can allow him to start team fights on enemies who are caught out of position."}
{"text": "Against briar, Her first peak of power, like many Junglers is at level 3, where she unlocks her basic abilities. Fighting for the first crab can be dangerous! When Briar reaches level 6, her real inflation potential comes to light, and she will look for gank and help her allies from afar. She is good in the middle of the game, and if she gets an early lead, she will be strong during this game phase."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo will place Shrooms t around the edges of the track. Avoid walking on the side of the track and only walk on the path that your minions take to reduce the damage taken. Concentrating Teemo down is a great way to win this matchup. It is super squissy and easy to kill if you play around its t. Playing around its t is very important. If you do it, it will exceed you every time."}
{"text": "As leesin, It is a very good early game ganker due to its aggressive ability and style of play. This means that its presence will be felt early, and it will capitalize on the enemy's glove and get an early lead. Level six is a massive power peak as it adds another layer of damage to its global damage combo. It can also interrupt Teleports and can act as a multi-CC capability. The first element will allow it to get a boost of damage and increased survival during all in. It will give it more chance to get a murder during a duel."}
{"text": "As corki, During the half-game, Corki will have finished several articles. He will have a lot of poke during the half-game too. This makes him quite good during this stage of the game. At level 9, Corki will maximize his b. His clear wave and the ability to push the enemy in their turn will be constantly high enough. If he is laning vs. a heavy roam champion, he will force them to stay in their way. At level 11, Corki can put a second point in his ultimate e. This will increase his clear wave and poke."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, At level 9, Jarvan will get his first ability maxed out. This will give him a massive damage boost, impacting fights at a much higher level.\n\nOnce Jarvan gets to level 11, he will put two points into his Ultimate m. This will increase the damage of that ability while simultaneously reducing its cooldown. This will allow Jarvan to look for picks more often.\n\nJarvan IV is good in team fights due to his d Passive and his ability to CC multiple enemies at a go with his d > e combo. His Ultimate m will also allow him to single out enemies which need to be dealt with quickly."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio should be finished now. This will give it a massive peak in its ability to peel for allied carts. Its damage production will be quite high as well. The Ultimate R of Galio will always be practical during the fights due to its knockup and low cooling. It can easily divide the thrust and show up to fight with its Ultimate R in a jiffy. Level 16 is not so great a peak for Galio. Although its Ultimate R cooldown is reduced and the range of casting is increased, it will have no incentive to use it for itself."}
{"text": "As garen, When there is no team fight, push and draw the enemy's attention to you while your team sits or plays on the other side of the map. Look for choices with your Q and R. Garen deals a surprising amount of damage, so don't be afraid to move around the map and try to assassinate someone with your team. Garen is a heavy, skirmish laner."}
{"text": "As alistar, The first power peak of Alistar is once it reaches level 2 because it will have access to the two main CC tools that it needs to start the skirmishes with the enemy. First level 2 and unlock your two W and e is crucial to gain an early advantage. After Alistar has taken his boots, it can start running freely around the map. As it has a lot of pressure to kill, it should seek to wander when opportunities arise. At level 6, Alistar can go for more risky coins thanks to the added protection that his Ultimate provides it. At this stage of the game, it can look for potential diving opportunities at the bottom or midway."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive games. You enjoy extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.

{"text": "As ashe, Your immobility is the clearest weakness you have: both during the laning phase and in the team combat phase. This puts the extra task of making sure that you are well positioned during the fighting as an error can cause you to kill. The enemy team will look to you gank several times during the laning phase to recover you. Although this does not affect your utility, you will not be able to get enough elements to impact the fighting later on on which will cost your team multiple fights and goals. Every time your Ultimate w is down, you have little or no detachment."}

Do not go for extended trades with him as he will always come out ahead. \n \nDarius will look to reposition when using his e. Try and stay in the inner ring so it doesn\u2019t deal much damage.\n \nDarius is relatively immobile and weak when he is getting attacked by multiple champions. Let him push, poke him down and then request a Jungle gank for a guaranteed kill."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, The second point of his Ultimate R will allow him to shoot down targets quite quickly. He will also be raised frequently, which will make it easier for him to choose a target. The first ability will be maximized at level 9. He will face a lot of burst damage due to it and decimate any enemy who gets shot at him. He should have his basic items now, which will make him uber-powerful. His constant damage and the absorption of damage will allow him to take the front line and fight easily."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, It does not do well in the prolonged automatic attack trades. Wait for her to waste her C or Q and then use the cooldown to play aggressive and kill her. Taliyah does not have access to a harmful Ultimate R at level 6. If you are a champion with a strong Ultimate, try to abuse her weakness at that time. When trading with Taliyah, always keep behind at least 1 minon. It will make it very difficult for her to do damage with her Q."}
{"text": "As aphelios, After Aphelios\u2019s first back, he would have picked up his first damaging item. He can look for more favourable trades with the enemy once he has purchased his first component item.\n\nWhen Aphelios has hit level 6, he gets his first major level power spike. Unlocking his Ultimate R offers him a lot of trading and kill pressure.\n\nAfter Aphelios has completed his Mythic item, he\u2019ll be comfortable winning trades with the enemy. This is especially true if he gets his Mythic item before the enemy ADC."}
{"text": "As zed, Once he uses his W offensively, he won\u2019t have any other form of escape left to him. This leaves him vulnerable to ganks and baits from the enemy team.\n\nHis Ultimate R does no bonus damage to an enemy target if he misses his abilities on them, or if his entire damage is absorbed by a shield.\n\nIt becomes hard for him to secure kills later in the game due to every enemy building defensive items and peeling for their carries. Team fights are not his cup of tea and hence he has to resort to split pushing, leaving the enemy team at a numbers advantage."}
{"text": "As leblanc, This champion is mechanically- very difficult. You\u2019ll need a lot of games to master this champion.\n\nThey will run out of mana quickly, so you need to always keep an eye on your mana bar.\n\nIf you\u2019re behind, you\u2019re going to deal no damage in team fights and you poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "As tristana, Level six is a massive power peak. It allows it to use capacity as a finishing movement if it can get the enemy quite low with its E. It can also be used defensively in some cases. The first element will help Tristana win battles easily. Its damage will be amplified by a fairly decent amount."}
{"text": "As twitch, This is the point in the game where the champions will start to regroup. This makes it really good for Twitch as he can use his Ultimate c effectively. Level 11 is a power peak as he will get two points in his Ultimate c. He will also have several articles, which means that he should be able to eliminate a lot of damage with ease. His first ability will be maximized at level 9, which means that he will do a lot of damage now. Combined with his Passive, he should play a pivotal role in destroying the enemy team."}
{"text": "As jax, The first element of Jax allows him to chase the enemies during a prolonged fight. He will let him stack his passive and completely decimate his enemies. Going to regular trades of short burst will help him a lot. Level 6 is a decent peak of power because it will increase his survival during the fights. Once he will have more elements, this ability will help him kill the enemies with ease, and he will be able to resume the game with his scaling. Jax is not very early because he is dependent enough on the article. He should focus on agriculture and short skirmishes to clean up the murders."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Xerath\u2019s early game poke can be really hard to deal with in lane. Be prepared to take extra sustain so you are not forced to recall early on.\n\nOnce Xerath is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate 2, he will have a lot of poke and extra damage. Do not over stay in lane post 6 as he might be able to snipe you.\n\nWhen Xerath has his Luden\u2019s Echo, it will drastically increase his poke and pushing power. Avoid staying in the minion wave so he is unable to poke and push at the same time."}
{"text": "As sona, Consider investing in healing reduction items or abilities to counter Sona's sustain. This can help reduce their ability to heal and trade effectively during skirmishes and all-ins.\n\nMaintain the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This encourages Sona and their ADC to overextend, creating opportunities for your jungler to gank and potentially secure kills or summoner spells.\n\nTake advantage of windows of opportunity to detach from your ADC and harass Sona when they've used one of their abilities. This puts them at a disadvantage in trades, as they have one less ability to trade back effectively.\n\nBe cautious at level 6, as Sona's kill pressure increases with her ultimate ability. Expect them to look for aggressive plays and be prepared to play defensively, utilizing Yuumi's healing and utility to keep your ADC safe."}
{"text": "As karma, Stay with your team in the late game. Getting caught out will result in the enemy forcing a fight or taking the Baron. Avoid straying too far away from them.\n\nProtect your allies as much as possible in team fights. Keeping them alive for as long as possible while dealing damage will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nIn team fights, use your empowered d to provide a large shield to your allies. Unless you need to use your Q or d, you should try to use your d to help them survive."}
{"text": "As orianna, Do not fight as a team in the later parts of the game unless your Zhonyas Hurglass and Ultimate d are both in place. Delay / disengage fighting if the enemy wants to fight you. Poke and delay team fighting while you and your team harass the enemy and lower them. Once they are low, engage yourself. You can also look for choices with your abilities to catch someone who is out of position. Stay with your team in the late parts of the game. If you are caught or the enemy launches a fight while you are not there, the enemy will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As rell, Rell's level 11 is a decent powerspike because of its ability to put 2 points in its Ultimate R. It will be able to use the ability to draw all-in successes frequently now. Its selection potential will be really high during this phase of the game. It is particularly true if Rell works with his Jungler to put in place death brushes in the enemy jungle. The presence of Rell team combat will be felt through the board due to its t and Ultimate R. It can quickly get a stunning multi-man using its all-in-one combo."}
{"text": "As corki, Try and roam around the map and help your allies. Push the wave and then roam.\n\nWhen using your abilities on the minion wave, try to aim your b and e so it hits both the enemy and the minion wave at the same time.\n\nTry to find a healthy balance between poking the enemy and using your abilities to farm with. Ideally, do both throughout the early and mid-game."}
{"text": "As sylas, His early game ganks are phenomenal as he can quickly get on enemies with his W and E. Ganking overextended enemies will help him a lot.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike for him, but the power will totally depend on the enemy team's composition. He will have to ensure that he takes the proper ultimates to be effective in the game.\n\nThe first item component will bolster his overall damage and will let him take over fights with ease. It will also help him with his Jungle camps and his overall survivability in the game.        "}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early will help reduce Xin Zhaos killing pressure in the way and increase your chances of surviving in bad matches. Investing in the reduction of healing will help you a ton against Xin Zhao because it tends to have a lot of hold in the way and throughout the game. Xin Zhao is strong in early play. Expect him to go for aggressive coins in attempts to get an early lead."}
{"text": "As kassadin, After six, he can start avoiding the ganks and can wander around and try to get the murders. Once he gets the snowball roll, it is very difficult to stop him, especially if he reaches level eleven. Excellent potential of burst damage on an ill-placed enemy. This becomes extremely strong from level eleven, and can practically a target shot."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, A good Xin Zhao will use their Ultimate whenever it is up to gank an ally. Make sure you gank as much as possible, too so you can apply just as much pressure as them.\n\nXin Zhao is a weak early game champion. This makes them vulnerable to invades by you and your team. Try to invade Xin Zhao as much as possible.\n\nAs you\u2019re great at duelling and strong early on, try to make early plays around the map to get yourself and your allies ahead.\n\nAs Xin Zhao has strong invade potential, it is crucial to ward your jungle entrances so you can spot them before they invade your jungle and kill you."}
{"text": "As varus, Avoid going for prolonged trades in this matchup as they will always win them. Beware of their high level 6 level all-in because they are really strong at level 6. Likewise, beware of strong trades early with them. So back off that they can't harass you for free. Focus on agriculture and pokings in the early game. Try to match their push power and keep the minion wave slightly closer to your side of the map, but not under your turn."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Poke the enemy and harass them as much as you can before trying to fight. Bursting someone with some Q.S. and your R will allow you to force a team fight with numbers or health advantage. Avoid using your E aggressively in the end-of-game fights that you will be vulnerable briefly. Use it only aggressively if you are 100% sure you can not be abused for it. Stick with your team and avoid walking too far from them. If you are caught out, your team will lose on a lot of damage in a team fight, and that would be your fault."}
{"text": "As lucian, Once Lucian unlocks his 3rd stage Ultimate R, he will be able to bring tons of constant damage, especially to low health targets. This will make it easier for him to break up enemies. Lucian will have access to several articles during this stage of the game.

It will allow him to systematically and will allow him to reposition himself frequently."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Once Xerath is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate 2, he will have a lot of poke and extra damage. Do not over stay in lane post 6 as he might be able to snipe you.\n\nXerath is good in team fights as long as he is able to poke and harass with p before a fight starts. He is not very good in team fights if he is unable to poke beforehand. So, make sure you engage as soon as you spot him.\n\nAs Xerath will be building AP items even though he\u2019s in the Support role, he has similar power spikes to Mid lane Xerath."}
{"text": "Against orianna, Orianna fights against the almighty. Try to integrate it when her Ball is far from her. Pay attention to the location of Oriannas Ball throughout the laning phase. Position yourself away from him at all times so that he must go further to hit you. At level 6, stay away from your ADC as much as possible. If you are close to them, the enemy can be able to CC both when they throw their Ultimate d at you."}
{"text": "Against taric, At level 6, Taric has a lot of protection added thanks to his Ultimate R. At that time, killing him or the ADC enemy will be difficult. Once he activates his Ultimate R, you may need to disengage from the fight unless you can kill the enemy. Taric is really good in the middle and the end of the fights of the game team because his team will be grouped closely together which allows him to get a good Ultimate Roff. According to his ADC, Taric can be really good at levels 1-3. If his ADC is not very strong, then his early game is not too good. However, when he is associated with an early dominant ADC, you will need to look at your positioning in order not to land an Early E."}
{"text": "Against teemo, At level 6, the pressure of Teemo's increases thanks to its Ultimate t giving it additional damage and the ability to place mushrooms {{championSpells.TeemoRCast} all around the map. The more the haste capacity Teemo buys, the more Shrooms t it can place around the map. Try to take a non-orthodox path to prevent walking through them. Nashor's Dent is a central element for Teemo. It gives it a lot of additional statistics- which makes it more of a threat."}
{"text": "As zyra, Work with your Jungler and Support to keep your major goals and place the vision in the high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them guarded so you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving the card alone so that you are not taken out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Don't keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible."}

You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower.

You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "Against irelia, Irelia is very strong whenever she has her Passive fully stacked. Avoid fighting with her at this time.\n \nWhen Irelia hits level 6, her kill pressure intensifies as her Ultimate R is a very good duelling tool.\n \nIrelia benefits from extended trades, so try and avoid going for them whenever you can. Keep them short and sweet."}
{"text": "Against annie, Every time Annie has her trick available, you have to respect it and play slightly safer. If you are melee, step back and wait for her to consume it before walking forward.

Annie is prone to poke even if her E offers her some protection in the trades."}
{"text": "Against zed, By invading the enemy Zed, try to wait inside a bush or enter on it only when it is low in energy so that it finds it difficult to exchange with you.

He has still not reached his final form yet, though.\n\nRyze will struggle during mid-game fights as his damage won't be enough to one-shot enemies. He will have to be careful about getting CC'd as well.        "}
{"text": "As shen, His tankess will be gargantuane during this phase of the game. He will not take much damage and will act as a reliable front line for his team. A maximum-out Ultimate R will help him save his allies frequently. He will also allow him to share the push very effectively, as he can join a fight from anywhere on the map. He is decent in late fighting due to his kit, because he can play both aggressively and defensively at the same time. His ability to not cause damage will be the final nail on the coffin of his enemies during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "As naafiri, As suggested, she is a snowball heavy champion, so if you do not get an early lead, it will be hard to carry later on.\n\nShe suffers against teams that are smart and group together.

Gank whenever your Ultimate is up.\n\nFocus on securing those objectives. You must take Rift Heralds and Drakes whenever you can.

{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is perfect during this stage because team fights often happen, which gives him multiple targets to land on his abilities. As a result, she carries tons of damage while healing in a major fight. Gwen will get a massive boost to his combat power at level 11 due to her Ultimate R now having two points. This is very beneficial for his team as this ability causes a lot of damage and can completely change the tide of a fight."}
{"text": "Against sett, Sett will look for an early cheese. Stay as far as possible at levels 1 and 2 so he can't use his Flash and kill you. At level 6, Setts Ultimate R is strong enough.

If you play as a varied support, try to harass him as much as you can to make it really difficult for him to engage without dying."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia runs out of mana incredibly quickly if she spams her E when trading. She needs to keep a constant eye on her mana pool otherwise she will have minimal lane pressure.\n\nCassiopeia is one of the most immobile champions in the game. This makes her a prime target for ganks and teams with good dive potential.\n\nWhen against mobile champions like Talon, Lee Sin, Rengar, it will be really hard for her to land her Q, make use of her W and escape a trade. She struggles against fast-moving enemies."}
{"text": "As kayn, At level 16, Kayn will have his Ultimate R maxed out completely. This will directly fortify his ability to all-in enemies and kill them due to his burst damage.\n\nKayn will have multiple items by now. This is good for him, depending on his form. He can assassinate people if he goes for the Blue Form, while he can act as a frontline if he goes for the Red Form.\n\nDepending on the form and build, Kayn will either be a killing machine due to his burst damage or a tanky, unkillable frontline who will easily peel for his carries."}
{"text": "As nasus, Interrupt him whenever he tries to CS. Making sure that he can't stack his Q is of paramount importance.\n\nIf he uses his W on you, jump out of the fight immediately to keep yourself safe.\n\nYou are really CC heavy so focus on making plays in other lanes. These unexpected ganks can easily get you and your team some free kills.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and ask for ganks. Make it a point to initiate the fight though, as your CC is more reliable."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Focus on farming and hitting level 6 as quickly as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your ganking potential.\n\nYour Ultimate t is an incredibly strong tool.

If you can, try to keep them warded at all times if you\u2019re not in a position to take it yourself."}
{"text": "As vladimir, Does not have any form of gank agency so probably will not get a gank during the early match. It is rather weak early as well and is quite useless if the game does not continue for too long. Misuse of his l can have him killed immediately, especially if the enemy is running on their ability to control the main crowd. This can make him a very easy gank target. Wounds grise you are a jerk to his existence, especially if it is acquired early. This weakness can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage over him due to the reduced Q health."}
{"text": "As taric, Once Taric gets 3 points in his Ultimate R, he will have a really easy time fighting with enemies. The brief period of invulnerability can easily win Taric's team the game.\n\nTaric is quite decent in team fights. This is mainly because of his Ultimate R, which allows him to defend high-priority targets while the enemy team takes damage.\n\nTaric is also quite tanky during this phase of the game because he will have many items now. This will make him an effective peeler for his ADC and his team."}
{"text": "As aphelios, At level 6, you\u2019re both very strong and both your Ultimates will be quite powerful and the difference between winning the fight.\n\nKeep the minion wave close to your side of the map to force Aphelios to overextend.

{"text": "As rengar, He is the number one public enemy for any squisshy wear in the game. He can practically a-shot them with one or two articles and can tilt someone hard enough to win the game easily. He can use his Passive with his Q to kill unsuspected enemy junglers and wear in their Jungle. He can also gank with his Ultimate R and Passive. His early duel power is really strong, especially if he is in the front line and has access to the track brushes. He can throw a snowball this way, which can easily allow him to win matches."}

Use your Ultimate R on the nearest enemy champion and focus them down first.\n\nStay with your team at all times.

{"text": "As rumble, You will want CC Rumble when possible in this matchup. Its cars don't do much damage but only go to CC it when it doesn't use any ability. Keep an eye on your allies in this matchup. If you see someone is low and in a skirmish, then they will immediately. It will certainly try to distinguish you in this matchup with its Ultimate.

This makes it hard for him to survive the laning phases against champions with a lot of burst damage and poke.\n\nCompared to other ADCs, Corki\u2019s mobility tool b has a really long cooldown early. Only use it aggressively if the enemy Support has CC tools on cooldown, or else you\u2019ll be over extended and easily killed."}

Akali and assassins like his fight against the teams with a lot of CC. In the team fights, you will have to wait for the perfect opportunity to enter to not get CC. Akali is one of the most difficult champions to master in the game. Playing around his energy levels, his Passive, his W and his two mobility spells takes a lot of practice. Expect to put in a lot of effort if you want to learn Akali."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, His b is probably one of the most feared abilities in the whole game. A b from the right angle is enough to win a fight with ease completely. His Ultimate d is very beneficial against shielded targets. This combined with his b makes him an ideal choice against enchanters, and he can easily win the way by using these abilities. The amount of Blitzcrank card pressure can exercise with his speed of movement e increase, and his b, t CC capabilities are unmatched by anyone. He can even annoy the enemy Jungler by delaying his early camp and/or putting in place a death brush later in the game."}
{"text": "As rengar, Level 16 is a massive peak of power, which means that it can completely decimate the enemies that are identified. It will frequently have to find sides on the enemy to make sure that it can take the game and win quickly. Most of its capabilities will be maximized by then. Its overall damage and maintenance will be really high, and the enemy will have difficulty getting rid of it."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Use your Q for Aatrox poke regularly, it will prevent him from looking for all the in and causing you damage. Your E can be used to slow down Aatrox, which makes it harder for him to sue you and easier for you to avoid his E. Use your W to trade with Aatrox, it will help you to poke down and reduce his hold. Also get some serious injuries. Be aware of the ultimate of Aatrox, try to prevent him from being killed and use your R to interrupt it."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan can look for an early aggressive play once he unlocks both his Q and his E. He can look for an aggressive play if he has been able to bully the enemy down at level 1.\n\nOne Akshan has backed and picked up his first component item, his damage output and ability to trade increases. He should look for aggressive plays once he has brought his first component item.\n\nLevel 6 is good for Akshan. This is because he unlocks his Ultimate. It can help him secure kills and execute the enemy laner.\n"}
{"text": "As twitch, His Ultimate c allows him to shred through the enemy team if they happen to be grouped closely together. This makes Twitch very good in choke points.\n\nHe can use his s to scout for his team.

In an extended trade, he can easily kill someone if he is able to auto-attack them for free."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Kayn will try and fight as much as he can in the early game so he can get his form quickly. Keep this in mind and be prepared to fight back.\n\nBecause of Kayn\u2019s Ultimate R and mobility, make sure you watch yourself as you recall, and make sure you stand in the middle of the lane so it\u2019s easy for you to escape if he springs up nearby. Don\u2019t give him easy kills by window shopping when you recall.\n\nOpt for early sustain. Kayn has a lot of sustain in lane thanks to the items he buys and his E. Having sustain that matches him will make the laning phase much easier."}

Once she reaches level 6, expect her to look for killers in the way or set up her Jungler for the ganks. Her Ultimate R is a strong tool that offers her pressure to kill extra. Every time she uses her W, she will be vulnerable to an all-in-one. He has a really long cooldown, so try to abuse it if possible."}

Keep the wave close to your turn as long as possible."}
{"text": "As gangplank, When no team fights are occurring, split push and draw the enemies attention to you while your team sieges or makes plays on the other side of the map.\n\nMake sure you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can upgrade your Ultimate R and earn more gold.\n\nKeep a constant eye on the map during the mid-game so you can assist your allies with your Ultimate R when appropriate."}
{"text": "Against reksai, A laner should always prepare for a Rek-Sai at level 3 because they are very likely to ruin one of the tracks. When Rek-Sai touches level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate r, it inflicts even more damage and can drag the majority of the Junglers without they escape. After Rek-Sai has finished his juggling, his pressure of death increases considerably. At this point, it will be difficult for you to fight it unless you are in advance in terms of articles and murders."}
{"text": "As ornn, The second point of its Ultimate R will increase the damage to the ability and allow it to play games frequently. Several articles will allow it to absorb a lot of damage in the fighting. It should be part of as many fights as possible. The first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will cause a lot of damage to the enemy team and increase the frequency of use of this ability. Anyone near the terrain will have a difficult time."}
{"text": "As gnar, Once Gnar\u2019s E is down, he becomes susceptible to ganks, so if his opponent manages to bait it out, he will have a really hard time escaping out of that situation.\n\nGnar\u2019s Ultimate R won\u2019t be very effective if the enemy is playing in open spaces and is spaced out evenly. This will force him to go for a higher priority target which may involve flanking the enemy team, which can cause him to get caught out and killed.\n\nThe enemy can completely counter him by choosing to disengage when he gets his mega form. Once his mega form is down, the enemy won\u2019t be under the looming threat of getting ulted into a wall by him, and hence will be able to fight more freely."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas succeeds in reaching level 11, it will have two points in its ultimate R. This means that it can launch battles and move key enemy targets much more frequently. At level 9, Gragas will have its first maximum ability. This is really beneficial to it because the increase in damage will really help it to duel. It is especially true if Gragas goes for the complete AP construction. During the middle of the game, the enemy will be busy exchanging tracks and defining the vision. Therefore, as Support, Gragas should work with the Jungler to invade the enemy Jungle and kill such targets."}
{"text": "As gragas, Use your rotation of abilities on protecting and peeling for your carries. If they die, the likelihood of you winning the team fight will be lower.\n\nOften the enemy will be mispositioned in the late game. Use this to your advantage by knocking in the enemy carries with your Ultimate R. Catching them out of position will make winning late game team fights much easier.\n\nLook for picks in the late game and around objectives. Then use the numbers advantage to start another fight or secure an objective."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia's Ultimate R is an excellent tool in team fights. Struggle 5 champions at a time is a sure way to win the team fight. She inflicts a lot of damage in the prolonged trades as long as she lands her Q. She has to make sure she keeps an eye on her mana pool although she does not run to mana. Cassiopeia can often get early murders in the way with a level 2 all-in. Getting an early murder will make the laning phase much easier for her."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, His waveclear and burst damage is impeccable. He can also keep poking the opposition with his W and set some Q turrets in the lane brushes/around him to prevent all-ins.\n\nHe can push up freely as long as he is in the cover of his Q turrets. These turrets, when combined with his E, can allow Heimerdinger to turn an enemy gank into an easy kill for him.\n\nHis Ultimate R provides him with a lot of versatility. He can use his empowered Q to take down turrets and enemies, his empowered W to take down low health enemies, and his empowered E to set a multi-man, long-ranged CC which can allow his team to follow up on his CC."}
{"text": "As ashe, You should focus on initiating fights with her Ultimate w from now on. It will let your team follow up on the CC, while the short cooldown means that getting high-priority picks will be extremely easy.\n\nYou will be dealing a lot of damage during this phase of the game as well. You will be acting as a secondary ADC for her team, but you should focus on spamming her y to soften the enemies before going in for a kill.\n\nPositioning will mean a lot for you during this phase of the game. You can do whatever you want to do while staying in the backline and deal with the enemy closest to you as you are really immobile."}
{"text": "As belveth, Your goal in the early game is to gain as much gold and Xp as quickly as you can. \nYou wanna prioritize ganking lanes with low mobility or for allies with early CC as the strength of your basic abilities at level 3 and 4 is pretty significant.\n\nTry and secure early objectives as you can take them pretty quickly and if you kill them you can turn into your True Form as use this to take down any nearby enemies.\n"}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus has insane late game damage if he has been able to get tons of stacks with his Q.\n\nIs an easy champion to pick up and understand. His game plan is pretty much the same in each game too. \n\nNasus is a really good split pusher and should be looking to split push and open up the map during the later parts of the game. He can be incredibly hard to stop if he is ahead. While he is drawing pressure, his team can siege or fight elsewhere."}
{"text": "As kayn, Try to use the track brushes and go for short gusts when the enemy has a capacity down. Do not overextend in this other way, you will end up getting killed due to ganks. If possible, ask your Jungler to gank you early on a few times. If you succeed in accumulating an advance, you should quickly take the game from there. Getting your shape will be massive for you. Depending on the shape you get, you should increase your fighting frequency accordingly. This will help you to snowball the game quickly."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Hit level 2 first and then use your level advantage to gain a meaningful health advance. You are weaker than them each time they have their Ultimate Up. If you are at risk of dying, always remember at level 5 so that you are not killed when they have reached level 6. Think twice before using your dash in this matchup. If you go ahead, they could all of you, or the enemy Jungle could appear. Look what happens on the map before leaving forward. Kassaddin is very good for roaming."}
{"text": "Against kennen, Kennen is really good in team fights. Avoid fighting in the Dragon or Baron pit as it will allow him to get a good Ultimate m off.\n\nKennen is prone to peel and disengage. Try to disengage as soon as you see him running towards you. Additionally, make sure you have vision to the side of you in case he tries to flank.\n\nTry to harass and poke Kennen as much as you can before a team fight occurs. If you can keep poking him down, he will be unable to engage and fight if he\u2019s low on HP."}
{"text": "As volibear, If they invade you early, right back. This is especially true if they are early, because you won't win early fights with them Be proactive with your Ultimate, because they will seek to use theirs every time it's up.

You need to take Rift Heralds and Drakes when you can!"}

Do not fight when it\u2019s on cooldown as you\u2019ll miss out on a lot of extra damage.\n\nIn the late game, stick with your team and look for picks with your Ultimate R. If you\u2019re able to catch a squishy champion out of position, you can take them down and win the fight."}
{"text": "As gwen, Do not over-commit in this matchup else you will end up dying and giving up free objectives to the enemy team.

{"text": "Against anivia, If you don\u2019t know where Anivia is, it\u2019s plausible that she is hiding in a bush waiting for you to walk up before bursting you down with her t and e. Keep this in mind when returning to lane.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about Anivia\u2019s Passive. It has a long cooldown, so once it\u2019s been popped, make sure you try to kill her while she is most vulnerable. Call for assistance and ask for ganks while it\u2019s down.\n\nTry and hold off from using any dashes that can help you dodge skill shots.

{"text": "As olaf, See if you can get roaring over the overstretched enemies in the middle lane. Your t can allow you to decimate the still champions if they find themselves being too pushed up. Getting your Ultimate k will allow you to take over the skirmishes quite easily. The anti-CC look will allow you to all enemies in the enemy rear line. Work with your Jungler to get some picks around the map. Your t and Ultimate k should allow you to run the enemies with ease."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Make sure you are present during the team fights. This will allow you to peel for your portages and prevent them from dying directly at the beginning of the fight.

Doing so will allow you to take neutral goals easily."}

{"text": "As thresh, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cass is a late-game monster. As long as she hasn\u2019t fallen behind, she will be incredibly strong in the late game.\n\nAt level 13, Cass will max out her Q. Pairing this with her E max, she will be able to deal a lot of damage in a skirmish.\n\nAt level 16, Cassiopeia will put the third point in her Ultimate R. It will deal a lot of damage, stun the enemy for a long period of time, be on a short cooldown and have the potential to win her team the game."}
{"text": "As ksante, Roll around the map and search for peaks with your Ultimate and use the incredible amount of CC you have to help your team get killed. Peel for your carts in team fights. Clean up the damage and let them down the damage. You can also use your Ultimate to isolate and remove key damage dealers. Don't forget to farm. You need to find a healthy balance between the side lanes of agriculture and team fights with your team."}
{"text": "As katarina, She is countered heavily by CC, especially the ones which have no cast time. If she doesn\u2019t use her r properly, then she will end up dying a lot due to being CC\u2019d.\n\nShe relies on the lack of vision to roam around and acquire kills. If the enemy team sets up proper vision and has enough map awareness, they can easily stop Katarina from getting a lead.\n\nMispositioning and using her Ultimate R at the wrong time can make her quite an easy target for the enemy. Her Ultimate R roots her in place, so she can be targeted by a CC chain."}
{"text": "Against sett, Once Sett is level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate R, its ability to get killed in the way also increases. Look at your positioning and disengagement if you are weak as his all-in-one combo inflicts a surprising amount of damage. In the middle of the game, Sett will be hard to fight unless you are early or you have help. Avoid fighting and disengagement if he runs on you and tries to fight you."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand has lots of poke with his W with the added benefit of it being long-ranged too. This allows him to poke the enemy down from afar and get them low. \n\nHis Ultimate R is really good in team fights- especially if the enemy are grouped together. He can make his Ultimate R bounce between enemies and deal a lot of damage.\n\nBrand is able to complete his warding quest incredibly quickly as he can constantly harass the enemy from afar."}
{"text": "As sivir, The final point in her Ultimate R will secure more picks in the later parts of the game. The goal is to ensure a pick on the enemy Support or Jungler and get a neutral objective after that.\n\nHer overall damage will be really high during this phase of the game.

{"text": "As malphite, Can absorb a lot of damage for his team with his passive. This allows him to be a first line for his team while also being able to escape from death when he enters with his Ultimate h. After six, he can set up several ganks for his track as well as other tracks with his Ultimate h. This is very beneficial if the track that he is gaunting has a certain form of CC built in their kit. He is the jerk of all immobilizers, especially the various immobilizers. He can quite easily get on them and prevent them from doing anything in a fight. If Malphite goes AP, there is no enemy carrier for most of the game."}

He can also use it to interrupt abilities and enemy dashes."}
{"text": "As amumu, Try to feed the farm to level 6. This will help you unblock your Ultimate there quickly and will allow you to start inflating your tracks. Every time your Ultimate is up there, you should try to inflate a way. Each Ultimate use should lead to a murder there. Try to inflate as soon as your Ultimate comes out of cooldown. After successfully inflating the lower lane, make the call to take the Dragon. Getting all Dragons will give you an early soul and deny the enemy a variety of buffs."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's Ultimate R will really shine during this phase of the game because it can now impact team fighting whenever this ability is rising. Moreover, it really works well when its target is the one that has to approach the enemies to attack them. At level 9, its Q will be fully maximized. This will give a massive boost to its damage and clear wave. Moreover, it can now help other washers frequently and keep its wave shoved at all times. Galio will have its basic items at this stage. This is beneficial to him, and his team as its overall production of damage and survival will be higher."}
{"text": "Against talon, When teams are grouping, make sure you ward your flanks to spot Talon before he is able to jump over the wall and assassinate your team.\n\nAs soon as Talon engages, try your hardest to burst him down before he is able to disengage and deal lots of damage. \n\nAs Talon is an assassin, expect him to look for picks with his Ultimate R.

{"text": "Against sylas, To make it hard for Sylas to land his E on you, always make sure you\u2019re behind at least 1 minion so he cannot land the CC on you.\n\nLook for extended trades after Sylas has wasted an ability. This will make it harder for him to out trade you in a skirmish. Look out for his Passive though and try to wait for the stacks to disappear before committing to a trade.\n\nSylas has really good map pressure and can roam with ease. If he has left lane and started roaming, communicate with your team and push him in to deny him gold and XP."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Work with your Jungler and see if you can secure some picks around the map. Getting a kill is good but you can also try to force the enemy to recall.\n\nYou're extremely fragile and will probably die if you get caught out, hence make sure that you use your E with discretion.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on an extremely short cooldown now so use it as much as you want to help your teammates out.

{"text": "As nocturne, It is fragile before six because it has no way to get closer and closer to its enemies. It should powerfarm as much as possible.

{"text": "As yasuo, Once Yasuo reaches level 11, its Ultimate R will have two points in it. This will allow it to inflict more damage and will also allow it to deal with tanks more efficiently than the game continues. At level 9, Yasuo will have maximized its r. It is an excellent peak of power for Yasuo because its damage production increases massively and its tornado r increases considerably. The brushes of the track will help you a lot with that too. Its peak of power mid-game also depends on his team comp. Yasuo will be able to do much more in the game with ease if the Yasuo team has a form of knockup on one of their champions."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, Malzahar is not very strong in early play and can be made weaker by destroying his passive shield every time he gets up. As soon as he gets it, pop the shield must play even safer. Malzahar will seek to push the wave constantly once he has an object. Avoid standing inside the minion wave at any time so that he can't sting and push at the same time. Once Malzahar reaches level 6, you will have to play more respectful than he will tend to get ganks once his Ultimate R is in place. Every time he has his Ultimate R up, make sure you have quarters in the river so you can spot the Jungler before they reach your path."}
{"text": "As azir, The early game should be focused on farming. The main goal is to get your first item quickly while making sure you don't get CC'd and all-in'd. Use your W and r with the utmost discretion.\n\nShove the wave when possible and punish the enemy laner with your soldier-directed auto-attacks. It will slowly allow you to get a healthy lead in the lane after which you can either look to all-in or roam.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to do a lot more in this lane.

Use the fog of war to do so.\n\nIf you happen to see someone careless enough to be sidelining alone, just go and kill them. This will allow you to get a numbers advantage and make a fight unfair.\n\nGetting a defensive item like a Zhonya's should help you a lot with surviving your all-ins. It also bolsters your tankiness, so you may want to think about buying the item."}

Make sure you\u2019re always behind at least 1 minion so he cannot push and poke you at the same time.\n \nCorki can be really good in the mid game and in those team fights. Make sure you shut him down early so he isn't very strong during the mid or late game.\n \nOnce Corki completes his first item, he will deal a lot of damage and will look to be more aggressive. Keep this in mind when trading."}
{"text": "As kalista, Kalista's Ultimate x will be useless unless her Jungler comes to gank. To compensate for this, she should use the lane brushes and early skirmishing power to poke the enemy team out.\n\nThe first item component will only add to Kalista's overall dueling and skirmishing potential. It will let her dominate the lane provided that she properly uses her Passive.\n\nMultiple points in her r will make her powerful in two departments. She will be able to run down enemies with ease. She will also be able to take neutral objectives reliably."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Every time he has 3 Q laps up, he will always be a threat.

Only do so when you are ahead though, else your laner will easily take your tower.\n\nDuring fights, make sure that you use the fog of war to your advantage and keep flanking the enemy team.

{"text": "As quinn, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your advance quickly enough. Every time your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive games around the map. Your Ultimate R is an excellent tool that you can use to help your allies win their way. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you continue pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As aatrox, In the later parts of the game, stay with your team and look for picks. Avoid separating or being too far from them as the enemy can force a fight while you are nowhere near. Play around your ultimate R and avoid committing to fight while it is on cooldown. If you fight while it is on cooldown, you will miss a lot of additional healing and damage, which can make the difference in a late team fight. In team fights, flank the enemy to make it easier to access the enemy rear line. Positioning away from your team but close enough to join the fight could give the enemy a false sense of security, making it seem that the fight is 4v5: forcing them to expand."}
{"text": "As ashe, Your initial plan will be to play the lane safely and not get cheesed early on by the enemy Jungler. Set proper vision around the lane and use your k to scout your surrounding before you decide to push the wave.\n\nMaintain your range from the enemy and keep poking them whenever an opportunity arises. The best thing to do will be to use your y in such a way that it hits both the enemy champions and the minions at the same time. It will give you push priority as well as the trade advantage.\n\nTry to save an k charge for when you skirmish with the enemy bot lane. This will prevent the enemy ADC from dropping vision in the lane brushes. Also, always keep your Q charged up as you don't know when it can come in handy."}
{"text": "As katarina, When Katarina reaches level sixteen, she will be powerful because of her Ultimate R. This will help her clean up the game easily. Katarina deals a lot of damage during the late game due to all her articles. Its damage can burst enemies and carriers at once. Since it is the late game, the enemies will have a lot of defensive items. This means that Katarina will have a hard time killing them. Playing around the vision should help a lot with that."}
{"text": "As xayah, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, Extremely squishy and immobile early on which can make him sensitive to the ganks due to the way his kit works. This will force him to play defensively, otherwise he will just be camping. Misuse of his d can cause a lot of problems for him. Junglers will wait for him to have this ability on cooldown before they try to gank him. Locking inappropriate cards for inappropriate times can also cause a lot of problems. Misuse of his Ultimate can get both him and his team killed there, which will eventually lead to a massive throw. This is due to the fact that Twisted Fate is a macro-based champion, and the proper decision-making is necessary to play this champion effectively."}
{"text": "As drmundo, His objects will make him very tanky during this stage and combined with his passive and ultimate R, he will be a behemoth for the enemy team. It will be almost impossible to take him down and therefore he will be able to completely separate the rear line of the enemy team from their front line. He is at his strongest when his ultimate R is in place. He can plunge the enemy team and completely disturb their team by walking towards them. Dr. Mundo's Q can allow him to secure catches for his team. The slow can allow his team to follow this target with difficult CC capabilities, or even straight up and explode them."}
{"text": "As lucian, The level 2 of Lucian is a decent peak of power because it allows it to go for a devastating total combo. The damage inflicted is relatively high, and it can quite quickly kill the enemy with multiple combo rotations. Level 6 is a significant peak of power, especially when Lucian is against an immobile port. It should have an easy time to release waves with it as well if it has to remember. The first element will be a massive peak of power for Lucian because it allows it to do a lot of damage. It will give it an inherent advantage, especially if it can capitalize on its level 2 peak of power."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "As olaf, He will fight against champions sorted with dashes because they will be able to kite and avoid his T-Axes. When Olaf's Ultimate k is down, it will be really motionless and can easily die. Without its Ultimate k, it is also very squishy and easy to kill. If you miss your t when you run out of breath with the enemy, it will be impossible for you to kill them or expand the trade. Make sure you try your hardest to land your T-Axes."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's damage will increase a lot once he has his first element. This will allow his Q and E to hit like a truck during all in. Once Galio reaches level 6, he unlocks the ability to make cross card games around the card. This is advantageous for his team and will allow you to impact the game much more. Since Galio has a limited range, he will have a difficult time early during the game. However, he can use his Q to bypass this. Using his Q, he should try to hit the enemy champion for bonus points."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, In team fights, use your authorized E to get choices to start the fight.

{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan has an incredibly strong level 2. This allows him to get ganks cheesey out of the medium track or bot once he has unlocked his two d and e. He is quite mobile and is able to escape many trades. He can also use his mobility to pass over the walls and dodge commonly placed desks. He can many times gank the tracks more and more thanks to his relatively low cooldowns. Moreover, once he is level 6, he can gank overheard or immobile tracks with his Ultimate m that will usually result in murder for him or his ally."}
{"text": "As karma, Whenever Karma\u2019s d is down, she is vulnerable to attack and will need to play safely while it\u2019s on cooldown. Karma is squishy, and if she looks to fight when it\u2019s down, she is going to come worse off than the enemy. \n\nUnlike most champions, Karma unlocks her Ultimate a at level 1. This means that at level 6, she doesn\u2019t have as much pressure in comparison to a lot of other Supports. Pre-6, this isn\u2019t a problem though.\n\nIn team fights you need to ensure that you use your empowered d on your allies and avoid using your Q. Using the wrong empowerment can cost you the team fight. "}
{"text": "As reksai, Her early ganks are pretty good as she can find creative gank paths easily. She needs to make sure that she is not detected beforehand, though.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent spike as it is a good finishing move. The goal is to either get kills on low health targets or avoid CC and get to the enemy backline.\n\nThe first item component will help in duels, and the Jungle clears. It becomes pretty easy for Rek'Sai to move around the map quickly.        "}
{"text": "As naafiri, Keep playing around goals like the Rift Herald and the Dragon to keep your team forward. Make sure to also use your Ultimate and constantly looking for ganks with it. Supports will start walking on the card alone in the middle of the game. Capitalize on this to get you killed for free."}
{"text": "Against amumu, Once Aumu gets tons of cooldown reduction, his Ultimate will be on a shorter cooldown. This allows him to gank more often and have more success when it comes to deganking. Depending on the construction, you will need either to invest in a armor pen if you are an AD champion, or a magic pen if you are an AP champion. If it will damage, you may need some defensive elements. As the game goes on, it will become stronger and stronger, and tankier and tankier."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn's Q is a powerful tool in the way. It can completely deny the ability to self-attack one or more enemies. Winning its E is a significant peak of power in the track. This ability makes it very slippery and a threat to manage. Getting its ultimate R unlocks Quinn's roaming potential."}
{"text": "As sejuani, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing up. Fighting with outside will make the fights of the late game team much harder. Delay fighting and be ready to disengage if it's still on cooldown."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Pick fights when Tryndamere is nowhere near his team. This will make it easier for your team to win the game and secure objectives.\n\nIf Tryndamere engages in a team fight, lock him down with CC and blow him up before he has a chance to activate his Ultimate e.\n\nHis pick potential is actually pretty good. Avoid walking around Summoners Rift alone if you\u2019re squishy as you\u2019ll be an easy target for him."}
{"text": "As shaco, He isn\u2019t only a threat on a physical level, but the mental warfare he instills upon the enemy squishies allows Shaco to make multiple plays which other Champions can\u2019t make. He can leave the lane and roam quite easily to get a cheese gank off (even if he is laning).\n\nHis x can allow him to disengage as well as surprise all-in champions easily. This also acts as a counter to carries who have dashes and rely on kiting to win fights.\n\nHis e allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease. When combined with his Ultimate l, his enemy can be baited to attack the clone and CC the enemy team/champion that attacked it."}
{"text": "As draven, Draven will be able to shoot at a single shot from the enemy in the last game as long as he looks at his positioning and is not caught. At level 13, Draven will maximize his second ability. This is great for Draven as it will allow him to offer additional protection in the last game. Draven, level 16 is pretty good. The additional damage that his Ultimate t offers will come to him in practice and allow him to execute enemies. As his Ultimate t is an AOE capability, he will also inflict damage to several champions at once."}
{"text": "As zeri, Being part of the fights is mandatory during this phase of the game. Make sure you use your E carefully as not doing it can cause you a world of pain. Your Ultimate R will be powerful uber during this phase of the game. The goal is to make sure that you can target as many people with the Ultimate R explosion and then increase the distance with your E. Get a defensive element during this phase of the game if the enemy team has a lot of assassins and tanks. You will want to use your Q regularly to win fights."}
{"text": "As yone, Once he reaches level 16, he will use his ultimate R way more frequently. This means that he can easily choose enemies, as well as several CC enemies during the team fights. Yone will have all his articles finished by then. This means that he will hit like a truck, and whoever gets caught by him will probably die. Yone is superb at the end of the game because his articles will be finished, and he will have reached his most powerful powerpike. If the enemy team finds himself being CC-heavy, he should get a defensive element to preserve his power."}
{"text": "As shaco, After entering with your Ultimate I, be ready to fold and peel for your allies ith your x in the team fights at the end of the game. Look for picks in the later stages of the game. If you can choose someone, you should turn to the Baron or the Old Dragon. Keep a constant eye on what main goal is then spawning and make sure to keep them half a minute in advance. Do not divide, push or go to the opposite side of the map when an important goal is high or about to spawn."}
{"text": "As drmundo, His tankness and health regeneration are unrivalled and quite valuable during the end-of-game fights. He can act as a really powerful frontline/disturber for his team and can go directly for the enemy backline. Being pushed into the tower is not a big hassle for him because of the ease with which he can grow under his turn. The enemy must think twice before diving him because he can regenerate a lot of health in a few seconds with his Ultimate R. His Q can allow him to catch targets quite easily."}
{"text": "As rengar, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will give him a huge boost and allow him to easily blow up simple targets. Rengar is quite decent in a team struggle, especially if he manages to use a brush frequently. His burst damage will allow him to get rid of enemies quickly. Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability quite frequently. This means that he can both zone out of enemies or secure picks as needed."}
{"text": "As rammus, Rammus really has good ganks once he has unlocked his t. It should have a high success rate when gauntling his allies. Thanks to his l, Rammus is incredibly tanky. This means that it can always be the front line his team needs regardless of the distance or behind it is. Rammus Extreme 2 is on a short cooldown and can be used to get choices. This will allow you to gank a track, push and then try to take the tower."}
{"text": "Against evelynn, Evelynn\u2019s early game is very weak and she will be power farming till level 6 so she can become invisible and get her Ultimate R. Try and invade her jungle and steal away her camps to delay her level 6 power spike. \n\nPlace Control Wards in the river and go for deeper wards rather than relying on shallow ones. This will help you spot her before she gets the chance to become invisible. Placing wards on her camps are a good way to counter her.\n\nEvelynn wants to assassinate targets that are alone. Group as a team to make it harder for her to execute and kill squishy champions."}
{"text": "Against zilean, Avoid regrouping too closely as this will allow Zilean to land a good dizziness with his Q and potentially start the team fight. Playing around Zilean-S Ultimate t is crucial to winning fights. Try to force the fights when his Ultimate t is on the ground. If Zilean is in the middle track with his ADC, you could try to ambush both and then force a goal like the middle lane tower, Drake or Baron."}
{"text": "As trundle, Focus on early agriculture. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP. However, if you find an opportunity to sow or counter-gang nearby, don't be afraid to take it. If they invade you early, just back; you don't win early skirmishes with them. Try to secure these major goals when you can, as you have decent objective control."}
{"text": "As talon, Get to level 3 quickly, and make sure you use your E to catch enemies off-guard. You should have a significantly easy time dealing with pushed-up enemies.\n\nEarly kills should come quite easily to you. Focus the enemy bot and mid-lane as they have the squishiest targets and will let you snowball hard.\n\nYour Ultimate R should allow you to make a lot of plays all around the map. You can even use it defensively if things go awry.        "}
{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze\u2019s laning phase is when he is at his weakest. Avoid trading with him too much in the very early game as he will just want to recall early and get his Tear anyway. \n\nWhen Ryze hits level 6, his kill pressure doesn\u2019t increase as his Ultimate R is not a damaging tool. For most champions, your level 6 will be stronger than his.\n\nTry to fight as often as possible. Ryze needs time to scale, so delaying his ability to scale is key. Getting an early kill and putting him behind early will reduce his ability to scale into the mid and late game."}
{"text": "As teemo, Your goal in the early game is to play safe, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy laner. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online.\n\nOnce you have quite a few levels under your belt, you should look for short favourable trades. As you\u2019re not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in lane."}
{"text": "Against swain, If you play as an early game champion, try to get an early advantage to reduce his scale. His Root E will only trigger on the first enemies he hits on his return. Stand by your Caster Minions and walk forward when he throws him so that the minions get CC.D and not you. At level 6, his pressure of death and survival increases. Unless you have the advantage, turn off as soon as he activates his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As viktor, Abuse his weak early game to gain an advantage.\n\nAfter he gets an upgrade, stand outside of the wave to reduce his poke and wave pushing power.\n\nBait his CC tool before going in for a trade or all-in.\n\nBe prepared to sacrifice CS for XP to stay safe and level up in lane."}
{"text": "As sion, Its tankness will be really high during this phase of the game due to its articles. This, combined with its W, will make it almost indestructible and will allow it to absorb a lot of damage. A completely exhausted maximum Ultimate R will further strengthen its all-in-all potential and the overall damage inflicted in the long term. It will be a massive peak of power for it because it can ensure easy choices with it. It is great during the fighting of the team of the end of the game due to its Q and Ultimate R. Its efficiency increases if it manages to find a flank on its enemies or land its Ultimate R on a group of enemies stuck together."}
{"text": "As naafiri, At level 16, you\u2019ll put the third and final point in your Ultimate. You will be rather strong and your all-in potential will be high.\n\nIn the late game, you\u2019ll start to fall off a bit as teams will be grouped so you need to play with your team. The enemy grouping together will reduce your chances of getting picks.\n\nNaturally, you\u2019ll have many items completed, or are full build at this stage of the game, so you should be able to deal a lot of damage and survive fights.\n"}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 11 is not a massive spike as it gives only a measly increase in the ability's damage. That being said, the lower cooldown certainly helps.\n\nPantheon is pretty decent during the mid-game. This is because he can dish out a lot of damage in a short time and can secure picks all around the map.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This means he can deal a massive amount of burst damage to any enemy he gets too close to."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Don't look for fights in the jungle or around the Dragon or Baron. That's because the teams will usually be grouped closely together- which allows him to get a good **Ultimate** off. Instead, try to fight in the open air in a way. Poke and disengagement are the biggest threats. If you can, try to bring it down as much as possible before a team fight happens to make it almost impossible for him to engage without dying."}
{"text": "As rammus, Rammus is really tanky during the end of the game. It will not take much damage but can come back a lot of damage if the enemies attack him regularly. A maximum-out Ultimate 2 will allow Rammus to take full control of a fight. Since he can use it frequently, the peaks will be aplenty. Rammus is pretty decent in the fights at the end of the game due to his ability to choose enemies easily. He should focus on ensuring that his allies are not killed by the flanks to ensure an easy victory."}
{"text": "Against brand, Avoid fighting in tight quarters such as inside the jungle or around an objective. This will make his Ultimate R a lot less potent. With that said, when grouping try not to group too close together so he cannot bounce his Ultimate R between multiple champions either. \n\nIn the later stages of the game, Brand will go and ward objectives alone. Use this to your advantage by setting up an ambush and taking him down before an objective spawns.\n\nBrand will try to deal a lot of damage and delay a team fight for as long as possible while poking you down. To prevent him from destroying your health bar, you need to fight him as soon as you see him."}
{"text": "As camille, In the last game, Camille is good at choosing champions with his Ultimate R. It should be on a cool down low and if you are able to Ult R the right champion (like a cart), you could win the game. Although you have a good potential of choice, the enemy will start building defensive statistics that will make it harder for you to kill the carts on your own. Keep this in mind when you dive with your E. Although you will find it harder to kill carts on your own, you will be quite tanky and will suffer a lot of damage thanks to the items you buy."}
{"text": "As kalista, Your r will hit like a truck and will allow you to quickly take neutral goals. Take all the goals of the map and do nothing that could have the chance to get you killed. Get a defensive element when possible. This should help a lot if you manage to take a bad step during a major skirmish. Enter only when the enemy has used all the primary forms of CC. You will be a prime target for the assassins, so make sure you are careful during the fighting. Also, use your W carefully to cover your flanks when you are lucky to do so."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in its Ultimate R. As long as it can get the channel out, it will be very good in the late part. The teams will continue to group in the late part. This will allow the Fiddlesticks to get a good amount of damage to the entire enemy team. While you are good in the late part, you are incredibly squishy. Lookout and be careful trying to get a good Ultimate Roff so that you don't get killed before a fight breaks out."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia\u2019s first significant power spike is when she hits level 3. While she can dish out a lot of damage at levels 1 and 2, she becomes much stronger when she has access to her basic abilities.\n\nThe next major power spike for Cassiopeia\u2019s is when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Her Ultimate R is very versatile and can be used to either engage or disengage from a fight. It can also be used to set up her Jungler.\n\nCassiopeia\u2019s will start to do a lot more damage in trades when they\u2019ve picked up their first item. Landing one Q and then following that up with multiple E\u2019s should give you a severe health advantage."}
{"text": "As sylas, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies forward. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure to try to exploit your early advantage. Look to secure the goals whenever they're. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes. Find a healthy balance between your allies, farming your jungle and security goals. Make sure you don't fall back in XP trying to gank constantly."}
{"text": "As garen, Prolonged trades are a way to go into this matchup. Keep the brushes guarded as Garen can try to drop the vision on you. Don't let him close in peace and keep hitting him whenever he goes for the last time. Short trades are usually a bad idea for you because of how your kit works and your lack of mobility. Try to reach the enemy rear line when possible to cause chaos. Keep the wave somewhere in the middle of the track. This will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down."}
{"text": "As vi, Vi's selection potential will still be preserved during this stage of the game. It should be able to enter the backline and lock high priority targets with ease as well. It will now have three points in its Ultimate R. This means that Vi can easily use the ability to lock enemies in a frequent way. Any squishy enemy target will have a hard time playing the game. This is the point of the game where Vi starts to fall. This means that it will have to focus on the coat for its ports or act as an activator when possible."}
{"text": "As kalista, During the mid-game, try to take as many fights as physically possible to make use of your skirmishing power. While fighting, ensure that you don't go too ham and abandon your frontline.\n\nYour Ultimate x will come in handy during this phase of the game as you can quickly start engages with the ability. Use it on the tanky person of the team for maximal effectiveness.\n\nYour W will help you prevent an untimely demise that occurs on face checking a brush. Use the W to cover the back of the objective pits during neutral, objective fights.        "}
{"text": "As swain, Your E and W will be pretty crucial towards winning this lane. Try to land it when the enemy is about to last hit a minion.\n\nYou will want to be a part of as many skirmishes as possible. This is because your AoE abilities will completely dismantle the enemy team.\n\nYour Ultimate R will help you a lot during this phase of the game. Try to use it if you feel that you're about to get ganked or all-in'd.        "}
{"text": "Against nocturne, In the mid-game, avoid splitting up by staying as a team. Nocturne has great pick potential and will try to kill squishy champions who are on their own thanks to his Ultimate a. \n\nWhenever Nocturne is split pushing on the other side of the map, he has no way of getting to his team quickly. If you see him somewhere else, look to engage and start a team fight.\n\nNocturne will try to take down the squishiest high priority target at the start of the fight. This is usually the Mid or ADC. Clump together in team fights to reduce his one-shot potential."}
{"text": "As reksai, Look to take down the enemy carries. Focus the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them with your other frontline champions.\n\nAs you\u2019re the Jungler, you need to make sure you\u2019re always alive in the late game. If you die before a major objective spawns, the enemy will be able to take it.\n\nMake sure you are always on the side of the map that the next major objective is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show yourself, the enemy will take the objective for free."}
{"text": "As pantheon, The first element will allow him to inflict more damage and spam his abilities due to the increased mana. Level six is a massive peak due to his ability to get his Ultimate R. This will allow him to play around the card and get his team before. He is really a great starter champion that his damage bursting during the start of the game is phenomenal. Anyone who is still will have problems with him."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao's early game ganks are on another level altogether. If he manages to find Flashless overextended laners, the chances of them dying are almost a solid 100%.\n\nOnce Xin Zhao gets access to all his basic abilities, he will start ganking laners when he gets an opportunity. His knockup is incredibly potent to ensure that enemies can't escape and that his allied laners can follow up on him.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent power spike as he can immediately convert a skirmish into a 1 v 1 with a specific target. This will allow him to burst enemies down while giving him immunity from ranged attacks outside his Ultimate R AoE."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Use your Q to poke Aatrox regularly, this will prevent him from looking for all-ins and dealing damage to you.\n\nYour E can be used to slow Aatrox, making it harder for him to chase you down and easier for you to dodge his E.\n\nUse your W to trade with Aatrox, this will help you to poke him down and reduce his sustain. Get some Grievous Wounds as well.\n\nBe aware of Aatrox's ultimate, try to prevent him from getting kills and use your R to interrupt it."}
{"text": "As sona, If you wanted to, you could get some early healing reduction items to help cut down on Sona's healing. It will make killing them a lot easier too.\n\nEnsure that the minion wave is positioned nearer to your side of the map so your Jungler can gank your lane and easily kill Sona.\n\nTheir Ultimate offers them a ton of additional kill pressure. Play smart and recall when you\u2019re low so Sona cannot use their Ultimate to execute you.\n\nBait out abilities before looking to fight Sona. They can turn around exchanges, and to make trading more favourable, you should wait for them to use one of their abilities before fighting them.\n"}
{"text": "As malphite, Can absorb a lot of damage for his team with his passive. This allows him to be a first line for his team while also being able to escape from death when he enters with his Ultimate h. After six, he can set up several ganks for his track as well as other tracks with his Ultimate h. This is very beneficial if the track that he is gaunting has a certain form of CC built in their kit. He is the jerk of all immobilizers, especially the various immobilizers. He can quite easily get on them and prevent them from doing anything in a fight. If Malphite goes AP, there is no enemy carrier for most of the game."}
{"text": "As sion, Stay grouped with your team. Do not leave the side of your carries otherwise, the enemy will capitalize on the fact and leave them helpless.\n\nPeel for your carries in team fights. After using your Q, fall back and protect your allies and focus on the nearest champion.\n\nLook for picks with your Ultimate R. If you can catch someone out when the enemy is unorganized, you\u2019ll be able to force a team fight or an objective afterward."}
{"text": "As nunu, Look at the most allies you can to make sure you can help your teammates. This will allow you to take squishies really easily. Be part of neutral goal fights and make sure to put in place death brushes with your Ultimate R. Since you're building AP, you're about to blow everyone up. Look for peaks in the middle of the game. It should be easy enough for you because of your W & E. Don't forget to heal with your Q."}
{"text": "As graves, His first ability will be maximized at level 9, which will help Graves strengthen his overall burst by fighting with the enemies. He will be able to clean the minions very quickly. Thanks to his articles, he will have a lot of pressure to kill during the middle of the game. His e and e will also allow him to catch the out-of-guard enemies, and he can kill them very quickly because of his passive. This will be applicable mainly to objective and piled combats. At level 11, Graves will have two points in his Ultimate t. This means that the potential of this ability ending the ill-health enemies increases considerably, especially if he is on his way to building the lethality."}
{"text": "As rell, Rell has an incredibly strong level 2, make sure to hit Level 2 first and look for an aggressive game. Staying healthy is the key when you play Rell. If you're piqued down, you'll never be able to engage. When you're waiting on your cooldowns, play safe and out of the automatic attack range. Use Rell , strong roaming ability to move around the map and help your allies."}
{"text": "Against varus, Post 6, avoid overextending when you\u2019re defenceless. Varus\u2019 Ultimate R can be used to catch you out of position and start a fight. Play safer whenever his Ultimate R is up.\n\nAvoid standing inside the minion wave. This will allow Varus to poke and push the wave at the same time. Standing outside of the minion wave will force him to choose between shoving and poking with his Q.\n\nVarus will try his hardest to poke you out of lane. Try your hardest of dodge as much damage and abilities as possible. Opt for extra sustain if you can\u2019t dodge skill shots."}
{"text": "As vladimir, You should push the first wave, then pull the second one to the tower, and just freezing there, so Vladimir stays overextended.\n\nAfter level 6, Vladimir gets a power spike with his e, so play a bit more passively against him in that stage.\n\nThe best opportunity to trade with Vladimir is when he has used up his l, since it is his only tool or survivability in his kit, and he can deal damage while using it with his l>E combo, so it makes it even more vital to him.\n\nVladimir is strong at all stages of the game, because he has so much built-in sustain and scales later, but waveclear is the only thing you have that is more powerful than his."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo will place tons of Mushrooms t around objectives and in high traffic areas. Make sure you buy Control Wards and avoid obvious paths around the map.\n\nTeemo is really squishy, so if you can catch him out as he goes to ward, you will increase your chances of winning the fight.\n\nFocus him down first! While Teemo is \u201cSupport\u201d he is still going to be a really strong threat in team fights."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Group up with your teammates when you can and try to get a multi-man knock-up. If you manage to knock up a high-priority target, you should be able to go in and make quick work of them.\n\nGet a defensive item as quickly as you can. This will help a lot when dealing with CC in this game, as CC is your worst enemy can get you killed indefinitely.\n\nIn the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss-positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Kayn is rather good in the early game and will look to invade/gank as frequently as he can so he can get his transformation.\n\nWhen Kayn gets his transformation, he will be much stronger. If he goes Red Kayn, he will be tankier, if he goes Blue Kayn, he will deal tons of damage. \n\nAt level 6, Kayn can be more aggressive and go for riskier plays as he can use his Ultimate R to protect him from dying. Keep this in mind when fighting him."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Improper usage of his W can get him killed in the lane. This is especially true against ranged matchups. The alternative is to back off, which allows the enemy to just zone Yasuo off the wave.\n\nVery vulnerable to crowd control as it prevents him from casting his E for a while. He can\u2019t cast E on the same target twice, so he can easily be caught out.\n\nAlthough a power house, he is very squishy and can easily be burst down if he happens to mis-step. This can happen quite a lot if he is pushing the sidelanes, and overextends."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Fortunately, he will not have this problem at the end of the game and will now remove many enemies with his E. Adding another point to his Ultimate R will give his powers more global strength. It can be practical by taking neutral goals and fighting enemies who rely on diving and lock Heimerdinger down. Heimerdinger will have a lot of articles now, and his abilities can easily a-shot enemies if they are not careful or if Heimerdinger puts a death brush somewhere. He can also take on the Baron alone."}
{"text": "As lux, You are weaker than them every time they have their Ultimate up. If you are in danger of dying, always remember at level 5 so that you are not killed when they have reached level 6. Make sure to adjust your position according to where Lux is standing in the track. They have the advantage of the range and if you are standing too far forward, they will harass you for free. Keep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them after they have used a capacity as they can not use it to trade with. Lux is less of a threat when they have a capacity down."}
{"text": "Against lucian, In team fights, take care that Lucian can use his E to reposition and escape danger. Try and wait for him to use his E before using your CC capabilities so it's harder for him to avoid them. Avoid letting Lucian get a full channel of his Ultimate R on you in a team fight by decommiting or canceling it with CC. Lookout for Lucian positioning. He will often walk forward to land auto attacks. Once he's mispositioned, use this to your advantage to concentrate him down."}

Capitalize on this by looking to fight her when she has no mana available.\n\nSona is incredibly vulnerable in the early game. Before level 6, try to abuse her as much as possible. Once she is level 6, her kill pressure increases as her Ultimate R is a great duelling tool and has great gank set up too. \n\nThe best time to play aggressively is when Sona overextends to get stacks on her Spellthief\u2019s Edge. When she is overextended, try to play aggressive and burst her down when she\u2019s positioned forward. "}
{"text": "As shaco, A maximum-out Ultimate l will confer the benefits of a weaker and greater break-up of the damage of the Shaco clone. It will leave Shaco enemies at one blow if they destroy it while it is nearby. It will do a lot of damage to the enemy team now, especially the squishy targets. It has the potential to a low-shot, still, and squishy targets quickly now. Shaco is pretty decent in team fighting due to its clones and short cooling on its capabilities. It can quickly get rid of critical doors due to its e and set traps for the enemy team using its Ultimate l and x."}
{"text": "As maokai, Maokai is not great in 1v1 scenarios because it lacks damage. It can easily be invaded by early-game junglers. He will be unable to flank or get to the enemy in team fighting if they place the pupils on the side. Even if he is a tank, he can easily die in team fighting when he uses his W on a target. If his team is not there to follow, he will die quickly too. Look at the map before entering."}
{"text": "As ekko, Ekko is an early game strong Jungler. Use this to your advantage by looking to gank as often as you can in the early game. You can start to glove once you have your E and W. While you are a strong Jungler, you need to find a healthy balance between agriculture and ganking. Gold is incredibly important for Ekko and if it falls behind it will find it hard to get back in the game. Ekko has good objective control. Try to guarantee every goal if possible, alone or with your team to get an advance on the enemy."}
{"text": "As alistar, Alistar\u2019s first power spike is once he hits level 2 as he will gain access to the two main CC tools he needs to start skirmishes with the enemy. Hitting level 2 first and unlocking both your W and e is crucial to gaining an early advantage.\n\nAfter Alistar has picked up his Boots, he can start to roam around the map freely. As he has a lot of kill pressure, he should look to roam when opportunities arise. \n\nAt level 6, Alistar can go for riskier plays thanks to the added protection his Ultimate provides him. At this stage of the game, he can look for potential dive opportunities in the bottom or mid lane."}
{"text": "As tristana, His field of attack will be quite high during this phase of the game. He will let her get out of a lot of damage while remaining safe from CC. Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to inflict more damage and strengthen the arrival movement. It will be on a low cooling which means that she can use it quite frequently. This step of the game is made or broken for Trist. It can be strong, but if it is not early, it will be absolutely weak."}
{"text": "As lillia, The first item will give her a massive damage boost in the Jungle. It will make her ganks more potent, especially once she gets her Ultimate R. She will be able to clear the camp pretty quickly as well.\n\nLiliia is an early ganker and should use the lack of vision during the early game to disturb enemies and force them to concede their lanes to her teammates. Looking for pushed-up targets should be relatively easy for her.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant power spike for her. This will enhance her gank and team fight potential, and she will be able to decimate enemies who are clumped together during fights."}
{"text": "As khazix, Kha\u2019Zix is a strong early game Jungler. Look to gank and go for duels frequently with the enemy. Getting an early kill or two will make the game much easier for you.\n\nFocus on securing objectives. As you\u2019re the Jungler after all, make sure you try to take them as often as possible. Your champion is very good at taking them alone. \n\nWhile you\u2019re a strong fighter and good in the early game, you need to ensure you put time away to focus on farming and gaining gold and XP. Secure your camps as often as possible."}
{"text": "Against xayah, Keep a constant eye on her Feathers and avoid standing in front of them. This will reduce her ability to burst you down and trade with her E.\n\nXayah\u2019s rather weak in the early game. Try to abuse her as much as possible to get an early advantage. With low range, she can easily be poked down and harassed.\n\nAvoid committing for extended trades with Xayah unless you have an advantage. Thanks to her E and W, she wins extended trades."}
{"text": "As neeko, An Ultimate R maximum-out will allow Neeko to use the ability quite frequently. All she has to do is find a flank on the enemy team. Her end-of-game team fight is really powerful. She can disrupt an entire team with a well-positioned R or Ultimate R. Her damage during the end of the match is absolutely massive."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Very immobile which can make him a prime target for engage champions. Once engaged upon, he can do nothing unless he gets some help from his teammates.\n\nOnce his e is down, he will be useless unless he has some sort of item or numbers advantage. His e forms the core of his entire kit so if the enemy waits it out, he won\u2019t be as effective.\n\nWhen going for the AD build, his Ultimate y is next to useless in terms of both utility and damage. It also costs a high amount of mana which is really bad for Kog\u2019Maw."}
{"text": "As sejuani, Focus on agriculture and hit level 6 as fast as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your waste potential. Your ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Every time it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get murders. Try to secure goals with your team."}
{"text": "As lulu, Use your k for poke Lulu out of the way. This combined with your e will result in massive damage outputs from your end. Use only your s when the W of Lulu is down. Do not do it will get you killed easily because its W is really boring. If Lulu plays safely, just focus on roaming with your s. The enemies will not expect it and will fall prey to your damage. The wave must be kept in the middle of the track and you should just focus on out of damage."}
{"text": "Against alistar, Alistar will not hesitate to Flasher over the walls to start the fight. Make sure to keep your flanks by sipping a goal or starting the Baron or Dragon. Alistars Ultimate provides him with a ton of additional defensive statistics. In team fights, don't focus it because it will be very difficult for you to kill him. Instead, try to peel and wait for his Ultimate to finish before focusing it down. Avoid grouping very closely like a team and never stand together inside the jungle. Alistars basic t>e combo has a big enough AOE and you can lose the team fight if it can get a multi-person hit up."}
{"text": "As akali, Both your E and Ultimate offer tons of outplay potential. You can often escape ganks or turn them easily if you are able to play slowly and wait for the perfect opportunity to fight or escape. Champions Squishy will often be left alone, or they will walk around the card without help. You can use this to your snowball advantage and get more killers like Akali is a powerful killer and can kill squishy champions easily. If you are able to get some killers in the way, you can make snowball quite quickly and further your lead. Try to abuse any slight advantage you get to increase your chances of winning the game."}
{"text": "Against ekko, When Ekko reaches level 9, his wave signal increases considerably. At that time, he will seek to collect CS sideways and split thrust. Send someone to match him in the sidetrack to prevent him from growing for free and taking turrets. Once Ekko touches level 6, his pressure of death increases and he will seek to go to kill. Respect his everything in potential when his ultimate R is standing as he will use it to escape after a murder. Ekkos greater peak of power is two articles (Protobelt and Lichbane). When he completes these articles, he will become a machine to shoot a blow."}
{"text": "As rell, Group and stay with your team. Go to ward when you know where the enemy is so you do not get picked off and killed before an objective spawns.\n\nLook for picks with your Ultimate R. Rell can quickly force objectives or team fights with ease if she can catch someone who walks too far forward.\n\nPeel and protect your allies as much as possible in mid-game team fights. If you let them die, it\u2019s going to be difficult for your team to win the fight. After engaging, retreat and peel for your ADC."}
{"text": "As nunu, His tankiness is out of bounds during this phase of the game. He can quickly run down enemies and peel for his carries at the same time due to his overall tankiness.\n\nA maxed-out Ultimate R will allow Nunu to dish out a lot of damage in a short time. If he can set up a death brush, he will automatically win the fight.\n\nHis late-game team fighting will be extreme as he is very tanky, and his ability to frontline will make it really easy for his team to succeed in fights."}
{"text": "As malphite, Putting 3 points in his Ultimate h will be the final nail in the coffin of the enemy team. They won't be able to do anything about the low cooldown of his Ultimate h.\n\nMalphite is quite decent in late-game team fights. This is because his Ultimate h will almost always be up, and he can easily use the fog of war to get to his enemies.\n\nHe has a lot of versatility in his kit, which allows him to be an unkillable juggernaut or a glass cannon who excels at one-shooting the enemy. The game state will dictate the optimum path for his team, but it is always better to go for a full AP build when the enemy is filled with squishy and ranged carries."}
{"text": "Against lillia, Lillia isn\u2019t the strongest early game champion. You can use this to your advantage by invading and trying to fight her if you\u2019re a strong early game champion like Hecarim, Lee Sin or Elise.\n\nPost 6, fighting Lillia is going to be harder as her Ultimate R can put you to sleep. Unless you can kill her quickly, it will be difficult to win a fight against her unless you\u2019re ahead.\n\nVision will make ganking harder for Lillia, especially post 6. Placing vision around her jungle entrances and in the river will make it very hard for her to find successful ganks."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Constantly keep an eye on your champions position as well as his. If you keep your eye off the ball for 1 second, Cho\u2019Gath may end up hitting you with his e or m.\n\nCho\u2019Gath has a lot of sustain thanks to his Passive which restores health. Look to trade frequently or he will out sustain any damage you deal to him.\n\nCho\u2019Gath will get lots of sustain through his Passive and the items he buys. Try to match his sustain by starting with Corrupting Potion and buy items like Morello or Executioner\u2019s Calling to reduce his sustain."}
{"text": "As nasus, It's important to keep stacking your Q otherwise you'll fall behind. Turn around the map and help your teammates if you need to. But, don't commit too much to help them, especially if you can secure goals. Pull the pressure while your team tries to seat goals elsewhere to open the map."}
{"text": "As udyr, Udyr will begin to fall as the game continues, so he should focus on getting an early lead and then finish the game by taking goals and fixing enemy spinners behind. As usual, his Ultimate e will not give him a massive peak at level 16 because it does not make any significant difference for Udyr. This will only allow him to reduce his targets quickly. Udyr will become really tanky during this stage of the game. Combined with his speed of movement, he will have an effortless time to avoid the important shots skills and CC'ing targets on the enemy team."}
{"text": "As chogath, After Cho\u2019Gath has put multiple points in his s, he will be able to trade more effectively with the enemy. Combined with some of his other power spikes we will discuss, he can start to out-trade many enemy champions.\n\nCho\u2019Gath cannot trade too well until after his first back. When he picks up his first component item, trading becomes much easier for him as his damage and survivability increases. \n\nAt level 6, Cho\u2019Gath\u2019s kill pressure intensifies as he can execute an enemy champion if they overextend. Even if he cannot kill them, he can still put his Ultimate t to good use."}
{"text": "As gragas, His potential for engagement and locking is really high due to his E and Q. Once he unlocks his Ultimate R, he can move the enemy champions to disadvantageous positions and have them killed instantly. If he goes full AP, his burst damage is unreal, especially when he fights 1 v 1 against someone from squishier. His W still provides him with enough tankness to not get blown up immediately."}
{"text": "As malphite, Do not fight in the late game unless your **Ultimate** is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss out on the potential knockup it provides.\n\nYour **Ultimate** will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "Against tristana, Her E and Q makes taking down turrets a piece of cake. Avoid letting her get free shots on your turret since the tower platings will give her a gold advantage over you.\n\nAvoid extended trades with Tristana whenever her E is on you. The more auto-attacks she hits you with- the more damage you will take. \n\nTristana will often use her W aggressively. If you\u2019re strong and have good all-in, you could try to trade back with her and use her mispositioning to kill her. Take a quick glance at the minimap to see if her Jungler is nearby before committing to the fight though."}
{"text": "As ryze, Ryze is excellent during the late game as he can completely take over the game with his overall burst damage combo and his Passive. All he needs to do is be a part of significant fights.\n\nLevel sixteen is a decent spike when it comes to macro-based plays. He can quickly jump from one objective to another, which can easily lead to wins for him.\n\nHis damage output will be really high during the later parts of the game. This will kill most of his enemies if they happen to get CC'd by Ryze."}
{"text": "Against varus, Varus has a good selection potential with his Ultimate R. Avoiding too extensive or being within reach of him when he was sitting in the middle track as he might be looking to start the fight. Choosing Varus before a team fight is very effective. Bursting is one of the best ways to do it because he is rather squishy and still because of the lack of a dash or ability to escape. Varus will try to delay a team fight as long as possible while harassing with his Qs and Es."}
{"text": "As diana, Flank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nDo not fight unless your Ultimate R and Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass is up in the late game. If you look to fight when it\u2019s down, you will be an easy target and die quite fast.\n\nIf you\u2019re ahead, look for picks or ambush the enemy as they walk through their jungle. Taking one enemy down could be enough to win the next fight or take the Baron."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim's ability to inflict damage will skyrocket during this phase of the game. It will also be quite tanky due to his articles and statistics, which means that it will be a consistent DPS power. Once he gets 3 points in his Ultimate t, no enemy backline will be safe anymore. So Hecarim should use the fog of the war and sit on the upper side of the enemy Jungle and wait to kill any wandering enemy champion. Once his h and W will come out, he will almost be unable to kill while he is mobile and manages to stick to his target. CC is his worst enemy, so some tenacity will help him a lot."}
{"text": "Against galio, Depending on the synergy of the CDA, Galio can cling to level 2 or 3 if his ADC is an aggressive and dominant champion from the beginning of the game. Try and stay within the maximum range at any time to make it very difficult for Galio to use his E and W aggressively to tease you. He is much stronger and has good gank set up when he is healthy and these two abilities are on the rise. Galio , the biggest peak of power is reached at level 6. His R gives a great opportunity of gank and to help other lines or run in a team fight. However, he does not have much to kill threat against enemy travelers in a 1v1 at level 6."}
{"text": "As zoe, After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nTry and siege objectives with your team during the mid-game.

{"text": "As seraphine, Your Q will hit like a truck now, and your W will allow you to heal many allies at the same time. Overall, you will be helping your team out a lot during fights.\n\nSince your Ultimate R will be on a short cooldown, use it as much as you can, and do not fight without it. Otherwise, you will lack a lot of damage and CC to kill enemies.\n\nNeutral Objective fights should be your bread and butter. The fights are pretty congested, and you can easily afflict multiple targets. Just try your best to not get killed, as assassins will definitely try to dive you."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius starts to fall off in the late game, but he is still powerful. He falls off as other champions start getting items that counter him, and many champions will be tankier, which makes it harder for him to kill them.\n\nAt level 16, Darius\u2019s Ultimate e will be an essential tool in team fights. As it can deal a considerable amount of damage and as it is an execute- he will be able to take down targets and use the reset to kill multiple targets.\n\nBy this stage of the game, Darius should be near max build. As he builds items that enhance his damage and offer him protection, he will be relatively tanky and challenging to take down."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Use your Q & E to target both enemies and minions simultaneously to use your mana effectively. Do not spam these capabilities either, as you will lack mana quickly. Once you get your first component, you should be able to spam capabilities much more frequently. Now you can look for aggressive trades with your Q & E. Getting your Ultimate R will be a big turn in the game. You can use it sololy, but the best use will be during intertwined fighting."}
{"text": "As pantheon, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make it easier to access the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}

This means that he can use the ability frequently, which will make him quite powerful in team fights. \n \nAt level thirteen, Taric will have two of his abilities maxed out.

It will easily get you a kill or two.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower for as long as possible. It will make his life hell in this matchup."}
{"text": "As ivern, Ivern can easily choose his enemies with his Q. This is best done when Ivern manages to catch an unsuspecting enemy with his Q of war fog. Once Ivern gets his Ultimate R, he can easily distract critical members of the enemy team, instigate the divers turn, peel for his wears, and take neutral goals all at once. This will give him a lot of power. Ivern is really good in the fights during this stage as it will be complete and will act as a secondary support for the team. Allied ports will feel very safe around Ivern."}

Fighting around chokepoints should be very fruitful for you.\n\nSetting up death brushes will be a pretty viable strategy during this phase of the game as well.

Using the lane brushes to land free poke on her enemy laner will allow her to assert dominance in this lane.\n\nSince Karma has her Ultimate a from the beginning, she won't be spiking too hard at 6. To compensate, Karma will have to play the early laning phase aggressively to completely dismantle the enemy bot lane.\n\nThe first item component will increase her poke damage and her mana (using a regeneration or pure mana pool).

Against unsuspecting enemies, this skill can be really deadly, and can help him secure kills quite easily.\n\nCan flank the enemy team with relative ease and can get out of sticky situations with his E.

This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently."}
{"text": "Against zoe, Zoe will be looking for choices at the beginning of the team fight with her E. Try to stay as far as possible and away from her to reduce her chances of getting you to bed. She will be looking to delay a team fight while she tries to bring you down with her Q and get choices with her E. Fortifying a fight and not letting her lower you will make the team fight much easier. Sieging Tours will be difficult when Zoe is alive because she has a good clear wave."}
{"text": "As morgana, Concentrate them with your other front-line champions and Ultimate R. Make sure you're still on the side of the map that the next major goal is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free. As you are the Jungler, you need to make sure you're still alive in the late game. If you die before a major spawning goal, the enemy will be able to take it."}
{"text": "As jhin, Once Jhin gets two points in his Ultimate R, he will secure picks with ease and help his team catch up to enemies. The damage will also be increased.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let him clear minions waves with ease, and the damage dealt to champions will be really high.\n\nJhin's damage ability will be really high during the mid-game. He can blow up squishies with his abilities and 4th shot. He will just have to ensure that he can kite around tanks.        "}
{"text": "As rell, You will not be able to engage at all if the enemy has blows or interruptions in the way. To work around it, either look to wander or use your t of an unrewarded bush to engage. Rell is very motionless when it is disassembled. This makes her incredibly vulnerable when it is disassembled t. If you are behind, it will be impossible for you to get a good R Ultimate or t off because you will be too squishy and die as soon as you enter."}
{"text": "Against xayah, Once it is level 6, Xayah will have additional protection in the way that its Ultimate R can help its dodge damage. At this point, it will be a little harder for you to kill it whenever its Ultimate R is in place. The more the game goes, the stronger Xayah will become. Try to put it behind in the early game so that it is not as useful in the middle and end of the game. When Xayah gets 2 finished elements, its death pressure and the release of damage will be very high. At this point, it would be advisable not to fight it unless you have a significant advantage in damages or numbers."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 1 is a decent point for Pantheon, provided it succeeds in using the track brushes correctly. Depending on the ability, it can either poke enemies or go for an all-in. Level 6 is not too good because it will not help him in the way as much. That being said, it can wander and take reminders frequently. Boots are a massive peak to its roaming ability in the game. It should seek to make games all around the card."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Hitting level 3 will be quite difficult so make sure to avoid conflicts and use your Q to heal regularly. This will allow you to soon become gank-worthy. Focus on getting your basic elements as quickly as you can. You are highly dependent on them and will be able to execute enemies down if you manage to get a quick advance."}
{"text": "As quinn, While she doesn't have a Ultimate R combat, her Ultimate R is an excellent roaming tool that can allow her to return to the line quickly and also wander around the map and help her allies. She can blow up enemies who are alone when she is in front. Look for spikes on squissy and still targets to get a lead further."}
{"text": "As masteryi, 2 points in his Ultimate r will make him more potent during fights. He will have to flank enemies and ensure that all the CC from the enemy teams' side is used up.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9, allowing him to deal hefty amounts of damage in a very brief period.\n\nHe is pretty decent during team fights. He can completely decimate the enemy team if he manages to get a e reset off with his Ultimate r activated.        "}
{"text": "As yasuo, Very strong when the enemy is pushed up and a new minion wave is approaching. This allows him to use his E to catch up to his enemy laner and then knock them up with his r. Yasuo can quite easily set up ganks with this tactic as well.\n\nPlaying around the W can allow him to completely dismantle ranged enemy matchups. He can run around the windwall and save himself from a lot of damage this way. Agaisnt melee champions, it is always wise to back off and maintain some distance from them.\n\nPost-six, he becomes extremely strong due to his Ultimate R crowd control as well the bonus armor penetration he gets upon using it. Combined with his item powerspikes, it makes him a force to be reckoned with, even if he is behind in lane."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Always adjust your position in the track so Ornn is unable to crush you with his E. Get away from the walls and his Pillar Q so he is unable to CC. Refuse to use major CC capabilities on Ornn when his W is out of cooling as he can use it to avoid or escape CC. Once Ornn reaches level 6, his death pressure in the track will increase and he can start getting ganks from his Jungler. Get a vision in the river so you can spot the Jungler early."}
{"text": "Against brand, Brand is really strong at level 2 and 3 when he gets access to more abilities. Be prepared to back off slightly when he gets the level up so you don\u2019t risk losing your health bar.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Brand gets thanks to the items he\u2019ll get. Try to set him behind in the early game to reduce his gold income and prevent a snowball.\n\nOnce Brand hits level 6, his damage output and ability to kill you will be much higher thanks to his Ultimate R. If you are low, make sure you recall as he can easily burst you down and kill you."}
{"text": "Against blitzcrank, If Blitzcrank ever misses his b in a team fight, make sure you focus and kill him while he's out of position. He's pretty vulnerable to the CC and if you can lock him up, he's an easy target. Blitzcrank is rather squishy and still. Grab him out of position and ambuzz him when he goes alone to guard goals like the Baron or Dragon. If Blitzcrank is nowhere to be seen, he could be on your team's side and try to get a good hook b. Make sure you have the vision near you when sitting goals."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Aatrox loses the burst trades, but he will win the extended due to the multiple Q  knock-ups and his Passive Deathbringer Stance's heal. Keeping range with your Q and Umbral Dash can allow you to deal damage while preventing his engage.\n\nPantheon has very hard power-spikes at levels one through three. Be careful and watch which minions have died and play safe until you have your abilities to fight back.\n\nKeep an eye on Pantheon's empowered ability charges, when he has all 5, his next ability is heavily empowered.\n\nPantheon's ultimate allows him to join far away fights quickly. Shoving in his wave and roaming before he does can give your team the advantage in the fight and turn it in your favor before Pantheon arrives."}
{"text": "As akali, At this point, your knowledge of the map should be at its peak. You should always try to push the wave with your Q and try to go towards any path that has an extended laner. This will allow you to use your E and Ultimate to catch up with such wide targets, and get rid of them quickly. When you fight for a neutral goal and you manage to land an E on an enemy champion, you do not need to always go-in. That's because your presence, and the threat of your E, W and R that automatically keeps the enemy away from you. This will eventually allow the enemy team to be zoned. The correct use of your W is very important during this stage of the game. If used freely, the enemy laner can drag you into such an all-in and then get rid of Akali quickly."}
{"text": "As hwei, At level 6, you should look for fights with your Jungler in the middle or side lanes. Play safe until you are level 3, where you have access to your primary abilities and can fight much more favorably."}
{"text": "As kayn, Once Kayn gets 2 points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to all enemies much more frequently. He will be perfect as he will also get his form. His Q will be maximized to level 9. This is really useful for him because it is his primary damage ability. It will allow him to flatten a lot of damage and kill squishies and tanks (depending on his form). During the middle of the game, he should be able to get multiple shots in the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against karma, Force a team fight as quickly as you can so Karma isn\u2019t able to poke your team down before you have the chance to engage. Delaying a team fight will allow her to harass your team and make the fight much riskier. \n\nIf Karma uses her empowered Q when trying to poke, you should use the cooldown to start a team fight. When Karma\u2019s Ultimate a is down, she cannot give her team a huge shield d which will make fighting much easier.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to invest in an Executioner\u2019s Calling. It will reduce her healing and shielding and it will make winning the team fight a lot easier."}

{"text": "As lulu, Her last game is phenomenal since she can peel for her team for days. No one can get close to her team as long as her W and Ultimate R are in place. Lulu's Ultimate R at level 16 is a strength to count with. It will be difficult for the enemy team to eliminate Lulu's team due to the short cooling period of the ability, and killing Lulu will really be next to impossible. Lulu will be fully built by then in the game. Her shielding potential will be out of the world, and she can allow her entire team if she manages to use her abilities properly."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie is excellent in team fights thanks to the great AOE on her Ultimate R. When she is paired with her passive trick, she will be able to darken several champions if they are grouped. Annie is really good at popping up and ambushing squishy, low-health enemy champions. Getting some murders on Annie can make her Ultimate R incredibly scary. Look to choose low-health targets for easy murders. She's really good to force the enemy Support to play safely and avoid overextending if she cares about her trick for a period of time."}
{"text": "Against akshan, He could drive your team in danger or an ambush. Try to look for fights when Akshan is not there. This way, he won't be able to benefit from his W. Playing around Akshans Ultimate will be very beneficial during the middle of the game. Otherwise, he will be unable to maximize his release of damage."}
{"text": "As yone, Make sure you're close to your team at all times so you can fight quickly. After your bot track has moved to the medium track, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to close and win XP.

After killing someone, make the call for a nearby goal."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Whenever he has 3 Towers Q up, he is always going to be a threat.\n \nAt level 6, when Heimerdinger unlocks his Ultimate R, he basically gets 3 new abilities. Take care when trying to fight him as he might just use any one of his abilities to trade with you.\n \nLevel 3, 6, 11, & 16 are Heimerdinger\u2019s major level spikes. Take care when he reaches those spikes as he may look to all-in you."}
{"text": "Against teemo, As Teemo is a ranged champion, expect him to try and harass you as much as possible. Investing in defensive starting items could be a good way of dealing with him from the get-go.\n\nTeemo will place Shrooms t around the edges of the lane. Avoid walking to the side of the lane and only walk the path your minions take to reduce your damage taken.\n\nBe prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP and health. Teemo has a lot of kill pressure if he takes Ignite and is able to harass and poke you down."}
{"text": "As skarner, During the mid-game, look to split push and apply pressure around the map. You can use your E to escape collapsing enemies.\n\nLook to flank in team fights with your E and Ultimate. Lockdown key targets who have overextended or mispositioned.\n\nAlternatively, group with your team and fight the enemy in the jungle or around objectives. Somewhere where they will be grouped together so you can lock down multiple targets with your Ultimate.\n"}
{"text": "As kayle, Continue to rob Kayle with your e, silence her, and step back as quickly as you can. You want to integrate her quite often early. Once you get your Ultimate t, you will be able to decimate Kayle. Make sure her Ultimate -R- is down though. During team fighting, make sure you can target the enemy rearline. Using the war fog should help. Keep the wave near your turn. It will allow you to expose Kayle to ganks and get murders on her regularly."}
{"text": "As ekko, His W allows him to engage in an enemy group or champions, or a single enemy champion with ease. It's really beneficial if he can land him out of the sight and then use his E to get high in the W circle to ensure stunning. His brilliant damage must not be ignored as the game continues. This is especially true when he is ahead of the game. He can literally pull the enemy out of the rear line in a spin of spells, if he reaches W E on them. His Ultimate R is the most powerful ability in his kit because it allows him to undo his mistakes, especially when he chooses a bad fight or fails an all-in-one."}
{"text": "As nasus, You will have to hinder his farming as much as you can in this matchup, else he will prove to be a monster who will be very hard to deal with in the late game.\n\nYour mobility is your mainstay in this matchup. Use it to counter Nasus, but be very careful about his slow.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate, you may want to look for ganks all around the map. It should be quite easy to pull off given how your ult works, but make sure you push Nasus out of the lane before roaming.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As alistar, In the late game, Alistar will be incredibly tanky as he would\u2019ve picked up multiple defensive items that will help keep him and his team alive.\n\nAt level 16, Alistar will have put 3 points in his Ultimate. With the insane damage reduction this ability offers him, he should be able to survive all team fights for a long period of time.\n\nTeams will be grouping together in the late parts of the game. This is good for Alistar as he will still be able to get a multi-person knock-up with his t>e combo."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Do not try to execute Wukong if he still has his y available. This is because you may waste your execution on him and he will survive. Keep this in mind when trading too!\n\nWukong wins a lot of auto-attack battles, so don\u2019t go for extended trades with him unless you can kill him.\n\nIf Wukong has left lane after level 6, tell your team as soon as he leaves. He might be trying to use his Ultimate n in a different lane too help his allies."}
{"text": "As gnar, Gnar's level 6 is a massive power spike for him as he can completely dismantle an enemy team with a well-timed Ultimate R. He will also be instrumental when it comes to flanking the enemy team during significant fights.\n\nHis first item component will give him a decent damage boost. He is already quite obnoxious due to his Q and W. Still, the component will now let him make the enemy recall abruptly quite often.\n\nGnar is relatively weaker early on because he doesn't have his Ultimate R available. As a result, he can't dish out a lot of damage. To compensate for this, he will want to use the lane brushes and his range advantage to keep poking the enemy champion while using his E as a measure to maintain the spacing between his enemy and him."}
{"text": "As sylas, Concentrate them with your other front-line champions. As you are the Jungler, you must make sure that you are still alive in the late match. If you will die before a major goal scares, the enemy will be able to take it. Make sure that you are still on the side of the map that the next major goal is safe. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free."}
{"text": "Against swain, At level 6, Swain\u2019s damage output and survivability increases. You shouldn\u2019t commit to a fight with him unless you can burst him down quickly as his Ultimate R will offer him extra protection and health regeneration.\n\nSwain\u2019s early game is abusable as he is really weak early on. Once the mid-game hits, you\u2019ll have to play more respectable.\n\nHe is really good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Bursting him down at the start of the fight will make it difficult for him to deal damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "Against brand, Avoid fighting in tight neighborhoods like inside the jungle or around a goal. This will make its Ultimate R much less powerful. With that said, when the group tries not to get too grouped together so that it can't bounce its Ultimate R between several champions either. Brand will try to inflict a lot of damage and delay a team fight as long as possible while poking down. To prevent it from destroying your health bar, you have to fight it as soon as you see it. Don't try to take goals like the Dragon or Baron when Brand is alive because he can use his Ultimate R to inflict a lot of brilliant damage."}

Avoid walking in areas where you know Sion has been so its harder for you to get caught out by him.\n\nKite and disengage is Sion\u2019s biggest threat in a team fight. Try to keep him away from your team so he is unable to get a good Q knockup.\n\nAvoid grouping and fighting in the jungle as it will allow Sion to either get a really good knockup with his Q or get a really good Ultimate R off. Group together, but do not stand on top of one another so he is unable to get a multi-person knockup. "}
{"text": "As gangplank, Gangplank early game is quite weak. Focusing on agriculture and winning as much gold as possible to get your key elements quickly. Watch the card at any time after level 6. Your ultimate R is very impacted and can help your allies win fights and skirmishes. Avoid fighting in the game early if possible. Gangplank needs time to come online and in some matchesups you will need to focus on agriculture and survive."}
{"text": "As karthus, Your level 2 is much stronger than the enemies. Try to get level 2 first (the first wave followed by 1 melee minion) then look for a whole in it. Make sure to hit 2 first to win the exchange. The enemy will use their capabilities on the minion wave to push. Try to stand outside the minion wave but close to it so they have to choose between pushing and poking. Keep an eye on your mana at all times, especially at level 2 and level 3 all in it. If you miss mana, you have no way to come back with the enemy and you will be very vulnerable. All enemies in potential is incredibly strong, try to stay as healthy as possible and retreat if you are low. If the enemy gets luck - they will look for everything in it and if you fall behind, you will find it hard to return."}
{"text": "As kennen, Level 6 is really strong for Kennen as he gets access to an AoE CC ability which can quickly turn the tide of a fight. Kennen should try to flank enemies for maximal effectiveness.\n\nHis first item component will increase his damage significantly. Kennen is obnoxious for his poke damage, and the item will only enhance it.\n\nKennen isn't very strong early on as he solely relies on AP to maximize his poke damage. He will want to use the lane brushes to catch the enemy off-guard when possible."}
{"text": "As olaf, Focus on the backline and try to get them out of the fight. Focus on your other front line champions. As a top laner, you need to make sure you don't give up your team during all the ins and leave them behind. Remember that you're immune to CC due to your Ultimate k and not your team. Make sure you're still on the side of the map that the next main goal is safe. This will allow you to work with your Jungler to secure the choices and negate vision around this area. If you get a choice on the Jungler enemy, your team should easily win the game."}
{"text": "As swain, Invest in healing reduction. It will reduce his sustainability.\n\nStand as far back as possible so he cannot land or use his Q on you.\n\nAim your abilities so they push and poke you at the same time.\n\nAt level 6, it can be hard to kill Swain. Only look for the all-in if your Jungler is nearby and ready to help."}
{"text": "As kled, If he gets dismounted and the enemy disengages, he will have a hard time getting Skaarl back. If Kled is against a ranged matchup, he won\u2019t be able to even farm safely while being dismounted.\n\nMissing his E will make it really easy for the enemy ranged carries to kite him out. If he goes in with his W on cooldown, he won\u2019t be as effective as he should be in an all-in.\n\nIf he uses his Ultimate R and the enemy manages to cut his team off of him, then he won\u2019t have any form of follow up and his team will have lost their frontline. It will cause a lot of mayhem and may cause a team fight loss."}
{"text": "As viego, You can use your Ultimate R as an escape tool in heavily bottled fighting. This is not recommended because the ability can allow you to turn a fight and save yourself almost immediately. Your E will be pivot to fight during this phase of the game. Always try to flank the enemy and get dead on the back line. In this way you will be able to take the game easily."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Once Aatrox reaches level 9, its Q will be maximized. The reduction of cooling time and additional precipitation will mean that this capacity is on a very short cooling time. During the middle of the game, Aatrox will have brought elements that will reduce its cooling capabilities. Through levels 9-13, its capabilities will be on a very short cooling time. When Aatrox touches level 11 and puts two points in its Ultimate R, it will be a serious threat to the enemy in team fighting. Fight around your Ultimate to do a ton of damage and survive team fighting."}
{"text": "As jhin, His immobility is his main weakness as he has a large target painted on his head because of this. If the enemy manages to catch him out, he will die.\n\nDue to his Passive, he isn\u2019t really good against tanks, especially the ones who can get on his face. It will take ages for him to get rid of a genuine tank.\n\nThe Ultimate R roots him in place. This allows the enemy to both flank and focus him down with ease. Due to his squishiness, he can\u2019t really survive for too long."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas gets to level 16, he will have his Ultimate R maxed out. It will give him a massive damage boost, and the low cooldown combined with the knockback will help him pick high-priority targets.\n\nGragas will either be extraordinarily tanky or a glass cannon dependent on landing his combo depending on the build. As a mid laner, Gragas will mostly be the latter, so his main goal will be to blow up the enemy backline when he gets the chance.\n\nHis dash and Ultimate R make up for a tremendous amount of peel for his carries. Should he go for the tank build route, he will successfully absorb much damage for his team while his team follows up on Gragas' engagement."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia\u2019s Ultimate R is a great tool in team fights. Hitting 5 champions at once is a sure-fire way of winning the team fight.\n\nShe deals a lot of damage in extended trades as long as she lands her Q. She needs to make sure she keeps an eye on her mana pool though so she doesn\u2019t run out of mana.\n\nCassiopeia can often get early kills in lane with a level 2 all-in. Getting an early kill will make the laning phase much easier for her."}

{"text": "As chogath, You will need to get your level 3 quickly in order to ask for a hard leash early and quickly reach that level. Once this happens, you can start to glove with your e. See if you can ambushed the enemy Jungler near the Scuttle Crab using the track brushes to hide and then e'ing. Getting neutral goals will be very important, especially once you get your Ultimate t. Focus on the bot track and get them to help you regularly."}
{"text": "As akshan, The early game should be mainly focused on taking short trades against the enemy with your automatic and passive attacks. Do not go for a prolonged trade unless the primary ability of the enemy is on the cooldown. If you succeed in pushing the wave in, try to ride with your W. If it happens that the side travellers enemies are low, you can quickly E in and get some killed. Your Ultimate will help you a lot in this game, but make sure you position properly. Remember that you can use the ability while you are E'ing, so make sure you don't stay still while it is locked."}
{"text": "As shen, Capable of mitigating any form of self-attack damage with his W. This can cause enemy physical damage to be practically useless when this ability is active. He can really put good cheese brushes as well as full opportunities with his E. When combined with some articles, Shen can put extra debuffs on the teased champions with ease. His ultimate R can allow him to act as a goalkeeper for his teammates. This becomes really beneficial if one of Shen=s' teammates is fed and needs to be peeled for."}
{"text": "As yorick, Once his girl Ultimate R is killed, he loses a lot of DPS sustained in a team fight. Choosing the girl before a fight won her will not let him cut down a lot of damage for you. In the way, Yorick will use his Q balls to get her the advantage of pushing, as well as the advantage of poke in the way. Killing these gules first will take a lot of damage from Yorick. Using clear wave capabilities against Yorick will put a period at his push power. After his movements on the map will give you the opportunity to always counter his attempts at split thrusts."}
{"text": "As leblanc, If you are able to shoot down the enemy Mid, ADC or Support, you can use their death timer to finish the game or take a major goal. Group with your team in the end of the game. Do not push them or leave them alone when the enemy is grouped as 5. If your team engages, they will lose the fight."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Falls off during the late game. If he can\u2019t one-shot the person he is targeting, he will be crowd controlled almost immediately and killed on the spot.\n\nIncredibly vulnerable once his Ultimate R is on cooldown. The enemy team should be looking to fight him during this time and target him before anyone else.\n\nIsn\u2019t very effective against a group of champions as he is extremely reliant on picks to get a lead. Besides, crowd controlling him can allow the enemy team to get rid of him quite easily."}
{"text": "As karthus, You will be able to blow up the squishes with your Ultimate e with ease now. Even if they do not die, they will be too big to participate in a team fight. You will be able to burn through the entire enemy team with an appropriate positioning. Your 1 combined with your n will be able to shoot enemy squishes. Use this strategy during neutral and objective battles. Remember that your placement can make or break an entire team. Place it well and fog of war so that the enemy team does not anticipate it and take the necessary precautions in advance."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn doesn\u2019t have a duelling Ultimate R. This makes her weak post level 6 when it comes to all-ins.\n\nShe cannot fight straight 5v5. She will need to flank in team fights. If the enemy has vision or knows where she is, she will be unable to team fight properly and will be forced to split push.\n\nYou are a champion that is prone to all-in and CC. Mix that with the fact that Quinn is quite squishy, it can be challenging to deal with enemy teams that have a lot of CC."}
{"text": "As nocturne, After going in with your Ultimate a, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate a in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate a is up. Fighting with out it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar has a great potential of choice with his Ultimate R. Picking a champion could win you the game! Malzahar has a shield that will protect him from incoming damage.

At level 11, Diana will put the second point in her Ultimate R. It will be on a lower cooling that will allow her to go for the more aggressive all-in. With the lower cooling comes additional damage. She will do a lot of brilliant damage in the middle of the game if she is ahead. Since Diana is a murderer, she will be able to choose targets in the middle of the game that walk on the map alone. In particular, she can ambushed the enemy Support as they try to protect the upcoming goals."}

Gangplank needs time to come online and in some matchesups you will need to focus on agriculture and survive."}
{"text": "As veigar, Very motionless and is extremely vulnerable to crowd control. It has a weak early game as well, so it can easily be abused and killed with some ganks. Its n is on a really long cooldown, and it's its only form of self-peel. Once it's down, it can easily be all-in-a-d and killed with crowd control. It will take a lot of time to come online if it gets killed a few times during the early game. It's not going to be very effective if the game continues for too long so try to close it early and finish the game quickly."}
{"text": "As zilean, Pre-six he is quite squishy, and easily killable if his p is on cooldown. Therefore, any champion who can catch up to him by dashing or blinking will be able to kill him.\n\nHis Q is quite telegraphed and he can be easily punished once his Q is down. Again, his Q can also be dodge by blinking/dashing away from the drop point of his Q.\n\nHe is pretty much a poke/damage bot when his Ultimate t is down. Zilean is inherently squishy so it should not be an issue to take him down once his Ultimate t is on cooldown."}
{"text": "Against nocturne, In the middle of the game, avoid separating yourself by staying in the team. Nocturne has great selection potential and will try to kill squishy champions who are on their own thanks to his Ultimate a. Every time Nocturne is divided by pushing across the map, he has no way to get to his team quickly. If you see it elsewhere, look to engage and start a team fight. Nocturne will try to reduce the most squischi high priority target at the beginning of the fight. It's usually the Mid or ADC. Clump together in team fights to reduce its potential at once."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan has an incredibly strong level 2. This allows him to get cheesy ganks off in either the mid or bot lane once he\u2019s unlocked both his d and e.\n\nHe is pretty mobile and is able to escape a lot of trades. He can also use his mobility to get over walls and dodge commonly placed wards.\n\nHe can repeatedly gank lanes over and over thanks to his relatively low cooldowns. Also, once he is level 6, he can gank overextended or immobile lanes with his Ultimate m which will usually result in a kill for him or his ally. "}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 6, Ezreal will unlock his Ultimate R. His Ultimate R is a great tool throughout all stages of the game. It allows him to deal a considerable amount of damage to anyone on the map.\n\nAfter Ezreal\u2019s first back, he will pick up his first component item. His damage output will intensify and he can look for more aggressive plays once he has it.\n\nWhen Ezreal completes his Mythic item, his damage output further grows. A good Ezreal will look to poke the enemy down with his Q before initiating an all-in."}

If you can land poke while also pushing the minion wave, you could look for a favorable trade.\n\nWhile sieging Baron or Dragon, or whenever you\u2019re pushing the enemy under their tower, look for a pick with your abilities.

Alternatively, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the map and use it to get to your team."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Kayle is at her weakest in the game early. Try to abuse her weakness by playing aggressively and getting murders. Putting her behind in the game early will reduce her ability to continue later in the game. Keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the card will force Kayle to extend for the farm. Once she goes up and tries to hit the last time, you can play aggressive and try the all-in. Once Kayle hits Level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, she will also become varied and she will find it easier to hit the last time."}
{"text": "Against annie, Whenever Annie has her stun available, you need to respect her and play slightly safer. If you\u2019re melee, stand back and wait for her to consume it before walking forward. Post level 6, respect Tibbers R and her stun.\n\nPay attention to the number of stacks on her Passive. You can trade with Annie before she gets 2 stacks without the fear of getting stunned. \n\nAnnie is prone to poke even though her E offers her some protection in trades. Try to poke her down with your abilities before committing to the all-in."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Once you\u2019ve destroyed the tower, move to another lane and try to take that objective too.\n\nTry to harass and poke the enemy as often as you can with your Q.

Getting it stacked in the mid-game is crucial.\n\nMake sure you continue farming and moving around the map picking up objectives."}
{"text": "As camille, At level 16, you would have put the third point in its Ultimate. Its cooldown Ultimates will be a little lower at that time, so you have to play around it as much as possible.

You will be stronger as the game goes."}

{"text": "As kennen, Once Kennen has several objects, he will be able to turn the tide of the game on his own. His poke damage will be enough for two shots of squishy door. When his Ultimate m will be maximized, he will crush a truck loaded with damage. Now Kennen will simply have to rely on the sides and fog of the war to set up a good fight. Late game team fights are often decided in neutral objective pits while taking a goal. Kennen Ultimate m will come very practical during this stage and will allow him to win the match of his team."}
{"text": "As brand, Once Brand hits level 3, he can technically start ganking his allies. But, he needs to make sure he can land his Q otherwise, practically every gank will fail.\n\nAt level 6, Brand will unlock his Ultimate R. At this stage of the game, even if he cannot land his Q when ganking, he can still deal a ton of damage thanks to his Ultimate R alone.\n\nAfter Brand has completed his Mythic item, he will become a real threat. Ganks will be much easier and he will be able to dish out a lot of damage in a short period of time."}
{"text": "As swain, Excellent CC channel if he or someone else on his team gets to CC a target. This works especially well against motionless door. You can follow with your E (press it twice) and shoot the enemy closer. Can regenerate a lot of health with his W and thus surpass his enemies in the way. His ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective in fighting in closed spaces. He can use his W to set up ganks for his Jungler too. This allows him to catch up with his target while providing a vision of the area. The last part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "As malphite, Your Ultimate h will be on an extremely short cooldown now. Use the fog of war to get picks on the enemy and kill them quickly.\n\nOnce you're done all-in'ing the enemy, make sure that you go back to your carries and protect them. This will otherwise result in your ADC dying due to assassins.\n\nNeutral objective fights will be your bread and butter in this game. Always use the fog of war to get a multi-man knockup to ensure that your team can win the game."}
{"text": "As alistar, Once you unlock your capabilities, you should be on the lookout for the entire enemy whenever they stretch beyond their safe area. If enemy travelers play safely, you should move around and see if you can play games elsewhere. Roaming becomes a mandatory thing when you get your boots because Alistar roams are very powerful. During a whole, always make sure you e e the most important / mobile target when possible. Always try to call your Jungler before crashing a huge wave in the enemy tower that you can set up a diving tower with your Ultimate."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Once Caitlyn has a few points in her Q, she can constantly keep the enemy pushed into her tower as her Q offers her a lot of wave clear. When paired with a poke Support, the enemy should never be able to leave their tower. This will result in a huge gold lead too, due to the tower plates.\n\nAfter Cait\u2019s first back, she will pick up her first component item. This will increase her poke and trading potential in lane. It will also make her a huge threat if she has a better first item than the enemy ADC.\n\nCaitlyn\u2019s level 6 is pretty good, but she doesn\u2019t have a combat Ultimate R. This means she can\u2019t use her Ultimate R during a skirmish. However, it is an execute and can be used when she is in a safe position and not in immediate danger."}
{"text": "Against vex, Look out for Vex\u2019s Ultimate R as she can use it to pick enemies off. She can also use it again if the marked target dies.\n\nTry and split up slightly so Vex cannot deal lots of AOE damage with her Q and E.\n\nBaiting out Vex\u2019s W with poke before initiating a fight could be very beneficial as she will miss out on the shield to protect herself with. Her damage output will also be reduced too."}
{"text": "As nunu, Nunu's early game is quite strong as he can gank enemies frequently while staying relatively healthy due to his Q.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive spike as it allows Nunu's ganks to be more effective. He will also be a better team fighter and deal tons of damage.\n\nHis objective control prowess is next to none. One can be sure that a good Nunu player will never lose any objective fight in the game."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in his Ultimate R. As long as he can get the channel off, he will be very good in the late game.\n\nTeams will continue to group in the late game. This will allow Fiddlesticks to get a lovely amount of damage down to the whole enemy team.\n\nWhile you\u2019re good in the late game, you\u2019re incredibly squishy. Lookout and be cautious when trying to get a good Ultimate R off so you don\u2019t get killed before a fight breaks out."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Can be killed almost immediately if she is caught out of range from any of her allies. Same applies if her W is on cooldown.\n\nHer E costs a lot of mana so she is very susceptible to poke damage. Once out of mana, she can\u2019t really do a lot in the lane.\n\nShe will often be left alone to go and ward, which you can capitalise on. Or, she will not go to ward without a carry, which you can abuse to gain an advantage over her."}
{"text": "As ashe, At level 9, Ashe will have her maximum y. It's an important peak of power for Ashe because she can use it to bring down the enemy before her team engages in a team fight. When Ashe reaches level 11, she will put a secondary point in her Ultimate w. Her Ultimate w will have a short cooldown and she will be able to look for choices frequently throughout the middle of the game. Ashe should have finished one or two articles during the middle of the game. This makes her a huge threat in team fights that her performance of damage in conjunction with her poke can be devastating to manage."}

If you\u2019re strong at level 6, try to abuse her.\n\nAfter she has her first item completed, Taliyah can quickly push the wave with her Q. Ensure you\u2019re always behind the minion wave or outside of it so she cannot push and poke at the same time. \n\nThe more items she gets the stronger Taliyah will be.

{"text": "As chogath, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Use your e to launch a fight or try to take someone with it and then kill them. Once they are dead, either pass to the Baron or the Elder Dragon or seat and try to end the game.

Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to bring down the enemy and delay fighting in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not let yourself be caught trying to harass and bring down the enemy."}
{"text": "As garen, His Passive allows him to stay in the lane even after taking a lot of poke damage/all-in damage from the enemy team. This can also bait the enemy team into wasting a lot of valuable summoner spells.\n\nHis E allows him to do more damage in 1 v 1\u2019s (as the damage is increased if the enemy is alone). This lets him do a lot of damage with one complete rotation of his abilities, and unlike Garen, the enemy probably won\u2019t be able to regenerate a lot of health and stay in the lane.\n\nHe is really good when flanking the enemy team with his Q and E. Besides that, his W tenacity will allow him to get out of the enemy team if he decides to dive in and disrupt them. Killing him is an ordeal that keeps mounting as the game goes on."}
{"text": "As bard, His roaming potential is unrivaled as he can almost always get to another lane more quickly than his counterpart, as well as get out of sticky situations by using his E.\n\nThe ability to sustain both his ADC and himself with his W, while also getting more mana from collecting his Passive chimes allows him to stay in the lane for a long time. Due to his Passive, he can quickly switch between staying in lane and roaming.\n\nA good Ultimate R can help his team initiate a fight and set up a wombo-combo, especially when Bard manages to follow his Ultimate up with his Q. This ability can also be used to stall neutral objectives and disengage if need be."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Consistent poke damage with his W and Q which can allow him to push the enemy laners out of the lane abruptly. This can also allow him to all-in enemies once they are low enough after taking the barrage of poke Ezreal has to offer.\n\nHis Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during the early game to waveclear. This is very helpful when he is trying to clear the wave quickly in order to get a recall.\n\nEzreal\u2019s E allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease and makes him one of the safest ADCs in the game. He can also buffer it in response to CC abilities which will allow him to avoid follow up CC if he manages to get hit by the initial CC ability."}

It will also help a lot when dealing with neutral objectives.\n\nDepending on the ability he is maxing first, he will either be doing lots of damage with his r or blowing people up with his E from level nine. This is because that ability will be maxed out at that point."}

{"text": "As jinx, The CC extension on its kit with its W and E is very strong and can allow its support to play really successful. This is especially true if it is paired with a hard CC support. It can quite easily affect the team fights of a long range with its Ultimate R, especially if it involves bringing down an enemy champion who has managed to survive a fight with a burst of health. Its Passive can turn the tide of a fight when it manages to activate it. The increased statistics help his kite as well as do much more damage in a very short time."}
{"text": "As ekko, At level 16, Ekkos Ultimate R will do a lot of damage and will be on a really short refreshment. He can look for incredibly aggressive games every time he's up. Several articles offer him low refreshments and lots of brilliant damage. Do not be afraid to go for the games. The teams will group closely in the end of the game. It's good for Ekko because it can allow him to get a multi-person W out and CC all the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against sett, Avoid regrouping closely as this can allow Sett to get a multi-person E that will help his team win the team fight. Slightly split up will be better for you in the long run. Don't walk too far in setting a goal as Sett can use his Ultimate R to take the closest champion and throw them into their allies behind them. If you are grouped together and online with each other, it will be harder for him to do it. When there is no team fight, Sett will set himself in a side lane and try to divide the thrust. When he is alone, you could look for him or start a team fight with his allies when he is unable to help them."}
{"text": "As sett, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing.

If he enters, try and CC him as soon as possible to stop him and prevent him from pushing your team towards his. After his first back, Azir will push constantly. Try and choose champions who have the pressure to kill and can match his clear wave so that you don't lose your Tour early."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Vel'Koz will have his Q maxed at level 9. This means that he will deal more poke damage and completely dismantle an enemy team from range.\n\nHe will have two points in his Ultimate R once he hits level 11. This means that Vel'Koz will use the Ultimate R more efficiently as a finishing move to get rid of low health targets.\n\nTeam fights are going to be really good for Vel'Koz due to his kit.

As he will be overextended, this will allow your Jungler to gank your lane. This will also force him to use his Ultimate y or e to farm with- which you can capitalise on. "}
{"text": "Against zed, As Zed is an Assassin, he will look to take down targets that are walking around the map alone. Avoid moving through the river if it\u2019s not warded. Keep a constant eye on the map and do not put yourself in the same area as Zed if you don\u2019t know his exact whereabouts.\n\nExpect Zed to flank and takedown squishy targets with his Ultimate R. Ensure that your flanks are warded when sieging an objective so he cannot get the jump on you. \n\nDuring the mid-game, Zed will often be in a side lane split pushing. With this in mind, you could use the fact that he cannot impact the fight to start a team fight 4v4 or 5v4 with the numbers advantage."}
{"text": "Against taric, Disengagement as soon as Taric has activated his Ultimate R so that the enemy takes damage. If a target is weak however, try to shoot them down quickly before the Ultimate R comes into effect. Taric has surprisingly good engagement and catch the potential with his E. Watch his positioning at any time so it's really hard for him to catch someone."}
{"text": "As elise, Similarly to her level 6, Elise doesn\u2019t spike at level 11. Again, keep this in mind when fighting enemy Junglers at level 11.\n\nAt level 9, Elise will max her Q. This is a good level spike for Elise as it allows her to outtrade most enemy Junglers in a 1v1 fight.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Elise should\u2019ve completed multiple items. She will be good during the mid-game, and with the more items she gets."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Nautilus is very early thanks to the amount of CC he has in his kit. But, it can be really weak if he's in a bad matchup. At level 6, Nautilus has great gank set up and can go to kill in his way or in others. If you can't install your Jungler, look halfway and help your Mid Laner. When Nautilus has finished its first component, his trading power in the track increases considerably."}
{"text": "As aatrox, You will want the CC as much as possible. You may even be able to interrupt its dash using your *Q*. A certain reduction in healing will help you a lot in this matchup. Make a point not to let it support you. Always look at the ult before it can reach your allies. In this way, you will be able to kill it quickly with your team. The wave can be kept close to your turn if necessary. Make sure you build an important wave before looking for an all-in."}
{"text": "As seraphine, During the mid-game, your goal will be to wave clear and get lane priority. The mid-lane would definitely be better for you but don't forget to show up for skirmishes.\n\nUse your Ultimate R very carefully, as it can be the deciding factor when it comes to winning a fight. Use the ability to CC multiple targets and chain it with your E CC.\n\nFights around closed spaces will help you a lot as you can target multiple champions easily. Your Ultimate R and E should be pretty easy to land.        "}
{"text": "As corki, At level 13, Corki maximizes his second ability which is usually his n. It is a very powerful peak for Corki as it will allow him to shred tanks in the end-of-game team fights. At level 16, Corki will put the third and final point in his Ultimate e. As the teams will regroup at this stage of the game, he will be able to bring them down a lot before starting a fight. Corki is very good in the late game as long as he is not late. Try and avoid falling behind in the early game to make you an overwhelming force to count in the late game."}
{"text": "As viego, Viegos Passive is only as strong as the composition of the enemy team. If the team is chosen from a team that lacks damage, turning into them could be unrivalled. Viego is a tough champion to master: in particular, playing around your Passive and your R can be quite difficult for beginners. Viego has little utility and his W cannot help him overcome the walls. It is a disadvantage compared to the other mobile champions in the current meta."}
{"text": "As sett, A maximum-out Ultimate will increase frequently, and team fighting will become a breeze during this part of the game. His damage is massive during the end of the game, especially with his W. He will have to use it at an appropriate time for maximum efficiency. He is a decent team fighter during this phase of the game. He can regenerate his health quickly because his Passive and his real damage W will melt through the enemy health bars."}
{"text": "As braum, Drive around the map and look for choices with your r. If you can catch someone, call for a nearby goal and abuse their timer of death. Place the vision around the medium track and never you and your ADC are playing. This will increase your chances of surviving an all-in. Stay with your ADC throughout the middle of the game. If you are alone, you will be an easy target for the enemy. Similarly, if your ADC is alone, they could try to collapse on them and kill them."}
{"text": "As nocturne, It will give you a significant long-term advantage. Don't forget to use the spell shield correctly in the track. It should be used to counter hard CC capabilities or bursting damage capabilities. Getting your Ultimate has will allow you to easily choose enemies. Keep an eye on the side tracks and make sure that you all when possible."}
{"text": "As karthus, Focus on power farming. You will need to hit level 6 as quickly as possible to unlock your Ultimate e.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, keep an eye on the minimap and the enemies health bars. Whenever your Ultimate e is up, you\u2019ll have global map pressure.\n\nPlay safe in the early game. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you will struggle to farm and you will delay your first major power spike."}
{"text": "As shaco, During the laning phase, he is very easy to abuse and poke down. He is best picked into tank champions.\n\nIf Shaco is behind, it will be very hard for him to get back into the game. Shaco relies on getting ahead to be useful in the later parts of the game.\n\nShaco can be hard to master. You need to avoid being super obvious with your plays, especially with your Ultimate l otherwise, you\u2019ll fool no one."}
{"text": "As elise, Similarly to level 6 and 11, Elise doesn\u2019t spike too much at 16 when she puts a third point in her Ultimate.\n\nIn the late game, Elise\u2019s E will be on a short cooldown. This allows her to look for more picks and potentially win her team the game.\n\nThe more items Elise gets, the stronger she will be. However, in the late game it will be harder for her to kill the enemy as they will be tankier."}
{"text": "As veigar, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. Now, he can do about a quarter of the health bar of a squishy target with his e. At level 11, he will have two points in his ultimate R. This will massively amplify his damage, and Veigar will easily be able to shoot enemies and squishy tanks at once. Veigar will now have several piles, which will grant him a lot of free power. This is terrible news for the enemy team because Veigar will soon be unstoppable."}
{"text": "As anivia, Whenever Anivia\u2019s Passive is down, she is incredibly vulnerable to an all-in. Play safer whenever it is on cooldown.\n\nPre-6, Anivia has minimal threat in lane. She needs to play safe and wait for her level 6 power spike before she can start to lane properly. Focus on farming and playing safe in the early game.\n\nAnivia relies heavily on mana throughout all stages of the game. She needs to get Tear as quickly as she can, and she needs every blue buff after the first one to constantly keep her m up."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Poke the enemy and harass them as much as you can before looking to fight. Bursting someone down with a few Q\u2019s and your R will allow you to force a team fight with the numbers or health advantage.\n\nAvoid using your E aggressively in late game fights as you\u2019ll be vulnerable briefly. Only use it aggressively if you\u2019re 100% sure you cannot get abused for it.\n\nStick with your team and avoid walking too far away from them. If you get caught out, your team will lose out on a lot of damage in a team fight, and it would be your fault. Stick with your team as much as possible."}
{"text": "As galio, If his E is missing, the enemy team can literally walk up to him (not within control) and continue to poach and harass him for a long time. Can't do much if the enemy keeps the river (if it is halfway) / track brushes (if it is in support). As soon as the enemy sees Galio coming out of the way, they will begin to play safely and deny the threat of Galio. Galio's effectiveness is greatly reduced if the enemy team positions properly and the spaces during a fight. He is decent against the magical damage but the AD champions can tear themselves through him, especially after using his E."}
{"text": "As pantheon, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As renekton, You will want to keep poking him down with your e in this matchup. It will make it really easy for you to take Renekton down quickly.\n\nKeep your Resource Bar half filled before a trade to deal maximal damage to the enemy. This is important to counter his burst.\n\nYour Ultimate will allow you to easily all-in Renekton or separate him from his team. Use this opportunity to turn the tide of the fight in your favor.\n\nKeep the wave in the middle of the lane for as long as possible in this matchup. This will help a lot when it comes to dealing with his all-ins."}
{"text": "As brand, Brands Ultimate R is very good in team fights as it can bounce between enemies. If the enemy is grouped in the jungle, its damage release will be very high. Brand has good ganks in early play. As long as it gets closer to the enemy before using its Q, ganks should always work in his favor. It has a healthy clear in the current meta. As long as you camp kites, you should stay relatively healthy on your first ganks."}
{"text": "As gragas, Avoid Gragas' Q as much as you can because it can set up ganks for his team and causes a lot of damage.\n\nUtilize Gragas' W cooldown, which has a considerable duration and may be exploited to engage on him.\n\nWatch out for Gragas' E which enables him to close gaps fast and it can also serve as an escape route.\n\nTry to save your Ultimate for when Gragas uses his ultimate since, if he pushes you into his team, you could all-in with it quickly."}
{"text": "As olaf, The last point in his Ultimate k will give him a massive peak, and he will be able to deposit tons of damage to the enemy. Since the ability will increase frequently, he will be able to take targets easily. His tankness will be phenomenal during this phase of the game. Combined with his overall damage, it will become difficult to deal with him for the enemy team. Olaf will certainly fall during the end of the game as the enemies begin to build defensive objects. The brilliant damage of the enemy team will allow them to take Olaf quickly."}
{"text": "As twitch, His e, when combined with his increase in attack speed is a strength to count with. He can get several early murders with this combo (and decent support if he is ADC). When in the jungle, the Red Buff can amplify the effects of this combo. His Ultimate c and Passive allow him to shred through the enemy team with ease when they find themselves grouped. This gives him a very strong advantage in the choking points. He can use his s to scrutinize and fix a vision for his team too."}
{"text": "Against draven, The biggest weakness for Draven is crowd control (especially stons, traps, knock-ups). If you play a champion with skill shots and CC, target them at the Axe g drop location. Draven is one of the best snowball champions in the game thanks to his Passive and g. If you can't win the 2v2, ask your Jungler to come and reset his Adoration piles (Passive) by killing him. Draven can trade most of the champions in the early game. You shouldn't look to fight him unless he drops an Axe g."}
{"text": "As xerath, Xerath's level 6 is very powerful since it can sniper targets of one long range at a time in its track or another. Damage production will increase with the items, so it will only make it more powerful. The first purchase of the item will make Xerath extremely heinous in the track. That's because its poke damage will be very high, and the enemy will be be beheaded even before they can reach it."}
{"text": "As drmundo, Be the first line for your team at all times. It's the key that when you play Dr. Mundo, you're always at the front of your team. When no team fight occurs, look to split the thrust and draw the enemy's attention to you while your team tries to sit another goal somewhere else on the map. After being the first line for your team, fall back and peel for your portages with your Q to keep them alive. If they die quickly, the team fight stops while you're going to lack damage."}
{"text": "As tristana, The slow on her W can allow her to get kills quite easily. She will need to whittle her target down before that, or she can rely on a gank or her Support.\n\nHer E tower damage allows her to procure plates and destroy towers with ease. This will put her ahead in the lane, as well as get rapid objectives if she is left unchecked.\n\nHer self peeling ability is quite strong and she can get out of sticky situations with both her W and Ultimate R. This arguably makes her one of the safest carries in the game."}
{"text": "As poppy, Focus on getting a level 3 first so that you can reliably gank. Try to ask your trackers to give you a hard leash and make good use of your passive. Once level 3, you will want to actively target high-extended targets when you get the chance. This will allow you to get your trackers in advance and will allow you to assert a lot of pressure in the game. Level six is not so huge of a power peak. It allows you to win neutral, objective fights, however. You can just Ultimate R the enemy Jungler away so they can't Smit the goal."}
{"text": "As malphite, Weak during the early game, especially against consistent poke damage which can prevent him from regenerating his Passive shield.\n\nPre-six, he is quite susceptible to poke so he will be forced to play defensively. He probably won\u2019t be getting any ganks either due to him not having his Ultimate.\n\nProper vision control from the enemy team will prevent Malphite from catching the enemy team off-guard. This will reduce his effectiveness and will force him to find other ways to engage on the enemy team. "}
{"text": "As pantheon, The track brushes must be controlled by you as they will allow you to catch the out-of-guard enemies with your W. It also goes off-minion enemy zone. Continue poking the enemy with your Q as much as you can. It is difficult to avoid, and the damage will quickly accumulate and leave you all enemies. Your Ultimate R will allow you to make cross card games with ease. You can even wander directly after the reminder and then show to your original path with your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As taric, Taric will have his Q maxed at level 9. This means that he will heal a lot during a fight as long as he has enough mana to constantly use the ability. At level 11, Taric will have two points in his Ultimate R. This means that he will be able to use the ability frequently, which will make him powerful enough in team combat. At level thirteen, Taric will have two of his maximum capabilities out. This means that he will excel in team combat and will be successfully peeled for his port."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, Shyvana will try to delay a team fight so that she can harass you and harass you with her l in the shape of Dragon t. Fight as soon as you can so that she can't shoot you down and from a distance. Shyvana can flank on the side with her Ultimate t and her l. Make sure you have your flanks watched so you can see her before she gets the chance to crash and shoot you."}
{"text": "As pyke, Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. Your goal during the laning phase is to search for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As corki, Delay a team fight as long as possible while you push and harass the enemy with your b & e. Once the enemy is low, you can engage in combat. When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to cultivate during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done. Avoid overextension or die alone. When you are dead, the enemy may be able to sit a goal, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, The final point in his Ultimate n will allow him to deal tremendous amounts of damage to the enemies. He should try to look for flanks during team fights to maximize his Ultimate n usage.\n\nHe will have many items now, which will make him really tanky and will allow him to deal lots and lots of damage in a short amount of time. The enemy team will have a hard time dealing with him.\n\nWukong is pretty substantial during this phase of the game. Still, he will have a hard time killing them due to them purchasing defensive items. You will want to group up with your team as frequently as you can."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, In team fights, make sure no one on your team is too far ahead that Malzahar can try to catch someone out of position with his Ultimate R. When you sit goals or step back from a fight, look at your positioning that you can walk in Malzahars Q that can be devastating to your health bar. As soon as Malzhar concentrates a champion with his Ultimate R, try the CC so the chain is cancelled."}
{"text": "Against illaoi, Most of the time, Illaoi will rush Black cleaver as it synergizes incredibly well with her kit. If she manages to complete this item before the 11-minute mark, she will 1 shot casters minions, making her push pretty much outmatched.\n \nIllaoi\u2019s power can spike around her Test of Spirit E max (level 9). This gives her the ability to do a great deal of damage to carries if she takes a side lane. Be aware of this power spike and inform whoever tries to match her in the side lane.\n \nAt level 13 most Illaoi\u2019s will have their Tentacle Slam Q and Test of Spirit E maxed. This will give Illaoi incredible skirmish & duelling potential. Try to pick her off or pick fights while she is away from her team."}
{"text": "Against talon, The more gold Talon gets, the stronger he will be. Even with one kill, he can easily snowball his lead. Avoid giving him kills when possible.\n\nOnce he has completed his first item and when he\u2019s unlocked his Ultimate R, Talon\u2019s power increases dramatically and his skirmishing strength will be unstoppable. Avoid fighting 1v1 unless you have an advantage.\n\nTalon has the same power spikes in the jungle as he does in the mid lane."}
{"text": "As sion, Just hide in the track brushes and wait for the enemies to show up near the brush in which you hide. Your Q will easily take care of them if the brush is not awarded. Always try to slow down your enemies by using your E on the minions so that it hits the champion. Also, make sure you use your W correctly in this matchup. After six, look for the gank track your remaining allies. It will allow you to deposit a lot of damage and get your team a massive advance during the start of the game."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Once Aatrox reaches level 9, its Q will be maximized. The reduction of cooling time and additional precipitation will mean that this capacity is on a very short cooling time. During the middle of the game, Aatrox will have brought elements that will reduce its cooling capabilities. Through levels 9-13, its capabilities will be on a very short cooling time. When Aatrox touches level 11 and puts two points in its Ultimate, it will be a serious threat to the enemy in team fighting. Fight around your Ultimate to do a ton of damage and survive team fighting."}
{"text": "As zac, The fog of war should be used to catch the out-of-the-box enemies whenever you have the chance. This will allow your team to track and get easy murders on the enemy, especially around the choking points. Continue wandering and try to get peaks with your Jungler. You are extremely good at it, and securing peaks should be easy due to the enemy team changing track tasks frequently. You will need to keep the safety of your teammates in mind while looking for an all-in-one."}
{"text": "As shaco, Getting 2 points in his Ultimate l will make Shaco's dueling capacity skyrocket. He can easily hide somewhere and use his clone to heckle enemies and deal free damage to them.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This makes it really hard for the enemy to catch him during all-ins, and Shaco will easily be able to deal a lot of damage without taking a lot back in return.\n\nShaco is really good at getting picks with the team during this phase of the game. He can easily set up death brushes and use his x to poke the enemies out before a neutral, objective fight.        "}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine is an easy champion to learn. You don\u2019t need to spend as much time into learning her compared to someone like Akali or Camille.\n\nShe has a lot of CC thanks to her Passive, E and Ultimate R. She also has a heal and shield with her W. This makes her a great utility champion.\n\nHer Ultimate R has the potential to hit the whole enemy team. The more champions you hit too, the further it will go. If you\u2019re able to get a good Ultimate R off, you will increase your chances of winning the team fight."}
{"text": "As kayn, When you face Kayn, use your Ultimate on the other laner not Kayn. Ward for your allies! Kayn is much stronger than you early, and you can decrease their early power by keeping for your allies, so they don't die for ganks. Playing around your Ultimate is the key in this matchup. You waste ganking opportunities when you sit on your Ultimate and don't glove your allies. Make sure you place quarters at your jungle entrances so you can spot them before they jump on you."}
{"text": "As corki, Corki is really good in team fighting thanks to the AOE poke of his b and Ultimate e. It can be good post 6 because he has a lot of poke and clear wave. This can help him get early turret plates and kills. Outside of the laning phase, and in team fighting, Corki has a lot of poke. Delaying team fighting as long as possible while you harass and intimidate the enemy."}
{"text": "Against katarina, Hold on to your CC abilities until Katarina has engaged. If you can interrupt her as soon as she channels her Ultimate R, her damage output will be low and you\u2019ll have a higher chance of winning the team fight.\n\nAvoid fighting in areas that are tight and enclosed. Katarina has insane AOE damage and if your team is grouped closely together, she will be able to melt you down. Try and fight in areas that leave your team split slightly apart.\n\nForcing a team fight when Katarina\u2019s Zhonyas is down is a good way of taking her out of the team fight quickly. This will reduce her ability to take over the team fight with her resets."}
{"text": "Against sion, One of Sion's power peaks is at level 6 when it unlocks its Ultimate R. It offers it additional death pressure and survival. Sion's element power peaks depend on which construction it goes. It has two distinct building paths (damage and reservoir) and each peak at different times. Fewer track champions should give it a little space at level 3 than Sion can do a surprising amount of damage in the right matchup."}
{"text": "As viego, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nThey can secure objective so much easier than you can. Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nPost 6, avoid fighting them at all costs as they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will easily kill you.\n\nHe will be ganking a lot early on. Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As talon, Flank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nAfter your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "As gragas, Make sure that the neutral objective pit is out of bounds for the enemy Jungler during fights. It will help your Jungler secure the objective quickly and without any risk of missing smite.\n\nAlways respond faster than the enemy Support when fights break out in the river. Due to your kit, you should have quite an easy time all-in'ing and disrupting escaping enemies.\n\nRoaming is going to help you a lot, especially when your ADC is not in the lane. Use your E, Q, and Ultimate R to completely cut off an enemy laners escape while roaming.        "}
{"text": "Against kalista, Kalista is vulnerable to slows and CC. Try to lock her down at the beginning of the fight so she is unable to dish out lots of damage.\n\nKalista may stay in a side lane to split push. When she is not with her team, you can force a team fight or take an objective.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know where Kalista and her Jungler are, they might be trying to sneak the Baron or Dragon. Make sure you have it warded at all times as she can take it quite easily thanks to her r. "}
{"text": "As taliyah, Keep poking the enemy with your Q and E in the lane. Try not to use your Q in the middle of the lane to ensure that you can regularly throw multiple pellets of your Q.\n\nUse the terrain to traverse the map quicker with the help of your Passive. Also, use your C carefully as that ability can quickly get you free kills in the Jungle.\n\nYour Ultimate R will allow you to roam around a lot more in this game. It will enable you to prevent enemies from entering crucial points like the neutral objective pits or separate out enemies."}
{"text": "As kayle, It is important that you concentrate the closest enemy champion and your allies concentrate. Unless your ADC is behind you, you could use your Ultimate R on them to keep them alive while they take the damage. If you're ahead, keep your Ultimate R for yourself."}
{"text": "As senna, Just like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone as you will die easily.\n\nDo not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and auto-attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will focus you and take you down.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen will have three points in his Ultimate R at level 16, which will give him a massive increase in damage and the luxury of using capacity frequently. Of course, this helps a lot when he manages to catch an out-of-guard enemy. His tankness is overcharged during the late part due to all his articles. However, he will not die much and can easily delimit the enemy of his team, especially if the enemy team has a murderer who likes to dive the allied backline. Garen will have a lot of articles now, which will give him both a blow of damage and survival in the way."}
{"text": "As gwen, In the late game, stay with your team. Avoid moving too far away from them as the enemy may force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion in team fights. Even with your W, you are still squishy and vulnerable to the enemy backline. Focus the same champion as the one your allies are focusing.\n\nYou can dish out a ton of damage in late game team fights with your empowered Q damage. Ensure you\u2019re auto-attacking as much as you can to increase your Q damage."}
{"text": "Against garen, Deny Garen's Passive by automatically attacking it whenever possible. This will reduce its hold on the track and make it easier to kill it. Garen's E deals extra damage to isolated targets. You can mitigate the damage by fighting next to your minions. They will also start concentrating it if it attacks you automatically. Try and stay at maximum distance at any time against Garen. This will reduce its all-in-one potential. Moreover, by staying at the maximum possible distance, it will have to waste its Q to get in the range of you to trade. You can capitalize on this and look to trade with it while it is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As sylas, His Ultimate R is completely dependent on the enemy team comp. If the enemy has lacklustre ultimates, Sylas won\u2019t be able to do much.\n\nIf used improperly, his W can get him killed due to him getting displaced to another location. If the enemy purchases Grievous Wounds, they can easily counter this heal by a good amount.\n\nProper vision placement can ruin his chances of being able to flank the enemy team with his E. He won\u2019t be able to effectively impact a fight when he can\u2019t flank the enemy team."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Be a part of neutral objective fights. Your Ultimate R will be particularly useful to push the enemy Jungler out of the neutral objective. Look for choices with your Jungler whenever possible. It will allow you to accumulate a massive advance and allow you to take the game by hand. Don't forget to cultivate in the game that you still need your basic elements to win the game. If you succeed in accumulating an advance, make sure you push harder and get other ways forward."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Make sure you're never near a wall otherwise Poppy will be able to use her E and push you in. Every time Poppy throws her Buckler and it lands near you, try to move on it. However, do not commit too much to destroy it because she can use your positioning to play aggressive. Post 6 it=\"s will be difficult for you to kill Poppy because she will probably use her Ultimate R to shoot you. Keep this in mind and keep on all CC capabilities until she starts the chain."}
{"text": "As ekko, At level 16, Ekko\u2019s Ultimate R will deal a lot of damage and be on a really short cooldown. He can look for insanely aggressive plays whenever it is up.\n\nMultiple items offer him low cooldowns and a lot of burst damage. Don\u2019t be afraid to go for plays.\n\nTeams will group closely in the late game. This is good for Ekko because it can allow him to get a multi-person W off and CC the whole of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As sett, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the team fights at the end of the game. To get on the enemy's backline quickly, try to use the war fog to flank the enemy. If you fllank with a bush not awarded, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid separating or being away from your team in the game at the end of the game, as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play with your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without this will make the team fighting at the end of the game much more difficult."}
{"text": "As gangplank, The Ultimate R of Gangplank will be a force to count with now as it will have several updates and give it additional benefits. This will increase its team fighting force of many. Now it will have three points in its Ultimate R. With reduced cooling and damage, Gangplank will be able to take the game effortlessly. This is the point of the game where Gangplank becomes really scary. It has a truck load of items, its barrels can legitimately one-shot someone, and it can effortlessly pursue people with its Ultimate R. The enemies will have no option but to walk on the plane at this stage."}
{"text": "As fiora, Fiora is weak in the game very early. She needs time and elements before coming online. However, she has a lot of total pressure. Her first major power peak is when she gets her first element. It offers her extra pressure to kill in the way and will allow her to get a lead. At level 6, Fiora will unlock her ultimate R. Her pressure to kill will intensify again and she will be able to look for more risky all-in thanks to the healing he provides."}
{"text": "As amumu, Your Ultimate is an incredible tool that can cause damage and CC all the enemy team if you are able to hit them all with it. This makes Aumu an incredibly strong team fighter. Aumu, the construction path is incredibly versatile. Your team needs a tank? You can build a tank. Your team needs AP? You can build AP. If you are ahead, you can go for a complete AP build and blow up enemies. Aumu has a quick light thanks to the AOE damage of its r and m. This allows it to clean up quickly and hit its level 6 power peak before many other Junglers."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, If you're strong at level 6, try to abuse it. After she's finished her first article, Taliyah can quickly push the wave with her Q. Make sure you're still behind the minion wave or outside of it so she can't push and poke at the same time. The more items she gets the strongest Taliyah will be. Avoid letting her drop you with Q because she's going to inflict a lot of damage. In particular, don't let her delay a team fight with her Q."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton will look to split push when no team fights are occuring. Make sure someone who can contest him is stopping him from split pushing. Do not send someone who is unable to beat him to stop him from pushing.\n\nFor his e to be effective, he will need to get as close to the enemy as possible in a team fight. With this in mind, Renekton will probably try to flank in a team fight rather than run towards you. Make sure your flanks are warded so you can spot him before he gets the chance to engage.\n\nRenekton has great pick potential so watch your positioning. It is not uncommon for Renekton to Flash e to catch someone out who is too far forward."}
{"text": "Against renata, At level 6, you will need to play a little more respectful because she can install picks and her Jungler with her Ultimate R. If she uses her W on her ADC, wait until the spell runs out before engaging in a hard fight. He has a very long cooldown and she can be abused while he is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As quinn, Yet again, Quinn doesn\u2019t really spike at level 16 as her Ultimate R is a utility tool rather than a pure damage tool.\n\nQuinn starts to fall off in the later parts of the game as enemies will be buying items that offer them extra protection from her damage.\n\nThankfully, the more items Quinn gets, the more of a problem she will be for the enemy team. As long as she looks for picks with her team, she should be okay in the late game."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Its Q alone can force the enemy to remember at the base if it continues to be labelled by it. Can move enemy units in its E using its W. This can act as a really good finishing movement against weak enemies, or it can be used to fire an escape when necessary. Is a threat to remember against as a bad reminder can allow it to take the enemy tower very quickly due to its Passive and W."}
{"text": "Against zed, If you\u2019re playing as a ranged champion, try to harass and poke Zed down. Avoid over-committing to harassing him though as minion damage does stack heavily.\n\nInvest in early armor when playing as a Mage to protect you from Zed\u2019s damage. This will reduce his chances of killing you.\n\nTry to play to the opposite side of the lane at all times. This will make it hard for Zed to get on to you without using his W. Once he does use his W, move to the opposite side of his Shadow W so he can\u2019t get on top of you."}
{"text": "As riven, The first item component will allow her to deal a lot of damage and survive the lane. It will also be conducive when trying to go for all-in combos.\n\nLevel six is a massive spike for her as she can now affect fights easily with her t and r. Her e usage will dictate how good a Riven she is.\n\nShe is a decent champion early on, especially if she manages to use the lane brushes to her advantage in the lane. Her all-in combo will be pretty potent if she catches her enemies off-guard.        "}
{"text": "Against darius, Darius is one of the best duelers in the game, so don\u2019t overstay your welcome. Do not go for extended trades with him as he will always come out ahead. \n \nDarius will look to reposition when using his e. Try and stay in the inner ring so it doesn\u2019t deal much damage.\n \nDarius is relatively immobile and weak when he is getting attacked by multiple champions. Let him push, poke him down and then request a Jungle gank for a guaranteed kill."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. She will not be able to use her E very much if she is pushed up.\n\nPost 6, beware of her strong burst and all-in potential with her Ultimate R. Try and stay far back from her if you\u2019re low.\n\nHer Q is blocked by minions and so is her W. Always stand inside or around the minion wave to make it hard for her to harass you.\n"}
{"text": "Against illaoi, Most of the time, Illaoi will rush Black clearr because he synergizes incredibly well with his kit. If she manages to finish this article before the 11 minute mark, she will pull 1 casters minions, which makes her push quite outdated. Illaoi's power can be accentuated around her Test of Spirit E max (level 9). This gives her the ability to do a lot of damage to carry if she takes a side track. Be aware of this power peak and inform the one who tries to join her in the side track. At level 13 most Illaoi's will have their Tentacle Slam Q and Test of Spirit E maxed. This will give Illaoi incredible potential of escarmouche and duelling. Try to choose her or choose fighting while she is away from her team."}
{"text": "As orianna, The first element will allow him to inflict more damage and spam his abilities due to the increase of the mana. The level six is a massive peak due to his grip on his Ultimate d. This will allow him to make games of his own or in combination with his team. She is not really big before six because she can easily be caught and killed."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Yasuo is really strong once he has 100% crit chance. Thanks to his Passive, he can get to this stage quite quickly.\n\nOnce Yasuo is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his kill pressure increases. You should play respectfully whenever his Ultimate R is up as he can quite easily kill you.\n\nYasuo is really good in team fights if he is picked in a team with multiple knock-ups. Avoid grouping too closely otherwise, he could get a 5 person Ultimate R off."}
{"text": "As vladimir, A maximum-out Ultimate e will massively injure the enemy team. Any fight around the bottlenecks will allow Vladimir to win the fight immediately because of its maintenance and damage. Several articles will allow him to inflict more damage to the enemies, especially those who fight together during the team fights. He should be relatively sure as well and heal from a ton of damage. His life flying and damage during the end of the match will make him really good in the team fights. He will just need to use his l and Q at the right time, and he will be unqualified."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Continuing to pick up and secure the jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall back in the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to grow! When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. The more the Master Yi d'Or has, the stronger it will be. If your team gets a murder or two, call for the Baron or Dragon. You should be able to easily take them as Master Yi."}
{"text": "As taric, Take advantage of your range advantage and consistently harass Taric whenever possible. Utilize your auto-attacks and abilities to poke him down and apply pressure in lane.\n\nBe prepared to use your E (Zoomies) ability to reposition yourself and dodge Taric's E (Dazzle) stun. This will help you avoid being caught out of position and mitigate his crowd control.\n\nIf possible, try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This forces Taric and his ADC to overextend for farm, creating opportunities for your jungler to capitalize on and potentially secure kills or summoner spells.\n\nEnsure that you and your ADC reach level 2 at the same time as Taric. Taric may look to engage and fight early at level 2, so it's important to be prepared and ready to respond."}
{"text": "Against lux, Lux is really strong once she unlocks her Ultimate n. At this stage, she will be able to get kills and burst you down.\n\nOnce Lux has max cooldown reduction, her abilities will be on really low cooldowns. This means she\u2019ll be able to poke and trade quite frequently. Do not get caught out by her low cooldowns.\n\nIn the later stages of the game, Lux is really strong and can quite easily take down any target if she lands her g. Try and set her behind in the early game so she is unable to get tons of AP and snowball."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Focus on Seraphine's health bar and force her to use her mana up. Once this is done, you can push her out of the way with ease. Get some serious injuries as quickly as you can in this matchup. It will give you a massive advantage during early play. Be part of as many neutral goal fights as you can in this matchup. Your AoE-based capabilities can give you a lot of advantage. Push in this matchup as it will give you a significant advantage. Take the enemy tower quickly down."}
{"text": "As rumble, If your allies move on your track after destroying their turn, rotate and move around the map to continue growing and winning XP and gold. Use your capabilities to quickly clear the minion waves so your team can besiege/prevent an enemy team seat. If you can land poke while also pushing the minion wave, you can look for a favorable trade. By sitting Baron or Dragon, or whenever you push the enemy under their turn, look for a peak with your abilities. If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you will be able to take the goal for free."}
{"text": "Against akali, Akali has a powerful early game with her Q and Passive. She will try to harass you every time you go for CS. Avoid letting her harass for free on you while keeping your distance and stay at the maximum range at all times. If she uses her Q and he hits, don't walk forward for a while. Akali hasn't integrated support and she has poor basic statistics. She's also melee. Use this to your advantage to trade with her early and harass when she goes for CS. A good time to trade with her is when she used/missed her Q. Akali."}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Kassadin will be divided by pushing in the middle of the game so that he can reach his level 16 power peak and then try to flank in the team fights with his Ultimate k. If you see that Kassadin is divided by pushing, you can try to start a team fight with the advantage of numbers because he won't be able to join the fight quickly."}
{"text": "As hwei, However, a disadvantage for him to have a lot of abilities is that it can make him quite complicated and overwhelming for the players. He also has a lot of combos in his kit, which makes him quite difficult to master. He is a difficult champion for beginners to learn from. When he is behind, he is not so good. Although he has AOE and a lot of damage, he does nothing in the fights when behind."}
{"text": "As ryze, You're stronger than Ryze at level 6 than your Ultimate deals damage. It's an agriculture game, especially in early play. Focus on agriculture and trap it with your abilities. Watch your positioning at all times. Stay away from the minion wave so it can't push you and poke at the same time with its E and Q. Once you've got your first component element, start pushing it with your abilities."}
{"text": "As rumble, His first power spike is when he gets his first component item as this increases the damage output from his Q and E.\n\nOnce you hit level 6, Rumble will unlock his Ultimate. This ability allows him to deal extra damage and adds kill pressure.\n\nHe isn\u2019t the strongest champion at levels 1 and 2, but he can start to trade more successfully post-level 3.\n"}
{"text": "As trundle, Really good objective control which can allow him to stop relying on his team and get his team ahead on his own terms. He can take early dragons with ease, without getting too low.\n\nHis Ultimate n allows him to gain an immense amount of dueling potential which can allow him to go for high priority targets with ease, and then get out without dying.\n\nHis e can allow him to both set-up as well as follow up on ganks with ease. This is extremely advantageous when he has a Support who has a lot of crowd control in their kit."}
{"text": "Against vi, At level 6, Vi will have access to its Ultimate R. Whenever this capacity is increasing, its gank capacity increases considerably. When Vi reaches level 3/4, it will start gank thanks to its access to all its basic capabilities. Expects that it will begin to glove around this period. As soon as Vi gets Trinity Force, its release of damage and kill pressure increases a lot."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall behind in the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure to continue growing! As you are a Jungler, you must try to secure each Drake during the middle of the game. Get them and secure the Dragon soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game. Look for choices with your team. If you can choose someone, make the call for Baron or Dragon to continue your lead."}
{"text": "As galio, Your level 6 is much stronger than Galios. But it has the advantage of wandering. Post 6, just push it in its turn to win a gold lead. But make sure to keep your flanks and stand back after pushing so it can't everything in you. Abusive your range advantage to harass it as much as possible. Similarly, target your abilities so they grow and pokent at the same time. Fortunately, it has little to do to kill the pressure on you, so focus on stalking and get a lead."}
{"text": "As volibear, Extremely strong duelist, especially during the early game. He can force any enemy champion to at least use their Flash if he manages to catch them out of position.\n\nVolibear\u2019s Ultimate R can allow him to set tower dives very easily. This can be used to kill low health solo laners in the top lane, or kill the enemy bot lane while Jungling.\n\nHis pick potential during the mid-game can allow him to take objectives quite freely during the game. This can be converted to an easy win if he can work with his team."}
{"text": "Against sona, Catching Sona when she goes to the hall will allow your team to potentially allow you to take the Baron, Dragon or start a team fight when she is unable to protect her team. Avoid team fights in areas where you are forced to group together as inside an objective pit or in the jungle. This will allow Sona to get a multi-person Ultimate R. Try and group but not too closely together. In team fights, Sona will be standing next to her ADC. This could make it difficult for you to kill her."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie's best peak of power in the track is once it unlocks Tibbers R. She can look for aggressive choices and Flash plays with Tibbers and her dizziness. Annie will always be a little strong when she has her dizziness ready or almost ready. If the enemy seeks to fight you while you have max piled up, you can quickly spin around the fight. Once Annie has finished her first component element, her clear wave and trading power increases. In particular, her Q and W will do more in her favor."}
{"text": "As vi, Vi has excellent pick potential with her Ultimate R. The range allows her to catch enemies off-guard with her Ultimate R and kill her targets due to her burst damage.\n\nVi's objective control will still be preserved during this phase of the game. This means that she can quickly melt through towers with her E and take neutral objectives with ease.\n\nHer impact will be massive during the mid-game. This is because she will have her core items, and she will be able to pick enemies off with ease with her Ultimate R. She can easily flank the enemy and get to their backline.        "}
{"text": "As zed, The first item purchase will make Zed a mortal champion to manage. It should seek to wander other ways and clean kills on low-health / surstaying enemies. Level 3 is a decent power peak because Zed will now have access to its global burst combo. It can quickly go for short exchanges and runes with these abilities. It can spam them quite quickly as well as it is not dependent on the mana. Level 6 is a significant power peak for Zed. That's where it unlocks its full potential and can make games and movements to make enemies wonder what it was. It should also be able to dive low-health enemies and escape unharmed."}

If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "As diana, When Diana reaches near max build, she will deal an awful lot of damage to anyone who she catches out of position. \n\nAt level 16 and with 3 points in her Ultimate R, Diana\u2019s AOE damage and all-in potential will be extremely high. As teams will be grouping in the late game, she will be able to deal a lot of damage to multiple enemies at once.\n\nWhile Diana will deal a lot of damage in late game team fights, it may be harder for her to one-shot targets because enemies will start building defensive items to protect them from her burst."}
{"text": "As fizz, Stay close to your team in the late match. You should not be too far from them otherwise the enemy can force a fight or catch your team out of position. Look for choices with your Ultimate R in late fights. If you can choose someone who walks too far forward, you can use the number advantage to start another team fight. Group with your team in the late match, but try to stay hidden. This will allow you to get choices or initiate once the enemy walks too far forward or gets close to your team."}
{"text": "As taric, Taric will have his Q maxed at level 9. This means that he will heal a lot during a fight as long as he has enough mana to constantly use the ability. At level 11, Taric will have two points in his Ultimate R. This means that he will be able to use the ability frequently, which will make him powerful enough in team combat. At level thirteen, Taric will have two of his maximum capabilities out. This means that he will excel in team combat and will be successfully peeled for his port."}
{"text": "Against volibear, Buy items that provide Greek wounds such as Executioner=S Calling or Morellonomicon. This will prevent him from curing and surviving team fights. In team fights, avoid regrouping too closely as it will allow Volibear to get a great ultimate R out. Group, but not to stand too close together. Volibear has great potential of choice in the middle of play."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Use the track brushes to regularly land your e on the enemy. This will soon allow you to cut your enemy off the track. Your e must be used with extreme discretion in this matchup. Make sure the enemy has no form of CC on them before deciding to use the ability in the middle of a fight, Once you unlock your Ultimate r, you should have a really easy time running down not only in your way but also in other ways. Make sure you do everything you need to get a lead."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac has creative gank paths which makes warding against him a little tricker. The best way to ward against him is by placing wards on his jungle camps and near his jungle entrances rather than wards inside lane bushes. \n\nYou are really good at counter ganking and ganking in general. If you\u2019re nearby when the enemy Zac ganks, you should try to help your laner in need. If you\u2019re nowhere nearby, you can either gank another lane, move into their jungle or start the Drake.\n\nPrioritize taking Dragons early. You can solo the Dragon with ease, or you can request assistance and rotate to it after helping bot. Make sure you secure all the Dragons when possible to deny them from the enemy.\n\nWhen fighting the enemy, you win the fight as long as you\u2019re healthy, have your cooldowns and dodge the Zac\u2019s CC. If you do not dodge this ability before going in, you will not win the 1v1."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Look to fight her when she doesn\u2019t have many Q stacks as her ability to trade back with you will be reduced. Her damage output will be lower when she has no stacks.\n\nGood times to look for fights are when she has used her W. When she activates her W, she will gain bonus defensive stats. If you can bait it out, or disengage when her W is active, you will find it easier killing her when it is on cooldown.\n\nExtended trades work in her favour. Try and keep them short and sweet- around her Passive."}
{"text": "As azir, When no team fights are occurring, put yourself in a side lane and look to split push and farm side waves. Watch what your team is doing in case you need to move to help them at all times.\n\nDelay team fights for as long as possible while you try to harass the enemy with your long-ranged r and auto-attacks.\n\nUse your Ultimate R defensively in team fights. Use it to protect yourself and your allies from the enemy frontline/assassins."}
{"text": "As vayne, Vayne has a great trading potential but needs a lot of time on scale because of the nature of her kit. The more the game goes, the more likely her chances of bringing her team solo to victory. Level six is a massive point of early play as she can now look for aggressive all-ins on the enemy. It is effortless for Vayne of bamboozle laner enemy now because of its invisibility. She can even use it to avoid the ganks. The first element will certainly give Vayne a massive boost in the duel. She will have to use the track brushes to make sure she can compensate for her short range."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Do not group or fight inside the jungle as it will allow Rumble to get a good Ultimate b off. By fighting in the open, it will be harder for him to get a 5 person Ult b.\n\nNever try to take an objective like Baron or the Dragon if Rumble is alive and kicking. As you will be quite close together inside the pit, you are allowing him to land a devastating b on your whole team.\n\nRumble is prone to disengage. As soon as he uses his Ultimate b, try to disengage or reposition so it\u2019s harder for him to deal follow up damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Consistent poke damage with his W and Q which can allow him to push the enemy laners out of the lane abruptly. This can also allow him to all-in enemies once they are low enough after taking the barrage of poke Ezreal has to offer.\n\nHis Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during the early game to waveclear. This is very helpful when he is trying to clear the wave quickly in order to get a recall.\n\nEzreal\u2019s E allows him to get out of sticky situations with ease and makes him one of the safest ADCs in the game. He can also buffer it in response to CC abilities which will allow him to avoid follow up CC if he manages to get hit by the initial CC ability."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid grouping too closely if the enemy has several knock-ups as this will allow Yasuo to get a very good Ultimate Roff. The grouping but not standing on each other will reduce the effectiveness of his Ultimate R. Do not fight in the jungle because it will be easier for Yasuo to land his Tornado to hit and follow him with his Ultimate R. Fighting outdoors will make the team fight more effective for your team. CC is your best friend in team fighting."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, Another point in his Ultimate y will allow him to use the ability frequently, and he should be able to split push, and secure picks quite often.\n\nAt level 9, he will have maxed his first ability.

If you focus the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}
{"text": "As maokai, Once Maokai gets two points in his Ultimate R, he will use it frequently. If the enemy doesn't put in place a deep vision, they won't have a good time to face the Ultimate R. Maokai is extremely good in team fighting because he can distinguish enemies and CC several enemies with his Ultimate R. His Passive doesn't let him die quickly either. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to do a lot of damage with the ability and allow him to use it frequently."}
{"text": "Against sett, Sett\u2019s laning phase is strong. Expect him to play aggressive and go for early kills. Avoid trading with him at level 1 as he will out damage most champions.\n\nOnce Sett is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his ability to get kills in lane also increases. Watch your positioning and disengage if you\u2019re low as his all-in combo deals a surprising amount of damage.\n\nIn the mid-game, Sett will be difficult to fight unless you\u2019re ahead or have assistance. Avoid fighting him and disengage if he runs at you and tries to fight you."}
{"text": "Against ahri, Ahri is rather weak in the early game. Look to poke and fight her during this time to get a good start from the get-go.\n \nPost-6, Ahri has a lot of chase potential thanks to her Ultimate.\n \nDo not overextend when you\u2019re low as she can easily kill you and set you behind. Once Ahri has completed her first item, she will deal a lot of damage and be able to push the wave/ fight more frequently. Keep this in mind and respect her all-in damage."}
{"text": "As ziggs, His Q is his foremost poke ability, and it is pretty reliable, so adding more points in it will directly boost his overall damage in the lane. It will let him decimate his opposition, primarily when he uses the ability from a brush.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities consistently due to his increased mana pool. It will also increase his overall damage, which will enable him to completely take over the lane as his waveclear is impeccable.\n\nZiggs is relatively weak early on when compared to other ADCs. This is because he is ability reliant than traditional ADCs who are auto-attack reliant. This can cause him to run out of mana quickly and be useless in the lane. To compensate for this, he should use the lane brushes to zone enemies off. It isn't necessary to use the abilities as the threat is enough to keep enemies at bay."}

{"text": "Against malphite, Malphite is at his weakest in the early game. Try to set him behind to delay his next power spike. \n\nOnce Malphite is level 6 and has his Ultimate h, his kill threat in lane increases and he can start being more aggressive. \n\nTeam fights are where Malphite really shines as his Ultimate h is an AOE ability and can knock up multiple people."}
{"text": "As singed, It can deal with constant amounts of damage, which becomes quite heavy during mid-end fighting. Can force the Jungler to pay particular attention to it, relieving pressure from other ways. Probably the only champion who can proxy firm and safely get out of it due to his kit. Its Ultimate n gives him additional statistics that can temporarily allow him to absorb a lot of damage and flat more damage as well. He can act as a front line for his team in this way."}
{"text": "As renekton, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing.

You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}

But once again, staying healthy is the key if you're looking for anything in someone. Once you have your ultimate R, look for an all-in. Fizz has tons of pressure to kill with its ultimate R and it will usually lead to a kill."}
{"text": "As leblanc, After your bot path has moved to the middle lane, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. As you are good at getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around the Rift Invocation alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby goal. When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you keep firm during the middle game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Don't stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done."}
{"text": "As maokai, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping when your Ultimate R is down.\n\nGroup with your team when your Ultimate R is up. Rotate from the side lane to wherever your team is and look for a pick with your Ultimate R.\n\nPeel for your allies in team fights. As you\u2019re a tank, you\u2019re rather weak unless your carries are alive. Thus, keeping them alive is key in team fights. Be prepared to peel for them when necessary. "}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz is strong at level 3 and 4 once he unlocks all 3 of his abilities. He should play somewhat safer until he reaches either 3 or 4 and then look for an aggressive all-in.\n\nFizz\u2019s main power spike is once he hits level 6. His Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool that can help him get kills with ease. It has a short cooldown so he will be able to play aggressively over and over again.\n\nOnce Fizz has recalled and picked up his first item, he\u2019ll be able to dish out of a lot of damage quite quickly. A good Fizz will not be scared to go for aggressive plays especially if he has a better first item than his lane opponent."}
{"text": "Against fizz, By walking around the Rift Invocation, do not go alone if you are squishy. Fizz can easily assassinate someone who walks through the river alone. Take appropriate paths through the monitored areas whenever possible. Do not use execution capabilities or keystrokes on Fizz unless he has used his E as he can easily avoid them by going non-target. If you are hit by the Fizzs Ultimate R, do not walk near your allies because the damage of his shark's AOE inflicts a lot of damage on them too. Walk towards them but do not approach."}
{"text": "As belveth, The late game you become an unstoppable attack speed carry with a crazy amount of mobility, the constant release of damage and also a good survival too. Try your fights around the initiation of your teammates, and always be the follow-up rather than the initiation. You will fight to be removed as long as you are not taken out alone, and use your Qs mobility to avoid as many major CC capabilities as possible in team fights. When among several targets, do not forget to use your E to keep you alive as well as the prioritization of these Coral Void from fallen enemies. The same attention remains on the fight around the goals. If you take a Baron at this point he can easily decide the game with this extended version of True Form you get to consume his Coral Void. Focus on this as much as you can without forcing him with a 50/50."}
{"text": "Against velkoz, Try your hardest to avoid Velakoz Qa. Invest in the boots early if you are in trouble to avoid this ability. As soon as he channels his Ultimate R, either disengage, CC him or engage in the all-in. Hard CC will interrupt his Ultimate R, but the roots do not. After he gets his first article, Velakoz will constantly push the minion wave. Stay close but outside the minion wave at any time so that he is unable to push and poke at the same time."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, At level 6, Mordekaisers kill pressure increases. Every time his Ultimate R is at the top, you have to play more respectfully. Mordekaiser has a strong all-in-all potential as soon as it reaches level 3, but before it can be pushed out of the way. Abuse it as much as possible before it touches level 3. Team fighting is where Mordekaiser can shine. If you are a carrier champion, make sure to invest in a QSS so you can get out of his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As katarina, Try to abuse your range advantage to get an early health advance. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early to force them to lie down for the farm and XP. When you try to poke, target your abilities so they hit the minion wave and the enemy at the same time. Once they are level 6, they get stronger than you and it will be harder for you to run against them."}
{"text": "As ornn, The final point in his Ultimate R will grant him a massive spike, and he will be able to dish out tons of damage to the enemy. Since the ability will be up frequently, he will be able to easily pick off targets with his team.\n\nOrnn is really great during team fights as he can peel for his team and set up picks for them when required. Any dispute near terrain will be favorable for him.\n\nHis tankiness will be phenomenal during this phase of the game. Combined with his deceptive damage, it will become tough to deal with him for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Its is an excellent tool that can allow it to escape the ganks and skirmishes with the enemy during the laning phase. Wukongs Ultimate n is a very good tool. It can be used to help his team win team battles, and for him to get murders during the laning phase. Wukong excels in the prolonged trades with his s and k. He is a very strong duellist in the laning phase."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, Aatrox is strong from the 2-6 levels. Make sure to keep your distance to make it harder for him to land his Q and push you down. Aatrox peaks when he gets his first article (as well as both components). Respect his everything in the potential when he has finished the recipe as his damage production will increase sharply. Aatrox is very important if you can't avoid all the cases of his Q. Practice makes perfect, but try to avoid them every time you are able to."}
{"text": "As neeko, Neeko is pretty weak early, especially if the enemy can see its ability to throw. You will constantly want to use the track brushes and get your Q & E from the enemy inside them. When you try to push the enemies, make sure you don't push the wave into accidentally. This is very important when you deal with enemies who are tanks and rely on you being pushed up in the way. Always try to land your E through enemy minions to increase the power of the ability."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, 3 points in his Ultimate e will not be an excellent peak of power. That's because he only ensures his prolonged survival and nothing else. He will do a lot of damage during the last parts of the game. That's because he will have several elements and will be able to duplicate anyone. His late scale of the game is phenomenal, and he can a-shot squishy enemies after slowing them down and catching them. He will give him a pivotal role in the game."}
{"text": "As sylas, His W can allow him to heal a lot of health in terrible situations. Being a point and a click, it is quite easy to land and can easily change the tide of a fight. The initial casting of his E allows him to move to a certain place. This can allow him to avoid hot skills and also to get on a still or vulnerable port."}
{"text": "As anivia, This matchup is easy early but harder post-6 as Anivia has a lot of wave clear and will just keep pushing you in.\n\nFocus on farming and limit looking for fights. \n\nIf you can, try and aim your abilities so they hit her and the minion wave at the same time. This is especially true post 6 when you want to match her wave clear.\n\nDue to Anivia\u2019s Passive, it is going to be hard for Hwei to get kills early without the help of your Jungler."}
{"text": "As masteryi, When no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. You must continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. The more gold Master Yi has, the stronger he will be.\n\nIf your team gets a kill or two, make the call for Baron or the Dragon. You should be able to take them with ease as Master Yi.\n\nAlways use the fog of war to bamboozle the enemy and destroy the enemy backline that way. It should be really easy to do due to how much damage you can dish out."}
{"text": "As fizz, They\u2019re stronger than you early. Avoid fighting so you do not fall behind.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map so you can protect yourself against their all-ins.\n\nIf they roam, ping and communicate with your team. You cannot match their roams.\n\nAbuse your range by poking with your abilities. Try to auto-attack when you can, but don\u2019t force it."}
{"text": "As ksante, At level 16, you would have put the third and final point in your Ultimate. The additional cooldown reduction will help you get choices with your team. As you have a lot of CC in your kit, you are good in team fights. In the end of the game, you will be regrouping with your team and looking for fights like 5, so you are good at this stage too."}
{"text": "As vi, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing up. Fighting with outside will make the fights of the late game team much harder. Delay fighting and be ready to disengage if it's still on cooldown."}
{"text": "As braum, Braum's first peak power is when it reaches level 3. When it has access to all its basic capabilities, it can start to be more proactive and have some pressure on the track. Until then, it can't exactly do too much. Braums next significant peak power is once it reaches level 6. Braum's Ultimate r unlocking is very important and once it reaches this peak power, it can start actively searching for all the ins with its ADC. When Braum has upgraded its boots, it can start wandering around the map."}
{"text": "As gwen, Don't get too involved in this game or you'll end up dying and giving up free goals to the enemy team. Always try to sneak into the enemy rearline and blow them up. Focus on the closest enemy champion in the team fights. Even with your W, you're always squishy and vulnerable to the enemy rearline. Focus on the same champion your allies are focusing on. You can cut a ton of damage in the team fights at the end of the game with your Q-related damage. Make sure you're self-attacking as much as you can to increase your Q-related damage."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus is very weak early and cannot gank at all until he has many levels under his belt.\n\nWhen he hits level 6, Nasus\u2019 kill pressure increases and he can start to duel the enemy. His survivability against invades will also increase too!\n\nHe can start to gank after level 3/4 depending on when he puts his first point in his W.\n"}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce won't be spiking too hard at level 11 because it won't be giving him as much stats or utility as most other champions' ultimates. It will definitely allow him to increase his overall burst damage, though.\n\nOnce he maxes his s at level nine, he will be able to dish out a lot of damage. This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of war and manages to burst down an unsuspecting squishy enemy with his w > s combo.\n\nJayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at that time. Due to his ranged stance, he can quickly go for short burst trades where Jayce is guaranteed to come out on top if he spaces well."}
{"text": "As shaco, Focus on early farming. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP. However, if you find an opportunity to ganking or counter-ganking nearby, don't be afraid to take it. If they invade you early, just back; you don't win early skirmishes with them."}
{"text": "As elise, It cannot avoid important CC capabilities without this capability and therefore it will have to use it properly to ensure that an all-in is well. Its Q works differently according to its shape. Using the wrong shape at the wrong time can prevent it from being killed while buying valuable time for the enemy to collapse on it. Its blue buff is very important to it. The flight during the early game will prevent it from being able to throw its capabilities frequently, which will eventually allow the enemy Jungler to invade it easily."}
{"text": "As nunu, Very good objective control because of his Q and Smite. It also allows him to heal both in the way and in the Jungle, which gives him an innate advantage against other Junglers. Great potential for glove because of his W, especially if there is no vision set up by the enemy team. This can lead to a large CC chain. Its Ultimate R can allow him to set phenomenal death brushes while contesting objectives. This can allow him to put an end to the game or take the goal quite freely."}
{"text": "Against diana, Diana has a unique playstyle when it comes to farming and trading during the early game. Her s has a strong impact on the wave and she will tend to push the wave with it. Try to engage and fight her when her s is on cooldown.\n \nDiana is dependent on landing her Q for the all-in. Try to back away if she lands it to reduce her chances to follow up with her t and trade.\n \nShe is a melee champion that struggles against ranged champions. When playing as a ranged champion, use your abilities and auto-attacks on her when she moves forward to last hit."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, During this phase of the game, you will want to stay behind your frontline and dish out as much poke damage as you possibly can. Watch your flanks for assassin's trying to take you out quickly.\n\nGetting a defensive item will help you a lot in this game against all-in comps. You will want to make sure that you stay alive to deal a lot of damage, and a Zhonya's will help you a lot when it comes to doing just that.\n\nYour e should be hitting like a truck now as well, so you will have to keep your positioning in mind while dealing damage. Don't throw a game by Flashing forward and out of the protection of your team."}
{"text": "Against nidalee, Nidalee will be quite strong once she has a few points in her s. Her Spears s deal a lot of damage, so make sure you dodge them.\n\nNidalee doesn\u2019t spike as much at level 6 compared to other champions as she already has her Ultimate r at level 1. \n\nOnce she has completed her Jungling item, her damage output will be very good. Avoid fighting her unless you can catch her out of position or if you\u2019re stronger than her."}
{"text": "As pantheon, You will have a lot of presence during this phase of the game. Try to lock high-priority target CC when possible and get rid of them quickly. Work with your Jungler and get some spikes on the enemy Jungler or Support when you get the chance. This will allow you to snowball your lead during the middle of the game. Flanking enemies with your Ultimate R is viable but do it during a fight so that the enemy does not pay much attention to your positioning. Lower the elo, more effective this tactic is."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Group and stay with your team. Go to the hall when you know where the enemy is in order not to be chosen and killed before an objective spawning. Look for choices with your Ultimate e. Nautilus can quickly force goals or team fights with ease if he can catch someone who walks too far forward. Peel and protect your allies as much as possible in mid-game team fights. If you let them die, it will be difficult for your team to win the fight. After engaging, retreat and peel for your ADC."}
{"text": "Against vayne, Vayne will often be left alone to divide the thrust and the farm. While she is away from her team, you could look to collapse on her and bring her down. Do not engage several players to kill her though if she bots and the Baron up. Vayne is subject to CC. Locking up at the beginning of the fight will make incredibly difficult for her to kite, cause damage and win the team battle. Playing around her Ultimate n will be a great way to increase your chances of killing Vayne in a team fight. Force a team to fight one after the other will reduce her chances of surviving in the next."}
{"text": "As camille, Keep roaming around and invading the enemy Jungle regularly. Drop deep wards whenever you get the chance and try to keep track of the enemy Jungler. You should always backup your Jungler while they are busy invading.\n\nLook to flank and take down enemies, or pick them off with your Ultimate. This can be quite easy on the enemy Support, or enemy Mid Lane if they overextend.\n\nPurchase items that will keep you alive for longer in team fights. Try to be as obnoxious as possible: soak and deal damage to get your team ahead.\n"}
{"text": "As jhin, His immobility is his main weakness as he has a large target painted on his head because of this. If the enemy manages to catch him out, he will die.\n\nDue to his Passive, he isn\u2019t really good against tanks, especially the ones who can get on his face. It will take ages for him to get rid of a genuine tank.\n\nThe Ultimate R roots him in place. This allows the enemy to both flank and focus him down with ease. Due to his squishiness, he can\u2019t really survive for too long."}
{"text": "Against yone, Yone is incredibly mobile in the way, but if he uses his E, you can abuse cooldown (after he's returned) to play aggressively and push him down. This will make it harder for him to survive an exchange or come back with you. Avoid running too far when Yone uses his E as he will always return to his original place. Playing as a varied champion, try to use your range advantage to harass and hit him down. Try and stay away although he is unable to reach you very easily."}
{"text": "As taliyah, This is particularly true at the beginning of the game. Her Ultimate R has the probability of having her entire team killed if it is inappropriately used. She is also very vulnerable when her C is broken. The ground engineer on her Q can easily allow her drags to play in the middle of the track as she can continue to block her enemies with continuous Qs."}
{"text": "Against nami, Nami\u2019s poke at level 1 and 2 is pretty deadly. Don\u2019t let her bully you down at level 1 so it\u2019s harder for her to look for the level 2 all-in.\n\nOnce Nami hits level 6, her kill pressure intensifies as her Ultimate R is a great tool to start skirmishes or disengage from fights. Make sure you have vision in your lane as she may use her Ultimate R to set up her Jungler.\n\nNami is very good when she has 1 or more core healing items as she will be able to sustain and heal her allies back to full health quickly. Try to put her behind in the early game to deny these power spikes."}
{"text": "As yuumi, As Yuumi has a lot of built-in support, make sure you get some form of healing reduction quickly to make it easier for you to kill them. Yuumi is a squishy champion. If you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map, you can force them to exceed the extension and then all-in or fight Yuumi when they superextend. Do not let Yuumi harass you and bring you down. If you lose a lot of health, you will never be able to play aggressively. Look at your positioning, Dodge Yuumi damage and don't let you abuse for free. Keep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them (she or the CDA) after they have used a capability as they can't use it to trade with. Yuumi is less of a threat when they have a ability to get down."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Avoid regrouping too closely otherwise, Lissandra will be able to engage with her E and land on a multi-person W. If you can, try to separate slightly so that she can only hit 1 or 2 champions to the maximum. Play around Lissandras Ultimate R cooldown. Once he's on cooldown, she's rather vulnerable and can't fight as a team properly. You can use this to your advantage to force team fights when you know it. Lissandra has tons of clear wave, so the nap targets in the middle and the end of the game will be difficult. Keep this in mind and try to take her down or push her off the track so she can't defend her Turrets."}
{"text": "As malphite, Just hide in the brush of the early track and wait for the enemies to approach. Once they approach, d and run away. Remember that you will not do anything until you touch level 6. Make sure that your health is saved so that you can all enemies as soon as you manage to reach level 6. Getting your Ultimate h will allow you to do much more in the way. Now you can wander and use the brushes of the track to kill the enemy bot track."}
{"text": "Against sylas, If your Ultimate is powerful, then its Ultimate R will be powerful too. The stronger the game Sylas will become. Avoid feeding him at the beginning of the game to reduce his strength in the middle and at the end of the game. After Sylas has finished his first element, he will have more pressure on the way and will seek to play offensive. Up to this point, try to abuse him as much as possible."}
{"text": "As sylas, You are way stronger than Sylas early. Invade him and try to fight him in the 1v1.\n\nMake sure you apply as much pressure as possible by ganking often in the early game.\n\nRemember to take those objectives. Unlike Sylas, you can solo those objectives quite easily.\n\nIf you see Sylas ganking nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to counter gank. You\u2019re a really strong counter-ganker!\n"}
{"text": "As rammus, He is very tanky in the middle of the game and will act as a very powerful front line for his team. Another point in his Ultimate 2 will give him an important boost and allow him to get choices frequently. The team fight is the place where Rammus excels the most. He can quickly chase enemies, and the fights of choking points are his bread and butter."}
{"text": "Against ornn, In team fights, avoid grouping too closely as Ornn can use his Ultimate R to get a multi-person knock up and start the team fight.\n\nOrnn has the ability to knock up enemies that are close to his Q, terrain and walls. Avoid fighting inside the jungle as it will allow him to land an easy knockup. \n\nOrnn will tend to stick in a side lane when no team fights are occurring and when there are no major objectives up. Use the numbers advantage to start a team fight while he is away from his team."}
{"text": "Against senna, Senna will look to dominate you in the early game. Expect her to play aggressively at level 1 to gain a health advantage.\n\nOnce Senna is level 6, her map pressure and kill pressure increases. Ping once she is level 6 so your team knows that she can influence a fight with her Ultimate R.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Senna\u2019s Passive will be. Try to end it as fast as you can as her late game is quite strong if she has been able to stack effectively. "}
{"text": "As velkoz, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning. You need to poke the enemy down and delay fights in the late game, but you need to watch your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not get picked off by trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As renata, At level 3, she will unlock all 3 of her basic abilities. She now becomes a champion and can fight the enemy. \n\nWhen she has completed her first component item, she can empower her allies further and make them a lot stronger in fights and skirmishes.\n\nAt level 6, Renata will be really strong and she can look for more kills and picks. She can also set up her Jungler with ease.\n"}
{"text": "As neeko, A maxed-out Ultimate R will let Neeko use the ability quite frequently. All she needs to do is find a flank on the enemy team.\n\nHer late-game team fighting is really potent. She can disrupt an entire team with a well-placed E or Ultimate R.\n\nHer damage during the late game is absolutely massive. One E > Q combo is enough to half-health any squishy target."}
{"text": "Against amumu, Amumu is quite vulnerable to poke damage. Try to harass him as much as possible to make it almost impossible for him to enter without dying in return. Amumu level 6 is very good. Once he reaches level 6, try and position away from your other laner so he can't both CC with his Ultimate y. Look at your positioning throughout the game. Try and position so always behind 1 minion so it's impossible for him to land his s on you."}
{"text": "As gragas, Level 3 is a massive powerpike for Gragas because it can now look for full-blown all-in on the enemy target. Positioning can cause some hindrance that its E can be interrupted by minions. The use of track brushes or its Flash should quickly solve the problem. Level 6 of Gragas is an important peak of power because it can now move key enemy targets during a gank or all-in. It can allow it to remove the enemy rear line if it decides to go for the full AP construction. Its main prowess will come during the team fighting, however, where it can separate the enemy door and kill them. Gragas' first element will give it a massive boost in the way. However, it depends honestly on the construction it goes as well. If Gragas goes for the construction of the tank, it will survive much longer during the team fighting due to its first element while inflicting reduced damage."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Pantheon can duel almost every Jungler in the game. A good Pantheon will constantly look to invade the enemy and get kills.\n\nPantheon\u2019s level 6 allows him to gank his allies from afar. He can cast his Ultimate R from afar, which means he\u2019ll avoid and dodge shallow wards.\n\nHis W offers him tons of pick pressure throughout the game. Getting the right pick on someone can easily win you the game or the team fight."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie gets her first peak of power when she unlocks her Q and W. The Q mana mechanic allows her to save a lot of mana, while her W gives her the priority of the track due to the potential for wave release. Her biggest peak of power is when she gets her Ultimate R. Now she can easily explode people and go to other ways using her E, after pushing the enemy wave with her W. Her first base element decides when she's going to push the strongest."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is good in team fights thanks to its AOE Ultimate R. Fortifying a fight or combat when Swain is nearby will make it easier for your team to win team fights. Avoid regrouping too closely around the goals or in team fights as it can allow Swain to land a very good multi-person E and start the team fight. Burst and poke is the best way to win a fight against Swain. Try to catch him before a team fight starts."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm's tankiness in this phase of the game will be extremely high. He will be a reliable engager and can easily peel for his team as and when necessary.\n\nLevel sixteen will give Tahm Kench a considerable boost in his damage. He can easily duel enemies, incredibly squishy champions in the side lane.\n\nTahm Kench's abilities will have a really short cooldown on his abilities. This means that he can secure picks with ease on anyone. The poke damage on his Q is quite respectable as well."}
{"text": "As shaco, His early ganks are extremely strong, mainly due to his Summoner Spell choices. The enemy will have to invest in tracking him, else they are in for a world of pain.\n\nLevel 6 is an excellent spike as he can now bamboozle enemies with his clone. It will be challenging for the enemy team to be grouped up now.\n\nThe damage dealt to enemies will form a pivotal spike for Shaco. The first item component will help him with his dueling potential and clear speed. "}
{"text": "As warwick, At level 11, he will have access to his level two Ultimate R. This will allow him to use his Ultimate R more frequently while increasing the healing and damage inflicted with the help of this ability. The first ability will be maximized at level 9. At this time, Warwick will become truly powerful. He will be able to easily support himself while making primary goals or taking part in important battles. Warwick is extremely good at making choices, thanks to his Ultimate R. This helps him make choices of the fog of war that will definitely catch enemies out of the watch."}
{"text": "As shyvana, It can be strong enough or really weak. At level 6, Shyvanaa will unlock its Dragon t form. It really comes online at this stage of the game because it basically gets access to a free escape tool and 3 additional capabilities. When Shyvana has finished her Mythic article, its trading potential in the way increases and it can start looking for frequent trades with the laner enemy."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn is an early game bully and will try to harass and poke you as often as she can. Try and stay outside of her auto-attack range and be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP so you don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nOnce Quinn hits level 6, her kill pressure in a trade doesn\u2019t exactly increase as her Ultimate R is a utility tool. However, her ability to roam does. If she leaves lane, ping your teammates so they know that she is missing.\n\nKeeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game will allow you to get gold and XP without fear of Quinn zoning you away and denying you farm. Post 6, you shouldn\u2019t be freezing as it will give Quinn an opportunity to roam. "}
{"text": "Against maokai, Maokai is good in team fights because his Ultimate R has a great zone of effect. Make sure to separate or disengage as soon as you see it so he is unable to use this ability. Maokai is good at level 2 starting from that he can lock you with his W. Make sure to get level 2 as quickly as possible to deny him level 2 all-in. Once Maokai has his E, he can place his Saplogs E in nearby bushes and area you away from them. Make sure you stay opposite the track so that the Saplogs E can not damage you."}
{"text": "As zilean, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game.

Do not get picked off by trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As khazix, Once he has obtained two points in his Ultimate R at level 11, his ability to assassinate his targets and escape unharmed will increase considerably. As long as he uses his abilities correctly, he will have an effortless time to resume the game. Kha'Zix Q is his main damage capability that will be maximized at level 9. He can practically squishes at a shot at this point, especially if they are isolated. He will also allow him to clean Jungle camps quite quickly."}
{"text": "As twitch, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will dramatically increase his damage and leave his squishies at one stroke if they take many automatic attacks from Twitch. Once he has 2 points in his Ultimate c, he will easily be able to resume team fighting and disrupt them as well. His positioning will be very important."}
{"text": "As leona, They will not be able to go into the enemy at all if their ADC constantly pushes the wave in the beginning of the game. Can easily be overturned by various champions in the way. Watching your positioning is the key when you play like this champion. Must commit to all in. If you go, you will be in an extended position that could allow the enemy to turn the exchange and kill you."}
{"text": "As zed, Look at CC when possible. It's his life swing and will allow you to win the game easily. Make sure to apply as much pressure as you can early by appearing his inflation power and trying to inflate as often as possible. Place the pupils all around the card when possible in this matchup. It will allow you to detect Zed and know where he is."}
{"text": "As sylas, His ultimate R is completely dependent on the comp enemy team. If the enemy has ultimate lacklust, Sylas will not be able to do much. If he is misused, his W can have him killed because of his move to another place. If the enemy buys Grieve Injuries, they can easily counter this healing with a good amount."}
{"text": "As ornn, He is quite weak before six because of his over-telegraphed capabilities. He will need to use the track brushes and trade when the enemy gets too close to him or to the ground. His level six is a massive power peak because he can now impact the team fights regularly. He will also have him killed solo in the track. The first element will increase his survival and damage in the track. This is very useful because he will not even have to remember if he manages to preserve his health."}
{"text": "Against warwick, Warwick's biggest power peak is when it reaches level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate R. If you are at risk of dying, be ready for Flash as soon as it appears in your way. It falls into the game late but that does not mean it is useless. A good Ultimate R on a key target is enough to win the game. Investing in a QSS will offer you some protection. Warwick can solo goals in the game early game with ease. If there are no gank opportunities for him, he could try to take the Dragon instead."}
{"text": "As kaisa, At level 9, her Q will be fully maximized and will inflict a lot of damage to her enemies. This will allow her to take the game in hand with ease. Depending on the construction for which she is going, she will get her first capacity upgrade during this stage of the game. It will be a massive power peak and will let her be the first port for her team. Kai'sa is really good in fighting due to her E and Q. She can peel and use her Ultimate R for both aggressive and defensive purposes."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Once Neeko reaches level 6, her death pressure increases. During her struggle, keep in mind that she can throw her Ultimate R and inflict damage and CC you. When Neeko finished her first element, she will have tons of free wave and will be able to push the wave very quickly. You will need to make sure that you can push the wave so that you don't lose your turn early. Neeko is good in team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Disengage as soon as you see her channel her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Poke the enemy and harass them as much as you can before trying to fight. Bursting someone with some Q.S. and your R will allow you to force a team fight with numbers or health advantage. Avoid using your E aggressively in the end-of-game fights that you will be vulnerable briefly. Use it only aggressively if you are 100% sure you can not be abused for it. Stick with your team and avoid walking too far from them. If you are caught out, your team will lose on a lot of damage in a team fight, and that would be your fault."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Your Q will hit like a truck now, and your W will allow you to heal a lot of allies at the same time. Overall, you'll help your team a lot during the fights. Since your Ultimate R will be on a short cooldown, use it as much as you can, and don't fight without. Otherwise, you'll miss a lot of damage and CC to kill enemies. Neutral Goal fights should be your bread and butter. The fights are pretty crowded, and you can easily afflict several targets."}
{"text": "Against diana, Diana\u2019s core power spike is once she hits level 6 because she will have crowd control on her Ultimate R. At this time, she will be looking to gank and will be continuing to gank whenever it\u2019s available.\n \nAfter Diana has completed her first item, her skirmishing potential and damage output will heavily increase. She will be a real threat at this stage of the game.\n \nThe more kills she gets the stronger she becomes. Try and counter gank as she has nothing to offer once she has blown her Ultimate R or Q. "}
{"text": "As rumble, Get to level 3 quickly and see if you can overheard gank enemies regularly. Your e and d will come in extremely convenient when ganking to make sure that you use them carefully. Always try to keep your resource bar half filled. It will allow you to inflict more damage during the ganks and clearings that can come in extremely convenient in early play. Once you hit level 6, you should be able to increase the frequency and efficiency of your ganks. Make sure that you do nothing that gets you caught during early play."}
{"text": "As thresh, Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. So your goal during the laning phase is to look for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As elise, Focus on securing the goals. Elise can do them alone or with his team. Secure each Dragon if possible. Look for choices with your E. Elise is really good to choose champions and catch them out of position with that ability. If you can catch someone, call for a close goal. Continue picking up the farm and secure your jungle camps. Getting gold in your pockets will make you a higher threat in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As volibear, It is countered by Grievous Wounds because it prevents him from healing by many, thus reducing his diving tower and all-in-potential. Dispersing in a team fight will prevent him from getting a massive final R, and changing the tide of a team fight. His trading power is weaker when his ultimate R is on the cooldown. His main goal is to get an early lead by constantly gaunting."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, Be careful when going for short trades with Qiyana as she prefers them over long extended ones.\n\nWhen Qiyana has her River Element (the blue one), do not overextend or play super aggressively. There is probably a reason she has picked this up and her Jungler may be nearby. Play safer when she holds this Element.\n\nPre-6, Qiyana will constantly push the minion wave with her Q. Stand outside of the minion wave at all times so she is unable to push and poke at the same time. But, do not stand near a wall so she cannot Ult R you into it. "}
{"text": "Against rengar, Rengar will try to cheese at level 1. Do not walk in the track unless it is spotted too wisely, it will jump on you from a bush. It is really good after the laning phase has finished because it can get peaks with its Ultimate R. Avoid walking around Rift Invocators alone otherwise it can try to catch you out of position. Standing down the track at any time will facilitate laning against Rengar. Avoid standing near the bushes as it will be able to jump out of them."}
{"text": "Against diana, During the team fights, Diana's kit offers a lot of bursting damage thanks to her Ultimate R. Try to bring her down before she engages to make it really difficult for her to engage and kill anyone. Diana's engagement is beautifully scripted. Ward on the side during a nap of a goal so she can't surprise your team with an all-in. Diana is a murderer and can quite easily a-shot any squishy target walking alone across the river. Do not enter the river unless you've kept it or know where Diana is."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Try to finish the game as fast as you can as long as the game goes, the stronger Kayle becomes. Kayle will tend to be split pushing during the middle of the game. You can use this time to force a team to fight with the advantage of numbers as she pushes into a side track. Kayle is rather vulnerable when her Ultimate R is on cooldown. Try to force the fights and kill her while her Ultimate R is on the ground."}
{"text": "As lillia, As Lillia is usually built AP, it will fight against teams that have significant damage. It also fights against poke and disengagement, which can make team fighting difficult for it. Although its Ultimate R is an excellent team fighting tool, it takes time to enter into force. Your allies can also disrupt your damage if they inflict damage to a sleeping target."}
{"text": "Against twitch, Don't hang on or stay tight in the team fights against Twitch while her Spray and Pray c will melt you. Spread out and look for a way to blow it up once it turns out. Twitch will often get close to your team after coming out of its s. Once he has left it, try to shoot it as quickly as you can."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Once Fiddlesticks has his Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass, it allows his R to really hit home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonya\u2019s, you can\u2019t attack him when he goes into stasis.\n \nWhen Fiddlesticks gets access to 3 abilities, he is really difficult to deal with because they offer him so much utility. If you\u2019re trying to go for an all in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing.\n \nOf course, Fiddlesticks biggest power spike is his level 6. You can counter it by having constant wards around your lane. If he goes missing post 6, ping your teammates."}
{"text": "As akshan, At level 9, Akshan will maximize his Q. It's really important for Akshan as maxing his Q offers him a lot of extra damage. When Akshan puts the second point in his Ultimate at level 11, he will find it pretty easy to execute enemies. At this stage of the game, the teams will be grouped. Akshans w will be really good at this stage of the game because he can bring back a recently deceased ally."}
{"text": "Against drmundo, Dr. Mundo has a lot of support thanks to his Passive and the items he picks up. Make sure to invest in the Execute of the Appeal or another element that inflects serious wounds to reduce his healing. In the team fights, Ignite will help reduce his healing, so make sure to Ignite him as soon as he engages. Control of the crowd is your best friend against Dr. Mundo. If you can have CC on him in a team fight, it will be very difficult for him to activate his Ultimate R and avoid damage."}
{"text": "Against amumu, Amumu\u2019s team fight presence is very strong. Do not group too closely as this will allow him to get a multiperson entangle with his Ultimate y. Do not fight inside the jungle either for the same reason.\n\nTry and start a team fight as soon as the one before has ended. Fighting when Amumu isn\u2019t there or when his Ultimate y is on cooldown is a surefire way of winning the next fight.\n\nSpreading out the map and split pushing is your best bet as a 5v5 team fight against a team with Amumu doesn't usually end well. However, if you\u2019re teammates are squishy and prone to get caught out, you\u2019ll need to group."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Stay grouped with your team at all times in the mid-game. If you\u2019re alone, you will be an easy target for the enemy team.\n\nPlay safe and avoid getting too cocky if you\u2019re not ahead. If you get caught out in the mid-game when Baron is up, the enemy will be able to take it for free. Only play aggressive if your allies are nearby and ready to help you.\n\nStay with your Support at all times. Like we suggested, it\u2019s important that you\u2019re always with your Support in the mid-game otherwise you\u2019ll be an easy target."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen will have three points in his Ultimate R at level 16, which will give him a massive increase in damage and the luxury of using capacity frequently. Of course, this helps a lot when he manages to catch an out-of-guard enemy. His tankness is overcharged during the late part due to all his articles. However, he will not die much and can easily delimit the enemy of his team, especially if the enemy team has a murderer who likes to dive the allied backline. Garen will have a lot of articles now, which will give him both a blow of damage and survival in the way."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Kog. Maw is rather weak in the early game. Play safely and avoid fighting until you have some levels under your belt. Avoid fighting in the early game. Instead of focusing on agriculture and winning as much gold and XP as possible. Once you have some levels behind you, you can start fighting. Once you have destroyed the lower lane tower, turn to the middle lane and try to take this tower down to open the map."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level 3 is a decent powerpike because Heimerdinger will have access to all its capabilities. It can easily ADC still CC and explode them with its turrets and rockets. It can also use the track brushes to catch enemies out of sight with its W or E. Level 6 is probably a massive power peak for Heimerdinger. It can now bait enemies to their death with ease. It can also take laps very quickly or slow several enemies with its E. The first mythical element will allow Heimerdinger to deposit a ton of damage of poke in the track with its turrets. Its burst damage will also be quite powerful, and it can a-shot enemies with the greatest ease."}
{"text": "As aphelios, Focus on early farming so you can get your first item as soon as possible. Save your Severum ammo if you can as the r will be useful for trading in the way if your Support triggers a fight. You can play around your Support/Jungler and set for them with your Gravitum r. At no time, if you get too close to the enemy (even if they are CC'd). When it is equipped with the Infernum, you will become a gank target because you will automatically push the wave. Do your best not to let this happen and ask the Support to clear the wave evenly so that you can grow properly."}
{"text": "Against tristana, If Tristana uses her W aggressively, burst her down or CC her so she is unable to reposition and clean up the fight. Taking her down early will make it really difficult for her team to win the fight.\n\nIn the mid-game, if Tristana is ahead, avoid walking too far forward if you\u2019re alone. She has great all-in and pick thanks to her W and E. Keep at an appropriate distance away from her so she cannot easily take you down.\n\nTristana has a lot of self peel with her W and Ultimate R. To make fighting easier, try to play around her Ultimate R or look to flank her in team fights. This will make it harder for her to kite/escape the fight."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Several elements during this phase of the game will allow him to effectively fight enemies. His damage will be quite significant now. Another point in his Ultimate R will make him have a lot of potential to pick. He can easily hide around the map and 1 v 1 squishy targets. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. He will grant him increased damage and survival, and now he will be a massive threat to the enemy team."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is really easy to kit. As he is still, champions with dashes, range advantage or poke make it difficult for Darius to get on and kill them. He falls at the end of the game. Darius is a starting champion in the middle of the game and once he arrives at the later stages of the game, his strengths become weaknesses. His Ultimate e is crucial in team fights to remove key targets. If he misses his Ultimate e, his release of damage will be greatly reduced and he could cost him the team fight. That's why he has to throw his Ultimate e as soon as the enemy enters the range of health."}
{"text": "As galio, Use the lane brushes to hide and poke the enemy with your Q every chance you get. Staying out of vision will allow you to easily all-in the enemy with your E and W.\n\nSince you're a protective champion, you will want to be the first to respond to fights around the map, especially in the bot side river. For that, ensure that you have the wave slightly pushed up so that you can respond in time.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should have your eyes glued to the map during skirmishes. Look for champion icons overlapping and see if you can help your allies.        "}
{"text": "As alistar, In the middle of the game, the teams will start to regroup. It's good for Alistar because it will allow him to get a multi-person knock-up with his t>e combo. In the middle of the game, Alistar's abilities will be on shorter cooldowns. This can allow him to go for more choice and increase his team's lead. In addition to the cooldowns below, Alistar would have bought items that make him incredibly tanky. It's good for Alistar because he will be able to take more damage and survive the fights."}
{"text": "As ezreal, The sooner you get it, the better. Harass and poke the enemy as often as you can with your Q. Slowly whipping the enemy with your Q will increase your chances of winning a follow-up fight. Back early once you have enough gold for your first item. Usually Ezreal will want to remember once he has enough gold for Tear."}
{"text": "As sett, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make it easier to access the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}
{"text": "As ryze, Can dish out a lot of burst damage while moving around quickly during team fights. This makes it very hard to catch him and kill him in a team fight.\n\nGreat objective control due to his Ultimate R. It can allow him to transition from a Dragon to Baron almost immediately. He can also pull backdoors off with this ability.\n\nThe CC on his W allows him to set plays for both himself and his team. This can be really effective if he manages to CC a high priority target, and get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Kog'Maw will have several objects during this phase of the game. This will give him a lot of damage to the enemies and will simply crush the enemy rear line during a fight. Kog'Maw is very squishy and can be killed quickly in the end of the game by assassins or enemies with tons of CC. He will have to rely on his team to help him survive. Getting 3 points in his Ultimate will amplify the damage of poke inflicted by the ability. It will be his important ability to treat the damage that should hit like a truck at this stage."}
{"text": "As renekton, Once Renekton gets two points in his Ultimate t, he will be able to run the enemies with ease. The best effect will be seen during the fights around the bottlenecks, however, as the enemies won't be able to escape easily. Renekton will have several articles now. This means that he will be inflicting a lot of damage to his enemies while simultaneously tanting a lot of damage. Any enemy who gets caught by him will undo himself and probably die. Renekton is decent in the middle of the game, but he should focus on the end of the game during this phase of the game itself. Taking as many team fights as possible and getting rid of the enemy rear line is his condition of victory."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Whenever Blitzcrank\u2019s b is on cooldown, he has very little lane pressure and is quite vulnerable. Only use your b if you\u2019re certain you\u2019re going to land it.\n\nBlitzcrank has strong roaming potential, but it\u2019s important that you do not leave your ADC alone if they\u2019re going to die. Communication is key when you wish to roam on Blitzcrank.\n\nSimilarly to his b cooldown, whenever Blitzcrank is low on mana, he has minimal threat as he will be unable to use his basic combo. Ensure you always have enough mana to use both your b and t at any given moment."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressively and looking for aggressive games. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. When you hit level 6, ask for the help of your Jungler to kill the enemy lantern. Ask for help or watch to wander every time your Ultimate R is up. Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be fighting unless you have a clear advantage early."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Once Kai'Sa has obtained three points in her Ultimate R, she will have a massive shield and will be able to reposition herself instantly if things go wrong during the fights. She will have a lot of enhanced capabilities during this phase of the game. This means that her damage output, as well as her defensive capacity, will be really high. At level 13, she will have two fully maximized capabilities. This means that her damage output with her Q, and her peeling potential with her E will be massive."}
{"text": "Against trundle, When Trundle activates his Subjugate n, back away immediately. He will become much tankier and your tanks will be weak. Re-engage when his Subjugate n has cooled off.\n\nAs Trundle will be split pushing a lot in the later stages of the game, try to team fight when he is not able to be there. If you spot him isolated and away from his team, try and force a team fight with his allies.\n\nAs soon as Trundle engages in a team fight, try to lock him down with CC. While he is a tank, he is very vulnerable to hard crowd control."}
{"text": "As graves, You will be able to blow up the enemies due to your entire construction during this phase of the game. Just make sure that you don't get caught because you are squishy and killed if CC'd during this phase. Getting a defensive element should benefit you a lot. It goes against your squishiness and will allow you to make more aggressive games overall. Make it a point to use the fog of the war and get free murders on the enemy whenever possible."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Look at your positioning in the team fights that Morgana will try to catch someone with her Q. Make sure you are in an appropriate position so you can avoid. Do not stay too far forward or too far back. Once Morgana has gone fishing with her Q, she is relatively defenseless on which you can capitalize. As soon as she uses her Q, load her and try to get her off. Every time Morgana throws her Ultimate R in a team fight, try to get out of the area as fast as you can to not be chained and CC."}
{"text": "As orianna, The first item component will allow her to deal more damage and spam her abilities due to the increased mana.\n\nLevel six is a massive spike due to her getting her hands on her Ultimate d. This will let her make plays of her own or in combination with her team.\n\nShe isn't really great pre-six as she can easily be caught out and killed. Post-six is a different story, and the Ultimate d can ultimately tip the balance of a fight.        "}
{"text": "As sona, 2 points in her Ultimate R will let her help her team pick off-targets. Other than that, she can also use it defensively to escape from unfavorable situations.\n\nHer mid-game presence is strong as she dishes out a lot of damage and can quickly heal up her team. The movement speed increase is pretty lovely too.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level nine, allowing her to deal out much damage. It will also increase the damage of her allies' attacks if they happen to be in the ability's aura.        "}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus will have a massive amount of piles during this phase of the game. This can easily allow him to carry a single enemy blow that are relaxed by the enemy team. Nasus' tankness will be a strength to count with as he won't die as long as he finds a target to use his Q on. This will provide his team with a reliable front lining. His main power point is during this phase of the game, as he will have several items, multiple piles, and will be able to go openly all-in and choose enemy champions out of his will."}
{"text": "As kennen, Once Kennen has multiple items, he will be able to single-handedly turn the game's tide. His poke damage will be enough to two-shot squishy carries.\n\nWhen his Ultimate m gets maxed out, he will be dishing out a truckload of damage. Now Kennen will just have to rely on flanks and the fog of war to set up a good fight.\n\nLate game team fights are often decided in the neutral objective pits while taking an objective. Kennen's Ultimate m will come in very handy during this stage and let him win his team's game."}
{"text": "As hwei, However, a disadvantage to him having a lot of abilities is that it can make him quite complicated and overwhelming for players.\n\nHe also has a lot of combos in his kit, which makes him quite difficult to master. He is a challenging champion for beginners to learn from.\n\nWhen he is behind, he isn\u2019t that good. While he does have AOE and a lot of damage, he does nothing in fights when behind.\n"}
{"text": "As fiora, Look for constant skirmishes with the enemy to gain a health or kill lead.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will allow you to chase and all-in the enemy when they walk up to farm with your Q.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, use your strength to fight the enemy and go for a kill. Your Ultimate R is a great duelling tool and can help you get a lead in lane."}
{"text": "As rakan, Get level 2 first and look for a favourable trade. Gaining an early health lead is key to getting a kill later on down the line. Level 2 in the bottom lane is the first minion wave followed by the next 3 melee minions.\n\nYour goal during the laning phase is to look for kills and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to gain a lead.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Ezreal's E is very versatile and can allow it to go to aggressive games or escape sticky situations. It is a very safe support. Its ultimate R is on a short cooldown and can be used frequently during trading with the enemy. It is also global that allows it to sniper people across the map. Ezreal has constant poke damage with its W and Q that can allow it to push enemy loans out of the way abruptly. This can also allow it from all enemies once they are low enough after taking the Poke Ezreal dam has to offer."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level 16 will be a massive peak as it will reduce the cooling of its Ultimate t and increase the damage of its mushrooms. Enemies will have a hard time crossing bottlenecks now. It will have a fairly large amount of Hast capacity now, which means that it can deposit a lot more mushrooms around the map. Enemies will have to invest massively in the vision to keep themselves safe. It will complete its construction during this phase of the game, which will allow it to pull a squishy target. Its store should come in practice during this phase of the game as well."}
{"text": "Against talon, When teams come together, make sure to keep your flanks to spot Talon before he can jump over the wall and assassinate your team. As soon as Talon engages, try your hardest to break it out before he is able to disengage and do a lot of damage. Since Talon is a murderer, expect him to look for peaks with his Ultimate R. Avoid walking around the Rift of Invocators alone. Do not walk in the non-paid areas of the map if you know that Talon is nearby."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, As soon as Mordekaiser activates his W, disengage as he will block the damage you deal to him if you continue to fight him.\n\nMordekaiser is quite immobile. If you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map, you will force him to overextend for farm. You can then capitalise on this and get assistance from your Jungler.\n\nOnce Mordekaiser hits level 6, his kill pressure in lane grows. Keep this in mind and be wary with your positioning when low as he may try and catch you out with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Make sure there's always a minion between you and Pyke at any time so it's harder for him to land his Q. Pyke will try to push the wave as soon as possible so he can get a quick return and get his first article. Harass and get him down so he has to remember before he can get enough gold for Dirk. Pyke is a great traveling champion. Once he gets mobility boots, expect him to wander frequently. Ping every time he leaves the road so your teammates know he's missing. Try to match his push power so you don't lose your turn if he's wandering."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine has low base stats and is pretty vulnerable in the early game. Play safe and avoid taking damage to increase your survivability.\n\nSeraphine lacks an escape tool. This reduces her chances of dodging skill shots and makes it harder for her to escape an all-in from the enemy.\n\nThe shield and heal you get from your W is pretty lackluster, especially in the early game. Do not rely on it to save you or your ADC\u2019s life."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Focus on safe play and keep your ADC alive as long as possible in the way. Your early play is weak and you need time to come online. As you are a melee support, monitor your positioning at all times so that you are not harassed by the enemy Support if they are understood."}
{"text": "Against viktor, Viktor first power peak is once it has reached level 6. Its Ultimate m will give it an additional death pressure in the track and it will start playing a little more aggressive. Its capabilities will be stronger with each upgrade. Once Viktor has finished its first element, and improved its y, it will be able to release the minion waves very quickly and keep you pushed under your turn."}
{"text": "As riven, Riven will begin to fall as the game continues, so she will have to accumulate an early lead on. She should rely on peaks to win the game. She will have a lot of articles during this phase of the game, which will let her dry a lot of damage if she manages to catch an enemy. Level 16 is a massive power peak, which means that she can completely decimate the enemies that are joined together. She will have to find flanks on the enemy frequently."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Locking Taliyah down in the lane will make it much easier for you to kill her. Try to focus her first as she is super squishy and easy to kill when she is CC\u2019d.\n\nWhen trading with Taliyah, stand behind minions so they block her Q damage. But, be on the lookout for her C.\n\nAt level 6, her kill pressure increases, but she cannot use her Ultimate R mid-fight. You should have the level 6 advantage if you have a combat Ultimate.\n"}
{"text": "As nilah, Level 11 is a good power spike for Nilah. Nilah will put a second point in her Ultimate at level 11.\n\nTeams start grouping in the mid-game. Nilah is good in team fights and will be good during the mid-game.\n\nAt level 9, Nilah will max out her first ability.\n"}
{"text": "As tryndamere, You really don't have to panic unless it succeeds in slowing you down, when you can just go away. Keep flipping on its health bar with your Q in this matchup. This is the only sure way to keep you safe in this matchup and prevent Trynd from chaining you regularly. Post Six, you can easily chain CC Trynd with your ult so that he can't use his ult. Just make sure you do it in yourself when it's around 20% HP, and then follow it with your Dash CC. If your team is near you, Trynd will die in a jiffy. Keep the wave somewhere near your turn in this matchup. This will give you many opportunities to bring the enemy under the risk of your Jungler/laners ganks."}
{"text": "As trundle, Trundle is decent enough during the late part because it will have its articles and will be very tanky. Its damage production should be quite high as well. A maximum of Ultimate n will allow Trundle to take control of the fighting in an easy way. It can quickly become tankier or inflict more damage depending on the enemy it uses the Ultimate n on. Trundle is perfect during the team fights. It will allow him to quickly blow up squishy enemies and slow their escape/advances. His e et e should help his team and him a lot."}
{"text": "As riven, Another point in her Ultimate e will increase her damage significantly. All she needs is to time her e well and use her r to CC multiple targets.\n\nShe will now have her core items which means that she will be dealing a lot of damage. She should have an easy time melting through enemy health bars if she manages to catch them off-guard.\n\nRiven's presence during mid-game fights is really fabulous. She should be able to win multiple fights and zone enemies off easily by using her Ultimate e.        "}
{"text": "As sona, Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone, so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nYour damage will be pretty severe to deal with for the enemy team. Make sure you position yourself well and do not get caught out of nowhere or assassinated by assassins.\n\nDo not hesitate to use your Ultimate R. This is mainly because it will be on a short cooldown, and your Ultimate R will be up frequently."}
{"text": "As yorick, This power is increased when his Ultimate R is available for him. Yorick's basic abilities can be really unpleasant for the enemy in the way, especially when he is against a mingle match. He can use this power to further increase his thrust/catch potential, and secure a gold lead on his laner. His Ultimate R can be freed from a track to push this way in his place. This can put the enemy team in a mess, because both Yorick and his young girl can push two different tracks simultaneously."}
{"text": "Against poppy, The longer the game goes, the tankier Poppy will become. Try and reduce her gold income by stealing away her camps during the early game. This will also delay some of her other power spikes.\n\nDepending on her build path, Poppy\u2019s power spikes will change as her AD build and tank build have different power spikes.\n\nOnce Poppy hits level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, she will have a lot more utility and be able able to disengage from a skirmish. "}
{"text": "As ahri, At level 2, Ahri will have access to both Q and E. Once she reaches this level, she can look for a favorable trade. As soon as Ahri reaches level 6, her pressure to kill and choose potential increases. You can look for killers with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends. Once you have recalled and recovered your first element, your Q and clear wave damage will increase considerably. You will be able to push the enemy in their turn with ease once you have this article."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, When no team fights are occurring, move to a side lane and focus on farming and earning XP and gold.\n\nIn team fights, try to flank the enemy. This will increase your chances of getting a good Ultimate R off.\n\nLook for fights inside tight spots of the map or get picks with your Ultimate R. CC\u2019ing a key target will make fighting so much easier."}
{"text": "As rammus, This is a tank versus tank matchup. Your best bet is to just avoid them and focus on farming early.\n\nHowever, they are a stronger ganker than you in the early game, so be prepared to counter-gank and track them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get a lead from easy ganks, try to invade their jungle and steal away their camps.\n\nPost 6, look to make plays and gank your allies whenever your Ultimate is up. It heavily increases your kill pressure.\n"}
{"text": "As talon, Get to level 3 quickly, and make sure to use your E to catch out-of-guard enemies. You should have a considerably easy time dealing with pushed enemies. Early murders should come quite easily to you. Focus the enemy bot and mid-lane as they have the most squishiest targets and will allow you to hard snowball. Your ultimate R should allow you to do a lot of games all around the map. You can even use it defensively if things go wrong."}
{"text": "As darius, When there is no team fight, look to divide the thrust and try to fight the enemy who is trying to stop you. Darius is a strong 1v1 champion and can fight most of the sledgers who are put up against him. Look to use your Ultimate e at the last possible second of each fight. Resetting to your Ultimate e will increase your chances of winning the fight. When you fight team, look to peel out and focus the nearest enemy champion. You are Darius, not a murderer and you will fight to kill anyone alone."}
{"text": "As vayne, Go for regular short trades with your e > auto-attack in this lane. You may want to use the lane brushes quite liberally for this purpose.\n\nYour n will be your best friend in the lane if you're dealing with a tank early on. Ensure that you save it from getting the enemy away from you if they manage to land their CC on you.\n\nGetting your Ultimate n will help you a lot and will allow you to mince through tanks quite easily. Just ensure that your positioning is correct.        "}
{"text": "Against darius, Darius is really strong once he has time to apply multiple stacks of his Passive onto an enemy champion. Do not let him do this by staying out of melee range and avoiding extended trades.\n\nDarius is very strong at level 6 as his Ultimate e is an execute. Do not fight him post 6 unless his Ultimate e is down.\n\nDarius can start to gank as soon as he hits level 2. Keep an eye out as he may try to pull off a cheesy early gank.\n"}
{"text": "As karthus, Powerfarm in the mid-game. You need to earn as much gold and XP as possible so you can level up quickly.\n\nTry to secure objectives like the Baron and Dragon. Karthus can take objectives fast thanks to his 1 and e.\n\nLook for picks with your n and your Ultimate e. Catching someone out with your n is a great way of getting the numbers advantage while you can use your Ultimate e to pick off low health enemies."}
{"text": "As seraphine, The second point of his Ultimate R will allow him to inflict increased damage to the enemies while using it frequently. It will allow him to get far too many peaks in the middle of the game. His mid-game is solid. It will be difficult to catch him, and his CC and AoE damage will allow him to easily exceed the damage cards. The first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to inflict a lot of damage in the fights where the enemy team is grouped or afflicted by his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As jax, After the laning phase has ended, go to another way (or stay up) and just divide the thrust. You are a good split pusher and can draw a lot of attention to your path. If someone tries to challenge your split push, look to fight them. Jax is a good duelist and will be able to fight most of the enemies who are trying to stop it. While you are a champion who is usually sent to divide the thrust, you might need to group with your team if the enemy tries to force something. Be ready to turn around the map and help them fight."}
{"text": "Against azir, Once Azir has taken his Nashor Dent, he will push the wave very quickly. Try to keep the wave as well as possible by matching his damage on the minion wave. If he uses a capability, you will need to use one too. The best time to fight Azir is when the W soldiers are down. That's because he will lack a lot of damage. Try to start fighting every time he doesn't have W soldiers available. After Azir touches level 6, he will have much more protection and can easily disengage thanks to his Ultimate R. While his Ultimate R is down, try to abuse cooldown and look for killers."}
{"text": "As swain, His tankiness and damage are really high during this phase of the game. He can also use his Zhonya's Hourglass to be untargetable for a while dealing damage all the time.\n\nA maxed-out Ultimate R will let him survive fights with ease. The damage will be pretty devastating for the enemy team as well.\n\nSwain's late game is solid due to his team fighting prowess. He can instantly kill the enemy team if he manages to catch them out near a choke point."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, Do not fight Miss Fortune and her team inside the jungle as her Ultimate e will cover the entire pathway which will allow her to deal tons of damage to your whole team.\n\nAs soon as Miss Fortune channels her Ultimate e, try to cancel it by CC\u2019ing her. If you can cancel it quickly, her damage output will be very low.\n\nDo not group to close together as Miss Fortune will be able to hit your whole team with her Ultimate e. Splitting up isn\u2019t a bad idea when trying to team fight."}
{"text": "As milio, Putting the last skill point in your Ultimate at level 16 is a good power peak for you. Your Ultimate will be on its lowest cooldown and will be vital to help your team win team fights. The teams will be grouped in the late part, so you will really shine at this stage of the game. In the late part, you will have several finished elements that is the key. Your healing and survival should be quite high in the late part."}
{"text": "As nautilus, On getting 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will use the ability quite often. Team fights will be a breeze for him from now on.\n\nHis ability to make the team fights unfair due to his pick potential will be quite apparent during this game phase. All he needs to do is Ultimate e his enemy from out of vision.\n\nHis tankiness will know no bounds during this phase of the game. He will soak up both tower shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow up on his engagement."}
{"text": "As morgana, Aim your abilities so they hit both ziggs and the minion wave at the same time.\n\nStand outside of the wave so he cant push adn poke you at the same time.\n\nHis level 6 is stronger than yours. Keep this in mind when fighting early on.\n\nThis is a farming matchup. But you can get kills if you harass and bully him down first while looking for opportunities to hit him with your Q.\n"}
{"text": "As singed, His tankness will be really high during this phase of the game due to his articles. This combined with his Ultimate n will make him almost inchaseable and indestructible at the same time. A completely exhausted maximum Ultimate n will further strengthen his survival and the overall damage inflicted in the long term. It will be a massive peak of power for him. He is excellent during the team fights at the end of the game due to his l and Ultimate n. Its efficiency increases if he manages to find a flank on his enemies."}
{"text": "As azir, When you hit level 6, more opportunities open up to you. For example, you can look for aggressive games or use your Ultimate R defensively. Your Ultimate R is a truly diversified tool that can help you win an advance or prevent you from losing one. After you have taken your first component element, your poke r and damage will increase considerably. Do not be afraid to look for fights once you have taken your first element."}
{"text": "As malphite, Divide the thrust in the middle of the game and try to secure the secondary goals. Avoid regrouping when your **Ultimate** is down. Team up with your team when your **Ultimate** is up. Turn from the side lane to where your team is and look for a choice with your **Ultimate**. Peel for your allies in team fights. As you are a tank, you are rather weak unless your carts are alive. So keeping them alive is the key in team fights. Be ready to peel for them when needed."}
{"text": "As ahri, Ahri is quite vulnerable when her Ultimate is down. Play safer and avoid committing aggressive plays while it is on cooldown.\n\nAhri has multiple skill shots which makes her somewhat harder than many champions. Additionally, her E hitbox isn\u2019t the biggest, so it can be difficult to land.\n\nAhri can be difficult to play into team compositions with heavy CC. While she does have tools to help her dodge these abilities, she will be limited on how and when she can use her Ultimate. For example, she may have to wait for the enemy to use their CC tool before using her E aggressively."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Another point in his Ultimate a will allows him to take more fights around the map. His presence will be felt around the map, and the enemy will have difficulty pushing up. He is quite solid during the middle of the game due to his gank potential. He can quickly turn the tide of a fight with his Ultimate a and use it defensively to scare enemies. Nocturne inflicts a lot of damage during the middle of the game. He will have access to his basic items and can easily choose the enemies when they turn alone."}

Avoid shoving the wave in either unless you want to recall.\n\nThe lane brushes can be used during duels as you may be able to drop vision in them. You may also be able to l enemies easily from them as the enemy won't see it coming.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate t, you should be able to dish out a lot of damage. It will allow you to take over fights easily and act as a disruptor.        "}
{"text": "As velkoz, Vel'Koz's level 6 is a massive powerspike as it lets him utilize his Passive fully. It is a great finishing ability that is best used against enemies who are clumped together.\n\nHis first item will give a massive boost to his overall effectiveness in the lane. It will increase his burst damage combo, and he can force enemies to recall abruptly quite frequently in the lane.\n\nThe greater the number of points in his Q, the greater his poke potential and overall damage output. Since his Q can slow targets, it can allow Vel'Koz to completely CC the enemy and destroy them."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn will try to poke you from a safe distance. Do not stay clumped with minions else you will get chunked out massively.\n\nQuinn may try to roam post-six. Let your laners know if she is missing, and see if you can set wards in the river previously.\n\nStick to the lane and force Quinn to roam by making the lane completely dormant. Only look for all-ins when your Jungler is arriving.\n\nKeep the wave close to the tower and focus on getting tankier in this matchup. Failing to do so can easily allow the enemy to all-in you."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie will now have her complete construction. Her ability to impact the team fights will be at its peak, and she can easily flank and get killed on the enemy backline. She will not have to worry much about being taken out of the square without her Ultimate R to save herself during this game phase. This ability will be almost all the time increasing. Annie can take the game alone if she manages to control the placement of the vision around the card. Any form of death brush will be deadly for the enemies due to Annie's overall damage."}
{"text": "Against diana, Once Diana hits level 6, she can start to receive ganks from her Jungler as her Ultimate R deals a lot of damage and is CC. With this in mind, try to ward the river and side bushes to spot the enemy Jungler before they show up in your lane.\n\nWhenever Diana lands her Q, she could look for the all-in thanks to the reset on her t. Try and play safer when her Q has landed and wait for it to disappear before walking forward.\n\nDiana is rather weak if she doesn\u2019t get kills early on. With this in mind, try not to feed her and ping whenever she goes missing as Diana will look to roam if she can\u2019t kill anyone in mid."}
{"text": "As camille, Avoid taking too much damage early from self-attacks. Play around your cooldown E and stay back while it's on the cooldown. Once you're level 2 or 3, you can play aggressive. Only enter if your ADC can fight though. Try to play around your cooldown Ultimate. Make sure to use it whenever it's high."}
{"text": "Against akshan, Try and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make his all-in less effective.\n\nPost 6, try to interrupt or somehow force Akshan to top his Ultimate. This will increase your survivability and it will be put on a short cooldown.\n\nKeep in mind that early armor will be very beneficial in this matchup. Akshan is an AD champion, so picking up early armor will protect you from some of his damage.\n"}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Having three points in his Ultimate R is a massive powerpike for Xin Zhao. This will allow him to use the ability frequently, giving him a global advantage during the fights. Xin will have two of his capabilities maximized by level 14. It is a significant boost to his duel power, and he will let him dominate 1 v 1's with the greatest ease. During this phase of the game, Xin will be truly tanky while simultaneously inflicting a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that it will be difficult to remove, and still or CC'd mainly carries death if they can't get Xin away from them."}

Keep this in mind when trying to 1v1 him as he is pretty good early on.\n\nViego\u2019s level 6 power spike is very good. He will often go for insanely aggressive plays with his Ultimate R.\n\nIf he takes over the body of a fed enemy champion, he will be extremely difficult to deal with. However, if he takes over a weak champion, he may not be that big of a threat.\n"}
{"text": "As twistedfate, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass."}
{"text": "As sona, Stay with your team at any time. Avoid moving around the map alone, so you don't get caught. Getting caught outside will lead your team to play 4v5. Don't take care of it alone unless you know where the enemy is. Your damage will be pretty serious for the enemy team. Make sure you are positioned and not taken out of nowhere or murdered by assassins. Don't hesitate to use your Ultimate R. It's mainly because it will be on a short cooldown, and your Ultimate R will be up frequently."}
{"text": "As malphite, Weak during the early game, especially against consistent poke damage which can prevent him from regenerating his Passive shield.\n\nPre-six, he is quite susceptible to poke so he will be forced to play defensively. He probably won\u2019t be getting any ganks either due to him not having his Ultimate h.\n\nProper vision control from the enemy team will prevent Malphite from catching the enemy team off-guard. This will reduce his effectiveness and will force him to find other ways to engage on the enemy team. "}
{"text": "Against rengar, At level 1, Rengar can try to cheese you to get an early health advance. You can reduce its all-in potential while waiting for it to show before walking forward. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map so Rengar can't jump bushes and trade with you. Moreover, stay towards the lower side of the track at any time to make it harder to jump on you. Once Rengar touches level 6 and unlocks his ultimate R, he can look for the all-in. Otherwise, if he is unable to kill you, he can push the wave and try to wander with his ultimate R. If he leaves track 6, make sure you ping that he went to reduce the chances of getting him a success R Ultimate Roff."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus will seek to divide the thrust throughout the middle of the game. It is good to divide the thrust thanks to his Q. When Nasus is divided push, you can use the number advantage to start a team fight. During the fight, check the map and keep an eye on Nasus. Be ready to disengage if he is about to take a turn. If Nasus gathers for team fights, try to lock him up with CC so that he is unable to get on your portages and kill them with his Q and R."}
{"text": "As neeko, This is especially true if it goes for AD construction. Can't be very effective if the enemy puts the right vision around and can notice Neeko changing its shapes or hiding in a brush to land its E. Due to its thrust power, it can be very sensitive to ganks especially after using its W."}
{"text": "As kayle, Kayle is weak early on; hence she will have to depend on her Q for most of her poke and farming in the lane. This is the phase that needs to be played very carefully by Kayle.\n\nHer level six is a massive power spike due to her ranged auto-attacks. This will allow her to play more liberally and let her play the lane more safely.\n\nKayle's first item will help her a lot with trading and farming. This is really helpful for her and will help her scale up quickly from now on.        "}

If he goes Red Kayn, he will be tankier, if he goes Blue Kayn, he will deal tons of damage. \n\nAt level 6, Kayn can be more aggressive and go for riskier plays as he can use his Ultimate R to protect him from dying. Keep this in mind when fighting him. \n\nKayn will be looking to skirmish as much as he can in the early game so he can get his form early. "}
{"text": "As taliyah, Extremely squishy and can be killed if some form of crowd control lands on her. This is especially true during the early game.\n\nHer Ultimate R has the probability of getting her entire team killed if used improperly. She is also very vulnerable when her C is down.\n\nThe worked ground mechanic on her Q can easily allow her laners to play in the middle of the lane as she can keep barraging her enemies with continuous Qs."}
{"text": "As kennen, Level 6 is really strong for Kennen because it gets access to an AoE CC capability that can quickly turn the tide of a fight. Kennen should try to flank the enemies for maximum efficiency. Its first element of the element will significantly increase its damage. Kennen is unpleasant for its poke damage, and the element will only improve it. Kennen is not very early because it only relies on AP to maximize its poke damage. He will want to use the track brushes to catch the out-of-guard enemy whenever possible."}
{"text": "As nunu, His tankness is out of bounds during this phase of the game. He can quickly shoot enemies and peel for his wears at the same time due to his overall tankness. A maximum-out Ultimate R will allow Nunu to flatten a lot of damage in a short period of time. If he can set up a death brush, he will automatically win the fight. His team fight at the end of the game will be extreme because he is very tanky, and his frontline ability will make it really easy for his team to succeed in the fights."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks wants to poke and stay safe in the game very early. He's not very strong, so his job is to survive early. Fiddlesticks first power peak is when he reaches level 6. Unlocking his Ultimate R offers him an additional pressure to kill in the way and will allow him to start looking for aggressive parts. After Fiddlesticks finished his first component element, he will be a little stronger and can start to exchange more aggressively with the enemy."}
{"text": "As viktor, Very efficient wave clear which also allows him to damage multiple enemies at the same time. This gives him an innate advantage against ranged matchups, as well as lane priority in general.\n\nCan disrupt an entire fight with his d and Ultimate m, so fighting in close spaces is very advantageous for him. He can also chase a single target down with some fancy footwork, by using his r.\n\nHis poke damage is obnoxious and very strong. This can allow him to force his enemy laner out of the lane and then take objectives with a numbers advantage. In the bot lane, he can use the lane brushes for an added effect of obscurity from enemy laners."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Clear its turrets as quickly as possible. This will prevent it from pushing as quickly as possible, and it will reduce its gold revenues. While clearing its turrets is the key, let it push the minion wave, then clear the turrets. Your level 6 is stronger than his, but you can't kill him unless you free his turrets first!"}
{"text": "Against briar, Her skirmishing power early on is quite high. Keep this in mind when attempting to fight her alone.\n\nWhen invading a Briar, try to hide in bushes before jumping on her. Wait for her to use her abilities on the camps and then strike her down.\n\nIf you\u2019re low or if you see an ally low on health overstaying their welcome, ping and communicate as she will look to get easy kills with her Ultimate R.\n"}
{"text": "Against karma, Force a team fight as quickly as you can so Karma isn\u2019t able to poke your team down before you have the chance to engage. Delaying a team fight will allow her to harass your team and make the fight much riskier. \n\nIf Karma uses her empowered Q when trying to poke, you should use the cooldown to start a team fight. When Karma\u2019s Ultimate a is down, she cannot give her team a huge shield d which will make fighting much easier.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to invest in an Executioner\u2019s Calling. It will reduce her healing and shielding and it will make winning the team fight a lot easier."}
{"text": "Against lillia, Post 6, fighting Lillia alone could be difficult as she can use her Ultimate R to protect herself or turn around the exchange. Avoid committing to fights unless you are certain you can kill her quickly.\n\nKeeping the wave closer to your side of the map early will force her to overextend for the farm which you can abuse to all-in her or set up your Jungler.\n\nLook out for Lillia\u2019s build. She has a very versatile build path and will build lots of different items. Keep this in mind and buy items that counter her build."}
{"text": "As karthus, Getting your base elements will allow you to run down enemies and burn them to oblivion. Use your ultimate e at regular intervals to make sure you can help your teammates. Fight close to the bottlenecks to maximize the effectiveness of your combat team. Sometimes it would be wise to throw you into the enemy team, especially if the enemy front line decides to all-in-one without any follow-up. Another point in your ultimate e will allow you to destroy the opposition due to your constant burn damage. Use your e properly to make sure you win intertwined fights."}
{"text": "As kayle, A monster of the end of the game because of its passive functioning. If it can go through the laning phase and can acquire CS in an orderly manner, it will easily take the game later. Its Ultimate R can allow it to save a teammate as well as herself depending on the situation. If it is behind it, it can easily use it on a murderer in its team so that it can keep the enemy distracted from its presence. The Q and W allows it to catch up with ease and get rid of them once it is powerful enough."}
{"text": "As jayce, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nUse your s to harass the enemy as much as possible before committing to the team fight. Getting them low first will make it easier for you to win the fight.\n\nPeel for your carries and focus the nearest enemy champion if you\u2019re weak. If you\u2019re ahead, focus the backline and try to take them down instead."}
{"text": "Against annie, Items such as Banshee, Guardian, QSS or ZhonyaS Hurglass are excellent against Annie because they protect you from her damage. If she advances, make sure to invest in one of them. In team fights, don't gather too closely because Tibbers R is an AOE capability that can stun several members of your team if you are grouped together. Stay close, but not very close that she can CC all your team. Lack of mobility and defensive statistics make her difficult to fight. Try to delay team fights as long as you can while you push her down. If she is weak, engage or use her Q or Tibbers R aggressively will be very dangerous for her."}
{"text": "Against kaisa, Kai-Sa is vulnerable to the CC. Try to lock her up at the beginning of the fight so she can't bring down tons of damage. Keep in mind that Kai-Sa can use her Ultimate R to reposition herself in a team fight. She may be able to avoid the CC or strokes of skill in this way and turn the exchange. Kai-Sa will be pushed by her Support in a team fight. Try to take her Support first so that it is left defenceless."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, When Qiyana has her river element (blue), doesn't exaggerate too much or doesn't play very aggressively. There is probably one reason why she picked up this and her Jungler can be nearby. Play safer when she holds this Element. Before-6, Qiyana will constantly push the minion wave with her Q. Stand outside the minion wave at all times so that she is unable to push and poke at the same time. But, not stand by a wall so she can't you Ult R in it."}
{"text": "Against elise, Elise relies heavily on landing her Cocoon to initiate fights or ganks. If you\u2019re nearby, you can counter gank her as she doesn\u2019t have much to offer once her E is on cooldown.\n\nElise has a lot of burst damage and can solo kill most champions in the early game. If you\u2019re not playing a tanky champion or one with heavy CC, try not to fight her one on one.\n\nHer Rappel ability allows her to drop down on any enemy target including minions and wards. It also allows her to drop tower aggro, play it safe and back when low on health."}

Play safer and avoid committing aggressive plays while it is on cooldown.\n\nAhri has multiple skill shots which makes her somewhat harder than many champions. Additionally, her E hitbox isn\u2019t the biggest, so it can be difficult to land.\n\nAhri can be difficult to play into team compositions with heavy CC. While she does have tools to help her dodge these abilities, she will be limited on how and when she can use her Ultimate. For example, she may have to wait for the enemy to use their CC tool before using her R aggressively."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As karma, Karma is pretty decent in the fights at the end of the game because her kit provides a lot of utility and damage at the same time. It's perfect for her team, especially because her abilities will almost always increase. She will offer a lot of utility during the game at the end of the game, especially in neutral and objective fights. Team fights will be really useful because of her d. She will have two of her abilities maximized at level 13, which will give her a huge boost of damage and will let her peel for her without effort."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, Continue until you touch level 3. Once you do, start to glove when possible. Just make sure you are not detected from the advance, however. Use your y very carefully as this ability can quickly get you an advance if used correctly. Also, counter-gang the enemy as much as you can. Once you get your Ultimate n, you should have a higher impact on team fighting. Make sure you target high priority champions when possible."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong will be unable to fight as a team if you can trap him before he has the chance to engage. Delay a team fight while you trap him as much as possible. Do not fight inside the jungle or around goals. You will usually be gathered together which will allow Wukong to get a great Ultimate noff."}
{"text": "As poppy, Level 16 is dull because it won't get much, except for a reduced cooling on its Ultimate R. It won't be as strong as other ultimates. Its tankness will be phenomenal during this phase of the game. It can continue to absorb the damage and act as a reliable front line for its team in the fights. It will play a pivotal point during this phase of the game. It will make its tanky and leave its first face on the enemy team. It will play a massive role in team fighting for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As warwick, He is not the best champion when he is behind, however, he can build full tank and be the reservoir for his team. His ultimate R will also be useful. If the enemy the area away from the farm, it will be difficult for Warwick to pick up gold and XP. It is also a big problem if the enemy freezes as he does not have various abilities to help him on the farm. His ultimate R makes him vulnerable. If the enemy locks him with CC, his ultimate R will be stopped."}
{"text": "Against draven, Draven is an early game monster with his g and can snowball easily if he gets an early murder thanks to his passive. On Dravens first return, he will usually get a expensive AD article. If you don't buy the same article exactly like him, he will always come out in front of the trades. Take note of his first article and be ready to play safer. At level 6, Draven will look to go to kill if he hasn't already got one with the help of his Ultimate t. Respect his all-in-the-world potential and play safer when you're low."}
{"text": "As jhin, His Passive allows him to blow up the squishies with ease. This allows him to get a huge advance early and then capitalize on her, and finish the game before the key enemies come online. The CC extension tracking on his kit with his W and E is really strong. That's what makes him really good with champions who have hard CC or slowed down in their arsenal. He can continue to make regular short trades with his self-attacks and Q. This will allow him to soften his target without the help of his Support, and once they are low enough, he can all."}
{"text": "As seraphine, The third point in her Ultimate R will help Seraphine out a lot during team fights. She can dish out a lot of damage, and the CC will allow her team to collapse on the enemy quickly.\n\nShe should be really great as the game goes on because she will be getting all her items by now. She will need to take care of her fighting positioning to ensure that she isn't picked off.\n\nHer pick potential will only increase during this phase of the game as her E and Ultimate R should be beneficial."}
{"text": "As twitch, Twitch's early ganks are really potent, and his level two gank is incredibly obnoxious. Twitch's s allows him to remain undetected, which lets him bypass vision during the early game.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike for Twitch as it allows him to excel in significant fights. His ability to impact grouped-up fights will let him take over the early game with ease.\n\nTwitch's objective control is quite solid as he can bamboozle enemies with his s. It is effortless for him to make an enemy laner recall abruptly after a gank and then go for the objective with his teammates."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah will want to delay a team fight for as long as possible while she pokes you down with her Q. Try and force a fight as soon as you spot her.\n\nAvoid splitting up and playing alone. Taliyah\u2019s Ultimate R will allow her to pick off enemies who are alone or isolated without assistance. Do not push up too far forward if you have no one nearby.\n\nTaliyah has good pick potential with her C. If you don\u2019t know where Taliyah is in the mid-game, do not walk around Summoners Rift alone and avoid areas without vision as she may be looking to set up a surprise attack."}
{"text": "As shen, You will want to beat him up from a distance when possible. This will make it easy for you to chunk out Shen.\n\nPost-six, you will want to bait Shen in for an all-in. Once that is done, use your Ult and blow him up.\n\nAlways play near your tentacles when possible. It will prevent Shen from looking for all-ins on you regularly.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As ksante, Wait for its dash to be used before doing anything major in this matchup. Not respecting can land you in all kinds of problems. Your goal is to CC it no matter what during team fighting. Keep your team as safe as possible from it. Short trades are usually a bad idea for you because of how your kit works and your lack of mobility. Try to reach the enemy rearline when possible to cause chaos. Keep the wave somewhere in the middle of the track. It will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Her all-in burst damage is quite high and can easily get rid of squishy enemy carries. Once she unlocks her Ultimate R, any enemy carry who is left alone will die as soon as Evelynn goes in on them.\n\nOnce she gets one or two items, she becomes a force to reckon with. Combined with her level six, if the enemy team doesn\u2019t invest in Control Wards, they will get run down easily.\n\nHer Ultimate R allows her to escape situations where she may get CC\u2019d and killed. This allows her to just faceplant herself on one enemy carry, kill them, and ult back to a safe spot."}
{"text": "As chogath, Just make sure that you land the last success on the minions so you get your health back! Its e has a very large reach. This makes it easier for it to land and the CC. The only problem is that it can be difficult for it to land against champions with dashes or escape tools. Cho=Gath is a strong scaler with a versatile construction trajectory. This means that it is great in the last stages of the game regardless of how before or behind it was in the first stages of the game."}
{"text": "As ashe, At level 9, Ashe will have her y maxed. This is an important power spike for Ashe as she can use it to poke the enemy down before her team commits to a team fight.\n\nWhen Ashe hits level 11, she will put a secondary point in her Ultimate w. Her Ultimate w will have a short cooldown and she will be able to look for picks frequently throughout the mid-game.\n\nAshe should\u2019ve completed an item or two during the mid-game. This makes her a huge threat in team fights as her damage output in conjunction with her poke can be devastating to deal with."}
{"text": "As vi, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies ahead. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure you try to exploit your early advantage.\n\nLook to secure objectives whenever they\u2019re up. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes along.\n\nFind a healthy balance between ganking your allies, farming your jungle and securing objectives. Make sure you do not fall behind in XP by trying to constantly gank."}
{"text": "As diana, Diana can look for trades from level 3 onwards as she will have access to all 3 of her basic abilities. Try to go for aggressive plays to gain an early health advantage.\n\nAs Diana deals a lot of burst damage, she should look for constant favourable trades around her Q and t once she has picked up her Mythic item. Don\u2019t be afraid to fight if you have the item advantage.\n\nDiana\u2019s level 6 is very strong. Her Ultimate R deals a lot of burst damage and can be used to get kills over and over again in lane. Because it\u2019s such a strong tool, you can also look to roam and help your allies if the enemy laner is playing incredibly safe"}
{"text": "As viktor, By this time, he will have his first significant ability upgraded. This allows him to garner much team fight pressure, and now he can take regular fights.\n\nAnother point in his Ultimate m will allow him to dish out a lot of consistent DPS and use the ability quite frequently.\n\nAt level 9, his y will be maxed out. This will let him clear waves in a jiffy and deal tons of damage to targets hit by it.        "}
{"text": "As lux, Lux will not have many items and will hurt a lot due to her AP ratios. Any squishy who gets caught by her g will most definitely end up dying.\n\nShe will spike really hard at level 11. This is mainly because of her Ultimate n upgrade, which will increase the damage of that ability while drastically reducing its cooldown. The mid-lane brushes will be a good place to wait for unsuspecting enemies.\n\nLux is generally good during team fights, but she will excel when fighting in choke points. The enemy won't be able to do anything to avoid Lux's g and will be zoned out by her l poke.        "}
{"text": "As zed, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, At level 13, Jarvan will have both his e and d maxed out. This means that he can all-in the enemies more frequently and deal a significant amount of damage with ease. Bonus points if he can flank the enemy team.\n\nOnce he manages to get three points in his Ultimate m, his ability to initiate fights will increase. With a short Ultimate m cooldown, we can expect him to be picking enemies left, right, and center.\n\nJarvan IV becomes quite tanky during the late game due to his items and build. He can soak a lot of damage for his team and can easily peel for his carries if need be."}
{"text": "As swain, Very immobile and is weak during the early laning phase. This is especially true if he is facing a champion who can all-in and CC him.\n\nIs quite vulnerable when his E is down as it is his main form of CC. \n\nGrievous wounds can completely counter his kit during the early game and also affect his mid-game. He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he won\u2019t have the amplified healing and AoE damage."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 6, you are both equal in terms of damage, but you will have the best to engage with your R. Try to lure his E before using your R on him. At level 2 Ezreal will want to sting you and then use E to go away. Try to get up so you will always be able to take your R on him. Be aware of Ezreal standing in brushes, as he might try to use his R and then difficult to engage with his E and follow with a W and Q. As Kalista you will want to freeze the wave when facing Ezreal. By doing this, you will make it possible for your Jungler to gank you."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, When he reaches level 6, his death pressure in the track increases. Expects that he frequently looks for aggressive parts with his Ultimate R. His next major power peak is at level 11 when he puts the second point in his Ultimate R. After completing his first component, Malzahars damage in the track will increase a lot. His E will be very boring to treat as well."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he gets three points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to use it frequently and inflicts a lot of damage to the enemy team with a boost. He should be able to easily catch the out-of-guard enemies. Zac will have a lot of items during this stage of the game. This means that he will get a massive boost to his survival and damage and will be a strength to count with. Zac will be massively tanky during this stage, and the enemy team will have a hard time to kill. This also means that he can act as an activator for a team and then return to peel for his portages once the engagement is over."}
{"text": "Against kalista, The extended trades will always favor Kalista thanks to its r. Try and avoid going to expand the trades with it. Kalista is the first peak of power when she takes her Greaves from Berserker as he will give her the first piece of attack speed that she needs snowball. Once Kalista has finished Hurricane Runaan, she will pump much more damage and apply Rend re stacks really quickly."}
{"text": "Against thresh, Thresh will be looking for picks with his Q to start the team fight. Make sure no one on your team is out of position or too far forward as it may allow the enemy to start the team fight.\n\nIf Thresh misses his Q in a team fight, collapse on him and take him down. Thresh is really immobile and you should try to abuse him when he makes a mistake.\n\nAs Thresh will often go to ward alone, you could look to ambush him when he goes to place a ward. Taking him down early will leave his backline vulnerable to attack. You could also use the numbers advantage to take the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "As kalista, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage (like an engage Support).\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As ornn, Ornn is really motionless so making it fall will be really easy. Just make sure you don't let it CC you. Post six, you can easily prevent Ornn from getting rotated by simply putting it to sleep using your ult. During team fights, make sure that you CC Ornn as much as possible. It will save your team from a world of pain and CC. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy doesn't have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Its poke can be difficult to handle, so position near the minions for some protection. Blow out its E before entering for an advantage. Stand near the minions, but not in the wave, to limit its wave thrust with W. Let it grow early; consider coordinating with your jungler for gank opportunities."}
{"text": "As swain, His early game is excellent as he can completely CC and blow up an enemy target when required. Using it from the lane brushes will allow him to reap a lot of benefits.\n\nLevel six is an excellent spike as he can now control the pace of a team fight. He can easily be in between the enemy team while dealing a lot of health and regenerating a lot of health in return.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities frequently and dish out a lot of damage. It helps a lot with his overall laning prowess."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, 3 points in his Ultimate e will not be an excellent power spike. This is because it only ensures his prolonged survivability and nothing else.\n\nHe will be dealing a lot of damage during the later parts of the game. This is since he will have multiple items and will be able to duel anyone.\n\nHis late-game scaling is phenomenal, and he can one-shot squishy enemies after slowing them down and catching up to them. It will give him a pivotal role in the game."}
{"text": "As yorick, Yorick's Maiden will be powerful from level 16 that his Ultimate R will be fully maximized. It will also allow Yorick to use the ability often. Yorick can continue to push the division or decide to join the team fights at this stage of the game. Anyway, he will make a plethora of damage and excel in the enclumed battles. Yorick's second ability will be maximized at level 14. This means that the duel will become really difficult for the enemy, and Yorick will be able to turn a fight on his head easily."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Having 3 points in its Ultimate R is another important power peak for Vel'Koz. This will allow it to melt throughout everyone like a hot butter knife. Its burst damage will be immaculate as well. Vel'Koz is good in team fights during this game due to its Passive and Ultimate R. This, in combination with the rest of its abilities, will compensate for some odious poke damage. Having its complete construction will allow Vel'Koz to burst people like balloons. Any squishy that gets caught in the crossfire will definitely die."}
{"text": "As sivir, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Try to end the game as quickly as you can as the longer the game goes, the stronger Kayle becomes.\n\nKayle will tend to be split pushing during the mid-game. You can use this time to force a team fight with the numbers advantage while she is pushing in a side lane. \n\nKayle is rather vulnerable when her Ultimate R is on cooldown. Try to force fights and kill her while her Ultimate R is down."}
{"text": "As veigar, You will now have your basic items, which means you will hit like a truck. When in the way, make sure to continue stacking your Passive frequently. It is vital for the late game. Do not show up to neutral, objective fights will be a cardinal sin that you want to avoid. All your abilities make it very difficult for the enemy team to be concentrated near the pit, hence to use it to your advantage. If the enemy is too mobile or CC-heavy, just get a defensive element like a Zhonya Hurglass. He will keep you safe from getting a shot before being able to do anything."}
{"text": "As morgana, During the middle game, you will want to push the wave and then work with your teammates to choose your enemies when possible. Your Q should help you a lot with that. Getting a Zhonya's Hurglass will amplify your potential all-in-one, and you will be able to flatten the humongous amounts of damage without taking a lot in return. Neutral Goal fights should be your bread and butter like your Q, W, and Ultimate R completely cut the paths for enemies to even get closer to the objective pits."}
{"text": "As sett, Can be kited to oblivion, especially when he is against a ranged carry with some form or dash or peel.\n\nMisuse of his W can get him killed as it is his only form of damage mitigation. He can\u2019t escape easily if someone all-ins him after he uses this ability.\n\nIf the enemy is smart, they will avoid grouping up during fights. This will prevent Sett from using his Ultimate R effectively, as he won\u2019t be able to land a lot of damage or slow multiple members of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As warwick, Keep running around the map and look for choices with your Jungler. Your W & E should allow you to CC and kill enemies quickly. During neutral objective fights, you should be able to help your teammates a lot by making sure that the enemy cannot enter the river. This will allow your Jungler to have an easy time getting the target in question. You should be able to support yourself massively in this fight so make sure to use your *Q* and Ultimate R regularly and correctly. Avoid getting CC'd at any cost while doing this."}
{"text": "As ornn, Don't fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or search for fights when it's available that you're going to miss. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the last stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your ports to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As drmundo, Whenever the enemy wave has been cleared and the wave is pushed into its turn, it can easily use its Q and E to run the enemy down. The slow Q will allow it to catch up with ease. Its Q should allow it to avoid the ganks with ease. Combined with the R speed, it is relatively difficult to kill during the early match unless it pushes completely up. Unlocking its ultimate R gives it a peak of power. The health gain makes it almost impossible for him to die. The bonus movement speed will also allow him to catch up his target or escape a gank."}
{"text": "As nocturne, If you want to fight him, you need to bait his W first or else he's just going to win the 1v1. Post 6, don't steal his Ultimate, because he won't help you much in the 1v1 against him. He's a Jungler earlier than you. Try to match his pressure in any way possible (flying camps, counter-gang, or taking goals). Investing in the armor early can really be and he will protect you in the 1v1 against him,"}
{"text": "As malphite, His game plan for the early game should involve power farming till he gets his Ultimate h. This is because he has no way to gank other lanes unless they are drastically overextended.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as Malphite will now be able to pull off ganks and disrupt flights. This is really helpful when the enemy is immobile and has no Flash.\n\nHis first item component will allow him to take more fights and clear the jungle camps quickly. This is beneficial for Malphite as it gives him more avenues to gank quickly.        "}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Trendamere is extremely strong in the way, especially when his resource bar is filled. This means that he will arrange a lot of damage and heal a lot when he uses his Q. He can exert a lot of pressure in the way while simultaneously preserving his survival. He helps a lot against the champions of range and melee. His first element will help him a lot in the way. He will give him a strong boost of damage with an increased survival that will be exceptionally useful for the duo in the way."}
{"text": "Against yone, Yone is better at trading once he unlocks his Ultimate R as he offers him tons of pressure to kill. Once Yone gets 100% chance of critical strike, he takes a lot of damage. Remember that his Passive gives him double chance of writing. Yone is very good in team fights if he is able to get a good Ultimate R off. Don't forget to stay away when it's possible."}
{"text": "Against talon, When teams are grouping, make sure you ward your flanks to spot Talon before he is able to jump over the wall and assassinate your team.\n\nAs soon as Talon engages, try your hardest to burst him down before he is able to disengage and deal lots of damage. \n\nAs Talon is an assassin, expect him to look for picks with his Ultimate R. Avoid walking around Summoners Rift alone. Do not walk in unwarded areas of the map if you know Talon is nearby."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble is excellent during late-game fights as his Ultimate b and his basic abilities will all hit like a truck now, especially during team fights.\n\nMaxing out his Ultimate b will reduce the ability's cooldown and allow him to use it frequently. It will be a deciding factor during the objective fights.\n\nRumble will dish out a lot of damage during this phase of the game. His ability to melt through enemy health bars will force his enemies to play defensively."}
{"text": "As ksante, You will be extremely tanky at this stage of the game, so you can tank a lot of damage for your team. Continue looking for choices with your Ultimate in the late part. Make sure you group with your team and try to get off key enemy targets. You must be grouped with your team in the late part. Like the tank, the enemy will just hire your team as they know you."}
{"text": "As jayce, Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressively and looking for aggressive parts. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. When you touch level 6, you have to play a little safer because you don't have an ultimate G, unlike all the other Top laners. Play respectfully and stay within maximum range while harassing the enemy from afar. Use your s to poke the enemy as often as possible. Use your base attacks in conjunction with this ability to get the low enemy."}
{"text": "As ashe, At level 16, Ashe will have 3 points in her Ultimate w. It will also be on a much lower cooldown (on a cooldown lower than the enemy will think). This allows her to get surprising choices to win the late match for her team. In the later parts of the game, Ashe will be at the maximum or almost max build. Its damage release will be incredibly high if she can 1, poke the enemy with her y, 2 activate her Q and 3, kite in the fights of the late game team."}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, Jarvan\u2019s level 2 is pretty strong as he can go for a d into e and knock you up. Make sure you hit level 2 first so you can counter this engage.\n\nOnce Jarvan hits level 6, his kill pressure intensifies. If you are without Flash, he can easily enclose you with his Ultimate m which will leave you incredibly vulnerable.\n\nAfter Jarvan has completed his first item, his utility and strength increases. Keep this in mind as his shield from Aery and his d will be increased."}
{"text": "As shen, Your goal in the early game is to play safe, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy laner. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online.\n\nOnce you have quite a few levels under your belt, you should look for short favourable trades. As you\u2019re not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in lane."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus will have a massive amount of piles during this phase of the game. This can easily allow him to carry a single enemy blow that are relaxed by the enemy team. Nasus' tankness will be a strength to count with as he won't die as long as he finds a target to use his Q on. This will provide his team with a reliable front lining. His main power point is during this phase of the game, as he will have several items, multiple piles, and will be able to go openly all-in and choose enemy champions out of his will."}
{"text": "Against kaisa, Do not 1v1 Kai.Sa if you are alone as her Q will focus you. Fighting near minions will be useful as they will block some of her damage. Prolonged trades work for Kai.Sa thanks to her Passive. Try to keep the trades short so she can't activate her Passive on you.When you remember, especially when weak, make sure to keep an eye on your champion as Kai.Sa can try to finish you with her W. Do not shop until you have successfully recalled to ensure maximum safety."}
{"text": "As twitch, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily.

{"text": "As diana, She should be able to one-shot enemies with ease from now on. Her main goal will be to fight around clumped areas to get a multi-man Ultimate R on the enemy team.\n\nShe should still focus on the enemy backline during team fights while avoiding any form of CC on her. Picking off enemies to make team fights unfair should also be an excellent way to snowball her lead.\n\nIf Diana is ahead, she should look for picks or ambush the enemy as they walk through their Jungle. Taking one enemy down could be enough to win the next fight or take the Baron."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven will be looking to split push when no team fights are occurring. Make sure somebody who can contest her is sent to stop her from pushing. Avoid fighting her during the mid-game though unless you\u2019re stronger.\n\nTeamfights will be difficult for Riven as she is prone to CC, disengage and gets kited by champions easily. To make team fighting easier, she will probably flank or Flash in to engage. Ward to the side when sieging an objective to spot her before she gets the chance to engage.\n\nRiven is quite good at picking off champions when they\u2019re too far forward or alone. Don\u2019t let her pick someone off by staying in line with each other. Do not group too closely as it may allow her to get a 5 person r stun."}
{"text": "Against viego, It is quite vulnerable to the CC and if you can kill it before it has its combo, the enemy will lose on a lot of damage. Keep track of who it can change at the beginning and during a fight. Try to play accordingly all its new potential abilities. Try and avoid fighting in the river or in the jungle, because Viegos E can make it very difficult to kill. It is better to fight at the opening or after using its E. Its E allows it to be super slippery."}

As you\u2019re not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in lane."}
{"text": "As nocturne, After entering with your Ultimate a, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Playing around your Ultimate has in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate is standing. Fighting with outside will make the fights of the late game team much harder."}
{"text": "As ornn, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive games. You enjoy extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Try to delay team fights for as long as possible while you harass the enemy and poke them down with your Q.

{"text": "Against singed, Singed will often seek to replace the first wave between the two towers installing a huge early pressure leading to gold and the led experience. Singed can=t fight both you and the minions simultaneously, so escort your minions as they walk the way to force him to walk back to the track. If Singed is able to replace you firm, just let the enemy minions hit your turn and focus on the agriculture that you can. Do not lose tons of health trying to tank the minion wave. Do not hunt Singed. Chasing Singed is a bad idea that his l inflicts a lot of damage if you are in it too long."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Gangplank's level 6 is a good powerspike for him in this lane, especially if Gankplank has been pushed in the entire time. This will allow him to chase down enemies with ease and kill them if he has already poke them with his r. It also has a significant impact during team fights.\n\nHis initial core item will give him a massive boost in dueling power. He can now go, and 1 v 1 targets with ease and can completely blow enemies up with his barrels.\n\nHis early game is weak as he is entirely dependent on items to be dishing out damage. However, he can compensate for it using his r to poke enemies out with ease and use the lane brushes to conceal his barrels. It will catch enemies off-guard and will allow Gankplank to get the upper hand."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Evelynn will max her Q at level 9. She will be much stronger at this stage of the game.\n\nEve is very good in the mid-game as enemies will be walking around the map on their own. As Evelynn is an assassin, if she can get picks on isolated targets she can get herself a huge lead.\n\nAt level 11, Evelynn\u2019s Ultimate R will deal more damage and she will be incredibly strong at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As tristana, Try and stick with your Support throughout the mid-game. You\u2019re quite vulnerable and easy to kill if you\u2019re on your own. By staying with your Support, your survivability will increase.\n\nContinue picking up farm in the side lanes when no team fights are occurring, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to dish out damage in fights.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}

{"text": "As quinn, Dusty during the middle of the game and try to secure the secondary goals. That said, keep an eye on the map that you can not yet be able to 1 v 3 yet. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from split push. Although you are a really strong split pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to take nearby."}
{"text": "As rumble, Use the track brushes and regularly crush Rumble when possible. This is the best way to win this track. Avoid fighting when its resource bar is half filled. You will take a lot of damage and you will probably die even if its ultimate is ready. Its Ultimate can easily separate you from your allies, which makes you get signed by the Rumble team. Be very careful about it. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy has no kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax's first item component allows him to chase down enemies during an extended fight. It will let him stack up his Passive and completely decimate his enemies. Going for regular short burst trades using the lane brushes will help him a lot.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent power spike as it will increase his survivability during fights. Once he gets more items, this ability will help him kill enemies with ease, and he can take over the game with his scaling.\n\nJax isn't very strong early on as he is quite item reliant. He should be focusing on farming and short skirmishes to clean up kills. Neutral objective fights are situations where he can capitalize on this objective. He should also be using the lane brushes to go for short burst trades in the lane."}
{"text": "As teemo, It can wander around the map and place its Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow it to detect enemies as well as get killed on unsuspecting low-health targets. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow it to inflict high amounts of bursting damage and will allow it to kill its enemies quickly. It is not remarkable in team fighting, so it should either resort to secure peaks and blow people with its abilities or just separate by pushing until the enemy responds to it."}
{"text": "As maokai, 2 points in his Ultimate R will be a good peak of power because he can use the ability frequently and use it effectively during the objective fights. It also serves as a good ability of choice. Maokai is quite decent in the team fights at the end of the game. This is due to his Ultimate R and his all-in-one combo, which guarantees that any champion he aims at will die if his team follows the engagement. Maokai's first ability will be maximized to level 9. This is terrible news for the enemy team because they can expect to find gaules or a Maokai with an all-in-one super powerful combo in the jungle brushes."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Once Ornn unlocks his Ultimate R, he will have an easier time in lane. He will be able to look for kills and even set his Jungler up once he has it available to him. Expect him to play more aggressive post 6.\n\nEvery time Ornn gets an item upgrade, he will be much stronger as each unique upgrade offers him extra stats.\n\nOrnn is good in team fights. Try to fight when he\u2019s not there as it will make team fighting much easier. Also, setting him behind in the early game will make him less strong in team fights."}
{"text": "As lissandra, If you lose a lot of health, you will never be able to play aggressively. Watch your positioning, dodge Lissandra's damage and don't let them abuse you for free. You're weaker than them every time they have their Ultimate Up. If you're at risk of dying, always remember level 5 so you won't be killed when they hit level 6. Let Lissandra push you into your turn. It has a lot of counter-play potential, so let it push and wait for the ganks."}
{"text": "Against udyr, Udyr does not have a reliable engagement tool other than running to your team. Kite him therefore he is unable to land his CC on your carts. If he ever uses his Flash E to engage, remember that he has no other escape tool. Focus it as quickly as possible. Since he is not really good in team fights, you could force a team fight while he is in his agricultural jungle, sharing himself pushing in a side lane or otherwise concerned."}

If you look to fight when it\u2019s down, you will be an easy target and die quite fast.\n\nIf you\u2019re ahead, look for picks or ambush the enemy as they walk through their jungle.

{"text": "As ivern, Ivern doesn\u2019t deal damage and is built as a secondary Support. This means he relies on his teammates more than most Junglers in the game.\n\nHe is best paired with a team that has a hyper carry.

Do not fight or skirmish with the enemy until they\u2019re both up. Getting killed could cost you the game.\n\nPlay on the side of the map that has the next major objective up so you can rotate to take it with your team. Alternatively, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the map and use it to get to your team."}
{"text": "As zoe, Her early laning is lackluster and she can be exploited quite easily due to the lack of mobility in her kit.\n\nMissing her E will make her vulnerable, especially before she hits level six. This will make her really weak against any enemy who has a dash or blink in their kit.\n\nQuite vulnerable to ganks when she is pushed up and has no spell picked up due to her W. Once crowd controlled, she has no form of escape as her Ultimate R will just blink her back to the original recast location."}
{"text": "As zac, He can continue to gain part of his health in a fight by collecting his W blobs. This makes it very difficult for his enemies to kill him easily, which makes him concentrate first of all completely useless. His passive and ultimate R can allow him to take on alone a group of enemies of a major team fight, by simply zoning them. He can also inflict a lot of damage to the enemy rear line if they ignore Zac."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, He is a mage, so any form of silence or channel interruption spell is his weakness. This is especially true if someone manages to interrupt his Ultimate R, as that is the ability that can single-handedly turn the tide of a team fight.\n\nGrievous Wounds are quite effective against him. He is quite squishy as well so he won\u2019t be able to do much if the enemy team gets healing reduction during the early game.\n\nHis biggest weakness is an enemy team that can ward well. This will legitimately counter Fiddlesticks entirely and will prevent him from all-inning the enemy team consistently. The vision will allow the enemy to anticipate his move and react accordingly."}
{"text": "As karma, Karma's poke is really heinous for the enemy team during the middle of the game. It also provides a lot of utility due to its d and d. It simply means that a good Karma will make his team invincible. At level 9, Karma will have his Q maximd. This increases his overall damage to poke and will leave his enemies in pieces before significant fighting. Level 11 will be a decent peak of power due to his empowerment potential. This will come in real practice during major battles in the objective pits."}

Let the wave push in so you can safely close. Only push the wave in if you decide to roll around and help your sideways. Once you get your ultimate R, your all-in frequency should increase massively. You will want to use your W to get closer to the enemy and then use your Q and Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against diana, Once Diana reaches level 6, she can start receiving ganks from her Jungler as her Ultimate R deals a lot of damage and is CC. With this in mind, try to monitor the river and side bushes to spot the enemy Jungler before they appear in your way. Every time Diana lands her Q, she could look for all-in thanks to the reset on her t. Try and play safer when her Q landed and wait for him to disappear before walking forward. Diana is rather weak if she doesn't get killed early."}
{"text": "As pantheon, He will fall off later during the game due to the enemy purchasing defensive items. He should still rely on picks to get kills all around the map.\n\nLevel 16 isn't that great a spike as it will only increase the damage of the ability and reduce the cooldown.\n\nPantheon is pretty tanky in the late game and can dish out tons of damage as well. His E and W allow him to quickly pick off targets without taking damage in return."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, Don't fight Miss Fortune and her team inside the jungle as her Ultimate e will cover all the way that will allow her to inflict tons of damage on your entire team. As soon as Miss Fortune channels her Ultimate e, try to cancel it by CC. If you can cancel it quickly, its release of damage will be very low.

Another point in his Ultimate l will let him use the ability frequently and increase the clone burst damage.        "}
{"text": "Against zac, His early play is rather weak, but killing him can be difficult. Expect him to focus on agriculture rather than fighting in the game very early.

Once Zac hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his death pressure increases."}

Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "As garen, At level 9, Garen will have his first maximum ability. This is a decent power peak as it allows him to easily dull enemies and go for regular short burst trades. Once he manages to get 2 points in his Ultimate R, he will have an effortless time catching the out-of-guard enemies and killing them. He should use the track brushes to go for regular short burst trades. His survival is remarkable during the middle of the game, and he can run the enemies down while peeling for his wears.

Combined with the R speed, he is relatively hard to kill during the early game unless he completely pushed up.\n\nUnlocking his Ultimate R gives him a huge power spike.

He doesn\u2019t have to roam too far for this, so he can get back to the lane quickly if the all-in chance disappears.\n\nHis Ultimate R knockup prevents the enemy team from playing in a clustered formation as that could literally get them killed within the next 2.5 seconds. His W plays a pivotal role during team fights in such situations."}
{"text": "As ashe, You need to focus on initiating fights with its Ultimate w from now on. It will allow your team to follow the CC, while the shortcut means that getting high priority peaks will be extremely easy. You will do a lot of damage during this phase of the game as well. You will act as a secondary ADC for its team, but you should focus on spamming there to soften the enemies before entering for a murder. Positioning will mean a lot to you during this phase of the game. You can do everything you want to do while remaining in the backline and deal with the closest enemy to you as you are really motionless."}
{"text": "As nilah, Your Ultimate will be on a short cooldown, so ensure that you use it quite frequently. It will definitely help you with chunking out enemies.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target.\n\nJust like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone as you will die easily.\n"}
{"text": "As seraphine, Level 3 is a massive spike as she has all her abilities at her disposal during this game phase. She can use them quite effectively if she uses the lane brushes.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent powerspike as Seraphine will get her Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is stacked together or is standing in a line. It also helps during neutral, objective fights.\n\nThe first item component increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a bit more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will need to be careful about spamming spells."}
{"text": "As yone, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Look to stack your Tear as often as possible. The earlier you get it, the better.\n\nHarass and poke the enemy as often as you can with your Q. Slowly whittle the enemy down with your Q will increase your chances of winning a followup fight.\n\nBack early once you have enough gold for your first item. Usually, Ezreal will want to recall once he has enough gold for Tear."}
{"text": "As diana, Try to flank in team fights with your Q and t to get on to the enemy backline and shut them down. Flank from the side instead of running directly towards the enemy as they\u2019ll be able to disengage or poke you down.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nAvoid overextending or dying alone. When you\u2019re dead, the enemy may be able to siege an objective, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "As brand, Use your early game strength to poke and harass the enemy with your W as often as you can. \n\nPost level 3, you\u2019ll be able to use your basic combo to chunk the enemy down. When trading keep an eye on your mana bar though as you\u2019ll be vulnerable when you\u2019re out of mana.\n\nAt level 6 your kill pressure increases dramatically. Try to play aggressive and look for kills. Make sure the enemy is infected with Blaze so it deals more damage."}
{"text": "As leblanc, Her first power peak of LeBlanc is at level two. Her combo Q, W should be enough to cut the health bar of the enemy laner. Her next power peak is at level three when she gets access to her E. Combined with her first Q, W combo, and Ignite, she can literally kill someone at level three. Getting her Ultimate R is Leblanc's next major power peak. She can now wander and repeat her combo W, R, W to kill her laner."}
{"text": "As camille, You should always save your Jungler while they are busy invading. Look to flank and remove the enemies, or choose them with your Ultimate. This can be pretty easy on the enemy Support, or Mid Lane enemy if they overextend. Buy items that will keep you alive longer in team fighting. Try to be as heinous as possible: soak up and inflict damage to advance your team."}
{"text": "Against aurelionsol, Don\u2019t all in Aurelion at level 1 when he has Corrupting Potions. He is going to heal up a lot and deal surprising damage when trading back with you.\n\nWhile not always practical, once Aurelion hits level 3 he will unlock his main roaming ability. Ping as soon as he goes missing as it is not unheard of Aurelion roaming to bot lane at level 3.\n\nWhen Aurelion hits level 6, he will try and make good use of his Ultimate. If he cannot kill you in lane, he\u2019ll make sure to use it elsewhere. Once his Ultimate is up and he\u2019s gone, communicate with your team. "}
{"text": "As camille, In the late game, Camille is good at picking off champions with her Ultimate R. It should be on a low cooldown and if you\u2019re able to Ult R the right champion (like a carry), you could win the game.\n\nWhile you have good pick potential, the enemy will start building defensive stats which will make it harder for you to kill the carries on your own. Keep this in mind when diving in with your E.\n\nAlthough you will find it harder to kill carries on your own, you will be quite tanky and deal a lot of damage thanks to the items you buy. Don\u2019t be afraid to jump in and soak up damage if you need to."}
{"text": "As darius, Make sure you're close to your team at all times so you can fight quickly. Peel for your allies and keep them alive as long as possible, but make sure you're close to the neutral goal in neutral goal fights. In a standard team fight, if you're forward, try to take the back of the enemy. If you're not strong, use your Fear e to peel for your allies. Stay with your team in the late match. Do not separate or leave them otherwise the enemy can try to withdraw or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team."}
{"text": "As trundle, Trundle is decent enough during the late part because it will have its articles and will be very tanky. Its damage production should be quite high as well. A maximum of Ultimate n will allow Trundle to take control of the fighting in an easy way. It can quickly become tankier or inflict more damage depending on the enemy it uses the Ultimate n on. Trundle is perfect during the team fights. It will allow him to quickly blow up squishy enemies and slow their escape/advances. His e et e should help his team and him a lot."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, His e will be maxed out at level 9. This is horrible for group-up enemy teammates who can easily target his e and melt down.\n\nLevel 11 allows Kog'Maw to deal a lot of poke damage to the enemies. The vast range also allows him to take down low-health enemies recalling in the distance.\n\nHe will be perfect during the mid-game, provided he doesn't get collapsed on and shut down. CC is his worst enemy, and Kog'Maw will have to keep an eye on his flanks at all times.        "}
{"text": "As skarner, His tankess is really high during this phase of the game. This should allow him to absorb a lot of damage and be a very effective front line for his team. At level 16, Skarner will put the third and final point in his Ultimate. This will put his Ult on a pretty short cooldown. During this stage, your best bet will be to stay with your team because you will really tanky and can play a vital role to keep your team alive."}
{"text": "Against rell, When you play as a varied champion, try your hardest to intimidate Rell when she walks forward. If you can keep her low, she will be unable to engage or play aggressively. Every time she is disassembled W, you should look to play aggressively and bring her down. She is very vulnerable and has nothing to stop you from doing it. Once Rell reaches Level 6, her Ultimate R is a very versatile tool that can allow her to turn around the exchanges. Under no circumstances should you try to dive her position 6."}
{"text": "Against vayne, Vayne is incredibly weak in the beginning of the game. Try to abuse it if you can. Finish the game as fast as possible. Vayne is a monster of the end of the game and will be incredibly hard to kill in the end of the game."}
{"text": "Against shaco, If your team is grouped and you have no vision on Shaco, make sure you have a Sweeping Lens and vision surrounding you, so you will be alerted if Shaco tries to jump in and assassinate a carry.\n\nDo not chase Shaco as he may be baiting you into running into his Boxes x or towards his team.\n\nShaco will try to assassinate squishy targets that are moving around the map alone. You can prevent this by playing as a team and by avoiding walking in unwarded areas if you don\u2019t know where he has been."}
{"text": "As swain, Bait out his E before attempting to engage if possible.\n\nHis level 6 power spike is stronger, granting him additional survivability against all-ins. So you need to keep this in mind when fighting him.\n\nGet healing reduction items to mitigate his sustain in fights.\n\nLet him push to potentially set up for ganks from your jungler."}
{"text": "As veigar, Level 3 is a decent peak of power because Veigar can trap his enemies and peel them with his abilities. A complete rotation of his basic abilities will cause a good amount of damage to his target. Level 6 is a significant peak of power because Veigar gets access to his Ultimate R, which is a very great finishing movement. He will help him take the game later. The first element will be a significant peak of power as well. That's because his AP will be increased, which, combined with his passive, will allow him to have more AP than most other players."}
{"text": "Against nunu, Nunu\u2019s roaming can be really hard to deal with. Ping as soon as he goes missing as he will be looking to help his allies.\n\nAt level 6, Nunu can go for aggressive all-ins on you if he is able to knock you up with his W.\n\nNunu can be really good in team fights in the mid-game if he is able to pick someone off with his W."}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen\u2019s early game is quite strong. Expect him to play aggressively and try to burst you down. Staying at max distance when your abilities are on cooldown will make it harder for him to kill you.\n\nPlaying around Shen\u2019s taunt E will make the laning phase much easier for you. If you can bait this ability out, you have a period of time where you can play aggressive and force him to lose lots of health.\n\nPost 6, if he uses his Ultimate R to assist another lane, try to cancel it with a CC ability. If you can\u2019t cancel the ability, ping and push the minion wave into his tower as quickly as you can. "}
{"text": "Against viego, Try and use your range advantage to bully and harass Viego whenever he walks up to farm. He is a melee champion who can easily be bullied by ranged champions.\n\nViego will find it difficult to kill you in lane if you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will give him less room to manoeuvre.\n\nMake sure there is a minion between you and him at all times. This will make it impossible for him to CC you with his W."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Trading against Heimerdinger can be extremely tedious, yet it can be done. Taking down his Turrets Q will be the main focus in order to poke or trade with him.\n \nWhen using your skills shots (if they\u2019re AOE), try and aim them so they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q. This will make it easier for you to clear them down the line and increase your kill pressure in lane.\n \n Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, his kill pressure and strength increase dramatically. Keep this in mind and beware of his empowered abilities."}
{"text": "As brand, The brand has a lot of poke with its W with the added advantage of being long-range as well. This allows it to poke the enemy from afar and to make them low. It has really good clear wave and AOE thanks to its W. It is good for the brand because it can constantly push the wave and keep the enemy rolling in their turn. Its Ultimate R is really good in team fights- especially if the enemy are grouped. It can bounce its Ultimate R between enemies and do a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As olaf, Continue to pick up and secure the jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall back into the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure to continue growing! When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. After getting a murder, make the call for Baron or Dragon if your team is nearby and able to help you."}
{"text": "As ziggs, During the late game, you will function mainly as a siege-based mage. Focus on taking towers quickly and open up the map. This will make it really easy for you to control the game state.\n\nBeing full build will let you blow up enemies with ease. All you need to do is combo them properly with your W, E, and Ultimate R. This strategy is best used in neutral, objective fights.\n\nUse the fog of war to catch enemies off-guard. You can work with your Support and the Jungler to set up death brushes for the enemies."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Use your Q & E to target both enemies and minions simultaneously to use your mana effectively. Do not spam these capabilities either, as you will lack mana quickly. Once you get your first component, you should be able to spam capabilities much more frequently. Now you can look for aggressive trades with your Q & E. Getting your Ultimate R will be a big turn in the game. You can use it sololy, but the best use will be during intertwined fighting."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, At level 16, Fiddlesticks will put the third and final point in his Ultimate R. As long as he can get the channel off, he will be very good in the late game.\n\nTeams will continue to group in the late game. This will allow Fiddlesticks to get a lovely amount of damage down to the whole enemy team.\n\nWhile you\u2019re good in the late game, you\u2019re incredibly squishy. Lookout and be cautious when trying to get a good Ultimate R off so you don\u2019t get killed before a fight breaks out."}
{"text": "As azir, Azir does not have a peak at level 11 unlike many champions. Keep this in mind during the middle of the game that his Ultimate R can be less impacted compared to the other champions on the flaw. At level 9, Azir goes to max his r. It is a good peak of power for him because he can use it to bring down the enemy from afar. In conjunction with his W, he should be able to poke and farm from afar without dying to the enemy. When Azir completes several articles, he will be very strong and deposit a lot of damage in a short time."}
{"text": "As drmundo, You should look for early duels with Dr.Mundo, as your E will always give you an upper hand in this matchup. Amplify the dueling potential with a Grievous Wounds item.\t\n\nYour Passive should let you detect Dr.Mundo with ease. This will be really helpful when it comes to letting your teammates know about Dr.Mundo's whereabouts. It will also let you deep ward the enemy jungle safely.\t\n\nYou should have an easy time trying to gank enemies with your E as it can allow you to catch them off-guard and burst them down. Just make sure that Dr.Mundo is not nearby; else, you may not be able to pull off the gank successfully.\t\n\nDuring team fights, always try to target the enemy backline and kill at least one enemy's carries. It will also let your team deal with Dr.Mundo efficiently should he decide to go in solo."}
{"text": "As udyr, His Ultimate R doesn\u2019t really give him any form of a power spike. His overall playstyle still remains the same, and he can be taken down easily if he overextends.\n\nVery dependent on mana, so if someone manages to steal his Blue Buff, he will have a really hard time spamming his abilities and killing someone.\n\nIf Udyr has his E on Cooldown, or if he used it with his Flash to stun someone, he will have no form of escape and can be killed if crowd control is layered on him."}
{"text": "As leblanc, Her core items should allow her to blow up any squishy target she sets her eyes upon. She should roam around and see if she can get kills on overextended side laners.\n\nThe optimal time to go in during skirmishes will be when the enemy has their targeted CC ability down. This way, they won't be able to CC Leblanc when she uses her W to dash in.\n\nHer level eleven power spike is quite potent as well. She will now deal more damage with her burst combo. Hiding in the fog of war and trying to blow enemies up will be her power play style."}
{"text": "As zeri, Ensure that you have mid-priority at all times in this game. It will let you rotate and help your teammates very easily.\n\nYour charged attacks are your bread and butter in this matchup. Always try to clear the wave with your Q while you save your auto-attack for the enemy.\n\nSince you are so mobile, you may feel that you can chase enemies down. Try not to do so without any form of Ability Haste, as your E has a massive cooldown early on.    "}
{"text": "As nidalee, Nidalee is really good at counter jungling and stealing camps away from the enemy Jungler. This allows her to get ahead while putting the enemy behind.\n\nHas good objective control. This enables her to secure the Dragon with ease. She can also take the Rift Herald alone and fast!\n\nNidalee is a strong skirmisher and duelist. This makes her a pain to deal with for the enemy. As long as she can dodge CC (or wait for the enemy to use a key ability first) and land her s, she should win most 1v1s."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar cannot roam as much as other laners. He also is unable to follow the majority of roams due to his low 1v1 potential.\n\nWhile his Ultimate R is on cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable to all-in.\n\nWhile you\u2019re channelling your Ultimate R, you will be stood still. This can allow an untargeted champion to fight or kill you. This is a common downfall of your Ultimate R in mid and late game team fights- especially against hard engage teams. "}
{"text": "As sett, His ultimate R allows him both to obtain tanks from his aircraft carriers and to inflict a lot of damage on the enemy team if he manages to ulterate his target on them. This can change the tide of a team struggle in an instant. His passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so that he can resort to short operations against the enemy champions unlike the other tanks. His W makes such high misleading damage, while at the same time providing him with a mitigation of the damage."}
{"text": "Against swain, At level 6, Swain\u2019s damage output and survivability increases. You shouldn\u2019t commit to a fight with him unless you can burst him down quickly as his Ultimate R will offer him extra protection and health regeneration.\n\nSwain\u2019s early game is abusable as he is really weak early on. Once the mid-game hits, you\u2019ll have to play more respectable.\n\nHe is really good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Bursting him down at the start of the fight will make it difficult for him to deal damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "As teemo, He can roam around the map and place his Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow him to detect enemies as well as get kills on unsuspecting low health targets.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let him deal hefty amounts of burst damage and will let him kill his enemies quickly.\n\nHe isn't outstanding in team fights, so he should either resort to securing picks and blowing people up with his abilities or just split pushing till the enemy responds to him.        "}
{"text": "As twitch, Look for extended trades early. Twitch\u2019s damage in the very early game is quite strong if he can get a long extended trade down.\n\nAfter he picks up his first component item, Twitch\u2019s trading power increases dramatically. He will be a huge problem for the enemy if he can sneak up on them with his s.\n\nAt level 6, Twitch can go for scarier trades with the enemy. The extra stats he gets from his Ultimate c will help him get kills with his ADC.\n"}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Blitzcrank\u2019s level 2 is very strong. Landing a Hook b on the enemy Support or ADC and knocking them up with your t could result in an early kill.\n\nWhen Blitz has picked up his Boots, he can start roaming around the map and help his allies. Look to roam after purchasing and upgrading your Boots.\n\nAt level 6, Blitzcrank can start to deal a lot of burst damage if he can land his b. His Ultimate d can also be beneficial and destroying shields in clutch 2v2 fights in the bottom lane."}
{"text": "Against soraka, Soraka can prevent an all-in by placing her Silence E on herself as soon as you engage. Try to bait the Silence E out before looking for the all-in.\n\nTo increase your kill pressure in a Soraka matchup, focus the Soraka rather than the ADC. Focusing the ADC will not be helpful as Soraka can just heal them with her W. \n\nIf you benefit from it, try to get an early Executioner\u2019s Calling. This will reduce her healing ability and increase your kill pressure in lane."}
{"text": "As lucian, Heavy power spike at level two which allows him to run an enemy down with his E, Q combo. This combined with his Passive and Summoner Spells may easily get him a kill on a squishy target.\n\nReally good wave clear with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This causes him to gain priority really fast and it also helps him secure objectives with his Jungler.\n\nPost-six, he can practically one shot an enemy with his combo while simultaneously re-positioning with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to evade ganks with ease."}
{"text": "As zyra, Zyra\u2019s will have good early game poke, especially after level 4 when she has 2 point in her Q.\n\nAt level 6, Zyra can deal a considerable amount of burst damage to the enemy. Her kill pressure increases dramatically at this stage of the game.\n\nWhen Zyra has completed her Mythic item, her damage output and poke in lane will be very high. Her goal at this stage is just to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As syndra, Level 16 is a massive spike for her as she can decimate squishy enemies. It will allow her to take down core enemy teammates.\n\nShe will have most of her abilities maxed out during this phase of the game. This means that she will be a lingering threat wherever she goes. The enemy will have to invest heavily in Magic Resistance.\n\nSyndra will have many items during this phase of the game, which will directly translate into damage for her. Her ability to dish out a lot of damage will keep the enemy on their toes."}
{"text": "As kassadin, If your team is good in team fights, stay with them. If your team is not in advance or not very strong, you could try to divide the thrust and attract the attention of enemies while your team sits a goal elsewhere or does the Baron. Kassaddin is very good to get choices thanks to its Ultimate k. Look for choices in the late part to get your team before."}
{"text": "Against vayne, Vayne will be often left alone to split push and farm. While she\u2019s away from her team, you could look to collapse on her and take her down. Do not commit multiple players to killing her though if she\u2019s bot side and the Baron\u2019s up.\n\nVayne is prone to CC. Locking her down at the start of the fight will make it incredibly difficult for her to kite, deal damage and win the team fight.\n\nPlaying around her Ultimate n  will be a great way of increasing your chances of killing Vayne in a team fight. Forcing a team fight one after another will decrease her chances of surviving in the next one."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Do not group closely together when sieging an objective or team fighting as it provides Gragas with an opportunity to knock your whole team into his with his Ultimate R.\n\nWhen fighting, make sure you\u2019re not too far forward or split from your team. If you\u2019re too far forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught out like this could result in the enemy taking an objective shortly afterwards. \n\nTry to constantly poke and harass Gragas. Having him on low health will prevent him from playing or positioning aggressively."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes a lot of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You have to play a lot to make use of her kit. While Camille is incredibly mobile thanks to her E, every time he is on the cooldown, she is very vulnerable and easy to take. Before entering, make sure to check your environment as you do not have an escape when your E is down. As it is mechanically difficult, it is really easy to get wrong on her. If you make a mistake, the enemy can easily capitalize on her and win an advance. Once Camille is behind it, it will be difficult for her to return to the game."}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz is strong at level 3 and 4 once he unlocks the 3 of his abilities. He should play a little more safely until he reaches 3 or 4 and then look for an aggressive all-in-one. Fizz's main power peak is once he reaches level 6. His Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool that can help him get killed easily. He has a short cooling time so he can play aggressively again and again. Once Fizz has recalled and picked up his first article, he will be able to drop out of a lot of damage quite quickly. A good Fizz will not be afraid to go for aggressive parts especially if he has a better first article than his opponent of the track."}
{"text": "Against olaf, In team fighting, Olaf will seek to isolate and remove the highest value target using its k. Make sure that the strongest members of your team cannot be engaged by positioning themselves safely. Olaf loses both armor and magic resistance when it activates its Ultimate k. If possible, focus it while it is in its most vulnerable state before it can cause damage."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Remember that this is an AoE capability. Therefore, you should try to hit as many targets as possible with it. Once you get your base objects, the burn damage of your Ultimate y and e will be quite unbearable for the enemy team. Just make sure that you are properly positioned during the attack of the enemy. During neutral combats, goals, make sure that you are as far away from the enemies as possible. That said, make sure that your e and Ultimate cover the essential bottlenecks there."}
{"text": "As irelia, Three points in her Ultimate R will give her a peak of massive power. Then, with a short cooling, she will take more fighting and easily choose enemies in the side tracks. At this point, due to her articles, Irelia will be extremely tanky and will do tons of damage. The amount of damage she inflicts will catch most of the out-of-guard enemies, especially if she manages to flank the enemy. Irelia is particularly good in the fighting, specifically the fighting that occurs around the choking points."}
{"text": "As lillia, She will be able to maximize her Ultimate R at level 16. This will have a significant impact on team fighting since her Ultimate R will be on a very short cooldown. Lillia is excellent in team fighting at the end of the game. This is due to her AoE abilities and mobility, which can allow her to get a 5-man Ultimate R. Lillia will now have several articles."}
{"text": "As neeko, Great pick potential with her E especially when the target is hiding behind their minion wave. Her Q provides for a good amount of wave clear which helps her get lane priority.\n\nExtremely useful in team fights due to her Ultimate R CC and damage. This allows her team to play around her and her Jungler to gank her.\n\nHer Passive combined with her Ultimate R can be a deadly combo. If she goes AD, she can run any enemy down if they don\u2019t have some form of CC ability on them."}
{"text": "As swain, Excellent CC channel if he or someone else on his team gets to CC a target. This works especially well against motionless door. You can follow with your E (press it twice) and shoot the enemy closer. Can regenerate a lot of health with his W and thus surpass his enemies in the way. His ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective in fighting in closed spaces. He can use his W to set up ganks for his Jungler too. This allows him to catch up with his target while providing a vision of the area. The last part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, You should spend a lot of time escaring and accumulating an advance during this phase of the game. Your main target is the enemy backline so try to get on them. Flanks and the war fog are your friends in this game. Always try to use the war fog to reach the enemy backline and allow your allies to follow your engagement. Fighting around the bottlenecks will be really useful. Make sure you don't do anything to get caught and use your Ultimate n to hit multiple enemies simultaneously."}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu\u2019s late game is not bad. He will be very tanky as he would be coming towards the end of his build. If he hasn\u2019t gone full tank, his damage output will be quite good in late game team fights.\n\nAt level 16, Amumu will put the third and final point in his Ultimate y. His Ultimate y should be on a short cooldown and he should have it up somewhat frequently. Avoid fighting unless it\u2019s up in the late game.\n\nTeams will still be grouped closely together in the late game. This is good for Amumu as he will be able to CC his whole team with his Ultimate y."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Avoid regrouping too closely otherwise, Lissandra will be able to engage with her E and land on a multi-person W. If you can, try to separate slightly so that she can only hit 1 or 2 champions to the maximum. Play around Lissandras Ultimate R cooldown. Once he's on cooldown, she's rather vulnerable and can't fight as a team properly. You can use this to your advantage to force team fights when you know it. Lissandra has tons of clear wave, so the nap targets in the middle and the end of the game will be difficult. Keep this in mind and try to take her down or push her off the track so she can't defend her Turrets."}
{"text": "As amumu, The enemy has pretty good objective control. With this in mind, try and keep it warded at all times with a Control Ward in the back of the pit. This will help your team know if they start the objective and if you\u2019re nearby, you might be able to collapse onto them.\n\nYou\u2019re much stronger than the enemy in the 1v1. So if you find them walking around the map or near the scuttle crab, you can fight them as long as you have a lot of health. Make sure you check the map for collapsing laners and back off if they come. If the enemy lands their CC, just back off.\n\nAs discussed, the enemy needs to hit level 6 quickly to make full use of their kit. Try to invade them as much as possible and steal away their camps to delay their level 6 power spike. A good time to invade is when the enemy Jungler shows on the opposite side of the map.\n\nThe enemies level 6 power spike is incredibly strong. Once they hit it, they will be ganking as often as their Ultimate is up. Make sure you place vision inside their jungle so you can spot them before they gank."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Powerfarm in the middle of the game. You have to win as much gold and XP as possible so you can level quickly. Avoid fighting too much in the middle of the game. It is better for you to fight only when it will work in your favor. Focus on agriculture rather than fighting."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton's first item component will help him massively with his laning. His dueling power should increase quite decently now.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike for Renekton as he gains his Ultimate t now. It will allow him to initiate all-ins and zone the enemy off during neutral, objective fights.\n\nRenekton is quite a solid early game champion. His ability to duel enemies and impact neutral objective fights is massive and should allow his team to dominate during the early game."}
{"text": "As rakan, Level 16 is another decent peak where he can use his Ultimate R a lot. The enemy team will always have to look at their flanks. Rakan is excellent during the end-of-game fights that his W, E, and Ultimate R will be on very short cooldowns. He will have to use the fog of the war whenever possible. Rakan is pretty powerful during the end of the game. That's because he can take enemies constantly because of his abilities on short cooldowns and be able to escape quickly."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. When you hit level 6, ask for help from your Jungler to kill the enemy lantern."}
{"text": "As kaisa, When she is paired with all-in-one champions, she will be good in the all-in-one game. Her level 6 power peak is quite useful. She can use her Ultimate R to reposition, engage and disengage from fighting, and protect herself."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Three points in his Ultimate e will give him a massive peak of power. The ability will spread a lot of damage and have a very short cooldown, so that team fights will be frequent. His life flying combined with his damage and mobility during the end of the game will make him really good in team fights. She will just need to maintain an appropriate positioning. She will have several articles during this phase of the game. It will allow him to ridicul tons of damage and a squishy champion blow."}
{"text": "As nautilus, On getting 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will use the ability quite often. Team fights will be a breeze for him from now on.\n\nHis ability to make the team fights unfair due to his pick potential will be quite apparent during this game phase. All he needs to do is Ultimate e his enemy from out of vision.\n\nHis tankiness will know no bounds during this phase of the game. He will soak up both tower shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow up on his engagement."}
{"text": "Against rengar, Rengar will try to cheese at level 1. Do not walk into lane unless he is spotted overwise he will jump out on you from a bush.\n\nHe is really good after the laning phase has ended as he can get picks with his Ultimate R. Avoid walking around Summoners Rift alone otherwise he may try to catch you out of position.\n\nStanding towards the bottom side of the lane at all times will make laning against Rengar easier. Avoid standing near the bushes as he will be able to jump out of them."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan IV will be unlocking his d > e combo at level two, which will allow him to catch and CC overextended enemies with utmost ease. This will also let him show extreme prowess during Jungle duels.\n\nJarvan's first item component will give him a massive boost to his dueling and survivability. He will now be able to put his d Passive to good use, especially if he manages to catch an enemy out on his own.\n\nJarvan IV will unlock the ability to completely separate an enemy out from their team and lock them down at level 6. It is incredibly beneficial when the main goal is to separate out a single target and get rid of them quickly."}

If she uses any abilities on the minion wave to last hit with, make sure you abuse the cooldowns.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about Anivia\u2019s Passive. It has a long cooldown, so once it\u2019s been popped, make sure you try to kill her while she is most vulnerable. Call for assistance and ask for ganks while it\u2019s down.\n\nTry and hold off from using any dashes that can help you dodge skill shots.

{"text": "As vladimir, Another point in his Ultimate e will allow him to dish out a lot of AoE burst damage and use the ability quite frequently.\n\nVladimir is perfect during mid-game fights. He should accumulate a lead during this phase of the game by bursting enemies down with his Q and Ultimate e.\n\nHe is terrific in team fights due to his Q , E, and Ultimate e. If the enemy is clumped up, Vladimir will decimate them with his Ultimate e.        "}

Disengage as soon as Neeko walks forward and tries to engage to minimize the usefulness of her Ultimate R.\n\nWard your flanks and nearby bushes when sieging objectives as Neeko may use her Passive and W to get a good engage off with her Ultimate R.\n\nSplitting up and not standing too close together will help reduce how many people Neeko and stun with her Ultimate R. Group when team fighting, but don\u2019t stand too close together."}
{"text": "As neeko, Your champion is weak in the early game. Avoid fighting until you have quite a few levels behind you. Once you have an item and some levels under your belt, you can look for skirmishes with the enemy.\n\nFocus on farming and picking up as much farm as possible in the early game. This will make you more of a threat in the later parts of the game.\n\nRotate and move around the map if your bot lane decides to rotate to the top lane after securing the bottom lane tower."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies ahead. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure you try to exploit your early advantage.\n\nLook to secure objectives whenever they\u2019re up. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes along.\n\nFind a healthy balance between ganking your allies, farming your jungle and securing objectives. Make sure you do not fall behind in XP by trying to constantly gank."}
{"text": "As taric, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As pyke, If you miss your Ultimate R, you will miss potential resets and you will definitely miss the gold and damage. Try your hardest to know who has Flash and who does not increase your chances of landing your Q. It is a mechanically difficult champion to learn and will take a lot of time to get used to. Expect to put in a lot of work trying to learn it. Unfortunately, Pyke has nothing to offer when her Q is down."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Start focusing on the enemy backline from now on. It should be effortless for you to do so as long as you are in the fog of the war and have a defensive element like a Zhonya Hurglass. Your Ultimate R} will have a very short cooldown. This simply means that you can often fight around the map. Make sure you participate in neutral and objective battles as well."}
{"text": "Against shen, Look out for an aggressive level 1 play. They can easily try and take you down if you overstep.\n\nTry your hardest to poke and harass the enemy, but don\u2019t over commit to it as they can turn around an exchange easily.\n\nThe enemies level 6 isn\u2019t very strong in 2v2 fights as their Ultimate R is a utility tool.. With this in mind, use your level 6 advantage to play aggressive and take them down."}
{"text": "As sion, An additional point in his Ultimate R will increase his overall damage and allow him to use the ability frequently. He will help him massively during team fighting or trying to secure peaks. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be respectable enough now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability by hiding in a brush. His tankness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will absorb the turn shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow his commitments."}
{"text": "As qiyana, She has tons of combos to master. This makes her a mechanically difficult champion to play and do well. Expect to put in a lot of games to control her. According to her Element, she can be a less effective laner. The enemy will always know which Element you have and they will be able to play around him. Also, having a certain Element may not be useful in the way. If Qiyana is behind, she will not do any harm in team fighting."}
{"text": "As gragas, Gragas will be looking to gank frequently in the early game. Try to equal his pressure by ganking frequently too. If you can\u2019t gank, when he is on the opposite side of the map, try to invade the other side of his jungle to steal away his camps or take an objective.\n\nGragas can use his Bodyslam E to interupt your engage. With this in mind, wait for him to use his E before diving into him unless you can get the catch on to him.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate, it\u2019s key that you use it. Gank whenever you reach 6 and gank whenever your Ultimate is off cooldown. Every second with it up could mean you miss out on a kill. Get ahead of Gragas by ganking with your Ultimate every time it\u2019s up.\n\nYou can beat him in a 1v1 as long as you dodge his E.

{"text": "As vayne, The control of the crowd is its mortal enemy and its enemies can get rid of it as soon as it is controlled by the crowd. Very vulnerable in team fighting without its Ultimate n. It needs the invisibility to judge its enemies, otherwise it really can't do much more than completely rely on its team. It is very weak during the start of the game and can therefore easily be closed with constant ganks of the enemy team. Nor does its short range help it so that the enemy can easily camp this path."}
{"text": "Against shen, Expecting that he plays aggressively and tries to blow you up. Staying at a maximum distance when your abilities are on the cooldown will make it harder for him to kill you. Playing around Shen-S taunt E will make the laning phase much easier for you. If you can lure that ability, you have a period of time when you can play aggressive and force him to lose a lot of health. Post 6, if he uses his ultimate R to help another way, try to cancel it with a CC capability. If you can't cancel the ability, ping and push the minion wave into his tower as quickly as you can."}
{"text": "As gragas, Depending on your build, you will either be dealing tons of damage or tanking a lot of damage for your allies. Whatever be the case, remember that you still need to peel for your ADC.\n\nTry to work with your Jungler and get picks inside the enemy Jungle with your Ultimate R. Even picking off the enemy Support will grant your team a considerable advantage when it comes to vision placements.\n\nSet death brushes when possible and use your Ultimate R to bring unsuspecting enemies close to you. This will let your team collapse on them and kill them."}
{"text": "As lulu, Lulu can keep his allies alive for a long time with his E and Ultimate R in team fighting. This increases his ability to inflict damage and survive team fighting. You have a lot of poke thanks to your Q and E. This can allow you to win 1v1 battles with the enemy. You can also use your E to protect yourself rather than use it on the enemy. To tons of utility that can help him in a plethora of scenarios. Lulu is a solid choice and can fit into many team compositions."}
{"text": "As rammus, Rammus's first ganks are decent enough if the enemy is pushed up. He should be able to get his team quite before if he finds regular opportunities to do so.

He will just have to ensure that he uses it correctly (most fed target).\n\nZilean will have multiple items by now, which will allow him to deal a lot of damage and use his Ultimate t frequently. The shorter cooldowns will undoubtedly make life obnoxious for the enemy team.\n\nAt level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate t. This means that it will be more powerful and have a lower cooldown at the same time. This will be a massive spike for him. "}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, If Jarvan builds AD, he will be very squishy in the team fights and will get blown up quickly in the team fights. Once he has entered, he will have to engage fully in the fight. To ensure the victory, you must make sure that your team is able to follow. If you enter without them, you will die. Peel, disengagement and CC are the biggest weaknesses. He will be unable to effectively use his d and e combo if the enemy can bring him down, reposition or CC him mid-combo."}
{"text": "As zyra, At level 16, Zyra will put the final point in her Ultimate R. The utility and damage that this ability provides to this rank is very good, and it will be a threat in team fighting. Thanks to her weak cooling and plant plans, Zyra will help her team quickly get neutral goals such as the Baron or the Old Dragon. Don't be afraid to make the call for these goals if your team is able to do so."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Its Ultimate R should have an upgrade now. It will increase its overall efficiency in a fight, and the reduction of cooling time will help Gangplank win battles quickly.

{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus will be looking to split push throughout the mid-game. He is good at split pushing thanks to his Q.\n\nWhen Nasus is split pushing, you can use the numbers advantage to start a team fight. While fighting, check the map and be keep an eye on Nasus. Be prepared to disengage if he\u2019s about to take a tower.\n\nIf Nasus is grouping for team fights, try to lock him down with CC so he is unable to get on to your carries and kill them with his Q and R."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Level 3 is a significant powerspike for Hecarim. He can look for easy all-ins on the enemy laner with his abilities. Going for short burst trades while using the lane brushes to drop vision on the enemy would be the best course of action.\n\nOnce Hecarim hits level 6, he can terrorize enemies with his flanking potential. It will allow Hecarim to completely isolate a target from their team and burst them down with the help of his team. His sustain will be pretty high as well (due to runes and life steal).\n\nThe first component will allow Hecarim to duel more reliably in this lane. His damage output will increase, and he can also take part in river fights and reach major fights before his laner."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, Malzahar is not very strong in early play and can be made weaker by destroying his passive shield every time he gets up. As soon as he gets it, pop the shield must play even safer. Malzahar will seek to push the wave constantly once he has an object. Avoid standing inside the minion wave at any time so that he can't sting and push at the same time. Once Malzahar reaches level 6, you will have to play more respectful than he will tend to get ganks once his Ultimate R is in place. Every time he has his Ultimate R up, make sure you have quarters in the river so you can spot the Jungler before they reach your path."}
{"text": "As aphelios, You should get at least one defensive element depending on the comp and nourished enemy team wearing as you will be a main target. Always keep an eye on your flanks and prioritize saving yourself. Do not let yourself be caught trying to cultivate a side track at this stage. Neutral goals are important at this stage so always try to stay close to the track where the goal is about to reproduce in the next few minutes. If you manage to find a choice on someone, do not hesitate to use your ultimate R to finish them. Your ultimate R cooldown should be low enough but do your best to save some Infernum rounds for a major fight."}

Keep this in mind, but be prepared to adapt.\n"}
{"text": "As irelia, At level 9, Irelia will be able to maximize her Q. Being her central damage ability, she will be able to surpass her enemies for days now. The maintenance will be pretty decent too. Once she manages to get an extra point in her Ultimate R, she will use the ability frequently in the way. This will allow her to take more skirmishes and win most duels in the game. Irelia is excellent at the skirmishes due to her mobility, the reduction of damage, and Ultimate R. Fighting in bottlenecks and objective pits will surely bring her forward in the game."}
{"text": "As tristana, The damage must be unbearable for the enemy team and you will be able to get killed easily. Your W is extremely important in this matchup so make sure you use it with extreme discretion. The goal is to make sure that you surround the card properly before using the ability. After six, you should have an easy time getting the people of you in the game. It can also be used as an end move after you have loaded your E on the enemy."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus's level 6 is an important peak of power as it can actually be duel properly with enemies now. It will give it a massive advantage when it deals with enemy travelers who are pushed up and run by it. Nasus is very weak early and can be bullied hard because of the absence of HP and batteries on his Q. Its main objective will be to cultivate and pile up until decimate the opposition during the later parts of the game. Nasus' first element will give him a boost in the way. It will bring him a step closer to reaching his most powerful form in the game, but it should always focus on agriculture and stack his Q."}

Make sure you hit level 2 at the same time which is the first wave followed by 1 melee minion on the second wave to reduce her ability to kill you.\n\nCassiopeia has mana issues in the early game. If she is low on mana, it could be a good time to fight her as her damage output will be heavily reduced as she relies heavily on mana to trade.\n\nShe is an immobile Mage with no escapes. Let her push the wave and then call for assistance from your Jungler to shut her down."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Focus on early farming. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.

Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's Ultimate R will really shine during this phase of the game because it can now impact team fighting whenever this ability is rising. Moreover, it really works well when its target is the one that has to approach the enemies to attack them. At level 9, its Q will be fully maximized. This will give a massive boost to its damage and clear wave. Moreover, it can now help other washers frequently and keep its wave shoved at all times. Galio will have its basic items at this stage. This is beneficial to him, and his team as its overall production of damage and survival will be higher."}

Use this to your advantage to win a level 6 all-in.\n\nYou should try to end the game as quickly as you can as Ryze becomes stronger and stronger as the game goes along.

{"text": "As diana, It should start to crash as soon as it reaches level three that its burst damage is relatively high, which will allow it to quickly get a Flash on the side of the enemy champions. The getting its Ultimate R will make it quite dangerous in the fights that occur around the bottlenecks. This helps its teammates a lot because they can easily collapse on the enemies Diana a Ultimate R'd. Its first element will allow it to get a massive increase in its overall damage. This will allow it to win duels with ease."}
{"text": "Against sett, Avoid grouping to closely as it may allow Sett to get a multi-person E off which will help his team win the team fight. Splitting up slightly will be better for you in the long run.\n\nDo not walk too far forward when sieging an objective as Sett may use his Ultimate R to pick up the closest champion and launch them into their allies behind them. If you\u2019re grouped together and in line with one another, it will be harder for him to do this. \n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, Sett will put himself in a side lane and try to split push.

Jax should try to divide the thrust and duel anyone if he is not too far behind. Jax main point comes when he reaches the late match and has several items in his inventory. So now he can actually 1 v 5 against the enemy team and get out on top.

A Refillable Potion wouldn\u2019t go amiss in this matchup.\n\nFor Utility Supports, take Relic Shield instead of Spellthief\u2019s as it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be able to stack this item effectively."}

You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Hard engagement is the best way to deal with Ezreal during the laning phase. But you will need to wait for him to use his E if your CC is a skill shot. Ezreals poke damage starts to stack if you take too many Qs in the face. Make sure you are still standing behind the minion wave at all times. In team fights, you must not let Ezreal fall before you have the chance to engage. If it is isolated, run on it as fast as you can to start the fight. Do not delay team fights against an Ezreal."}
{"text": "As syndra, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning. You need to poke the enemy down and delay fights in the late game, but you need to watch your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not get picked off by trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Stay mobile and keep a safe distance from Malzahar as much as possible to avoid getting caught by his ultimate. Use your E ability to create distance between you and Malzahar's voidlings if he tries to engage on you.\n\nTry to break Malzahar's spell shield before using your abilities, since it can negate a lot of your damage and crowd control effects. You can use your Q to do this right before a gank so that his shield is down and your Jungler can CC them quickly.\n\nKeep track of Malzahar's ultimate cooldown and maintain your distance from him when it is up. If an important ally is caught by it, use your Ultimate to CC him immediately.\n\nThe wave is to be kept in the middle of the lane to avoid Malzahar from sieging you to oblivion in this matchup. Just make sure that you don't stand too close to minions in this matchup."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 6 is a mediocre peak because it allows it to wander but does not provide it with anything else. This means that it will not allow it to play, but it still needs to land its basic abilities to do damage. The first component will allow it to spam the abilities and flatten a lot of damage to its enemies. It will be incredibly beneficial during the laning phase. Taliyah is relatively weak during early play because its track is shorter and can be easily wasted. Its Q reduces the track space where it can use the ability freely."}
{"text": "As xerath, The third point in his Ultimate 2 will allow Xerath to deal increased damage to enemies. The shot count will increase as well, giving Xerath more chances of hitting an enemy reliably.\n\nHe offers a lot of poke during the later parts of the game. This comes in handy before neutral objective fights, as the enemy team won't be able to all-in or contest that objective due to them being poked out.\n\nXerath is huge during team fights as his abilities can burst down multiple targets with a single cast. He will destroy the enemy if they happen to be clumped up together."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, In team fights, make sure no one on your team is too far forward as Malzahar may try and catch someone out of position with his Ultimate R.\n\nWhen sieging objectives or backing off from a fight, watch your positioning as you may walk into Malzahar\u2019s Q which can be devastating to your health bar.\n\nAs soon as Malzhar focuses a champion with his Ultimate R, try to CC him so the channel is cancelled."}
{"text": "As hwei, In the late game, you would have completed several elements and got a lot of levels under your belt. You will be strong in the late game, too. At level 16, you will have put the final point in your R, giving your R a shorter cooling time and increasing your chances of getting choices."}
{"text": "As malzahar, When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Don't stay just in the middle if you can't get anything done. After your bot track moved to the middle track, turn to the bot side of the card or somewhere on the map so you can keep closing and winning XP. Play around your ultimate R in the middle of the game. It's an incredibly strong tool that can help you get an advantage of killing. With the advantage of numbers, you can then make the call for Baron or seat a round nearby."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays.\n\nPush the wave and look for roaming opportunities. Lissandra is a very good roaming champion who can impact the map and assist her allies with ease. Post 6, try to push and roam. "}
{"text": "As evelynn, Power farm up to level 6 when you unlock your Ultimate R. Once Evelynn reaches level 6 it will become invisible and will be able to browse the map and esquive vision. Once your Ultimate R is at the top, try to assassinate targets that are alone or weak. This will increase your chances of snowball and win the game. Avoid fighting in the game very early. You need time to come online, so focus on agriculture and survive."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Heimerdinger can take goals very quickly in the late game thanks to his Turrets Q. Be ready to make the call for them as you can often cheese them for free. Look for picks with your E to start the fight. If you are capable of CC all the enemy team, you will give your team a good chance to win the game. Keep peeling for your allies to keep them alive in the fights. You are good to peel, so you should do it in the late game."}
{"text": "As hwei, He has a lot of AOE tools in his kit. This makes him excellent in team fights. Unlike some LoL champions, Hwei has integrated CC, which is useful when it comes to making games and getting choices. He has many abilities, making a unique and fun champion."}
{"text": "As zyra, Zyra's will have a good early play poke, especially after level 4 when she has 2 points in her Q. At level 6, Zyra can inflict a considerable amount of bursting damage to the enemy. Her death pressure increases considerably at this stage of the game. When Zyra finished her Mythic article, her damage yield and poke in the track will be very high. Her goal at this stage is just to harass and bring down the enemy."}
{"text": "Against sejuani, Once Sejuani hits level 6, her kill pressure increases dramatically as her Ultimate R is a great ganking tool. Expect her to gank whenever her Ultimate R is up.\n\nAs soon as Sejuani has completed her jungling item, it will be difficult for you to kill her as she will be rather tanky. Avoid fighting her at this time unless you have an advantage.\n\nSejuani is really good during the mid and late game as she can catch players out in a team fight with her Ultimate R. Watch your positioning so she cannot isolate you and start the team fight."}
{"text": "As ahri, You should focus more on roaming and killing overextended enemies whenever your Ultimate is up. When the Ultimate  is not up, just focus on shoving your wave but don't overextend while doing that.\n\nTry swapping to a side lane as soon as you can. It will allow you to chase enemies more easily with your Ultimate  and E. Securing picks during this stage will make it easier for your team to obtain neutral objectives.\n\nDuring fights, always try to get to the enemy backline by flanking them from out of vision. A Sweeper may help you with that. If you can't do so, just keep chipping on the enemy frontline, till you can catch someone out with your E."}
{"text": "As zed, His W can help him escape or close the gap between him and his targets. When it comes to glove, it's a great way to close the gap. Zed has a good all-in-one potential and is very strong when he unlocks his Ultiamte R. However, Zed can start to glove from level 3. Zed has a healthy and fast clear thanks to his W that will help him inflict more damage to the camp when he is combined with his Q and E."}
{"text": "As sett, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting without it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "Against aatrox, Use the minion wave to block Aatrox from landing his W and going for the all-in. Always ensure that there is at least one minion between you and him at all times. \n \nBoth his Q and E have rather long cooldowns in the early game. If he uses them, try to abuse the cooldowns and trade with him while they\u2019re down.\n \nAatrox benefits from bursty trades with his Q. Try and keep your distance at all times and be prepared to sacrifice a little bit of CS, so he doesn\u2019t burst you down."}
{"text": "As aatrox, You\u2019re a very mobile champion, thanks to you E. It can be used in multiple ways and is a good way of turning around exchanges with the enemy.\n\nYou have tons of sustain thanks to your Passive and Ultimate R. This will increase your survivability in team fights and skirmishes.\n\nAatrox has good skirmishing potential and can 1v1 most champions, especially if he can fight them when they have an ability on cooldown."}
{"text": "As nunu, Really good Objective control due to his Q and Smite. It also allows him to heal up both in the lane and in the Jungle, which provides him an innate advantage against other Junglers.\n\nGreat ganking potential due to his W, especially if there is no vision set-up by the enemy team. This can lead to a great CC chain.\n\nHis Ultimate R can allow him to set-up phenomenal death brushes while contesting objectives. This can allow him to end the game or take the objective quite freely."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Once Aatrox hits level 9, his Q will be maxed. The reduced cooldown and additional haste will mean this ability is on a very short cooldown.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Aatrox will have brought items that will reduce his abilities cooldown. Through levels 9-13, his abilities will be on a very short cooldown.\n\nWhen Aatrox hits level 11 and puts two points in his Ultimate R, he will be a severe threat to the enemy in team fights. Fight around your Ultimate to deal a ton of damage and survive the team fight."}
{"text": "As belveth, Bel\u2019Veth has a lot of depth to her basic abilities with high mobility, Pre-6 CC in her W knockup and her E granting her damage reduction, % missing health damage AND lifesteal. This means she\u2019s a very complete champion already at level 3.\n\nShe scales incredibly well with Attack speed as it benefits her whole kit and her whole playstyle revolves around this. If she manages to get those core items and hit that mid game ahead, she will absolutely terrorise the rift. \n\nBel\u2019Veth has a lot of single target damage with her auto attacks and her passive but she also deals significant AoE true damage due to those Void Corals that she can consume from enemy champions and objectives\n"}
{"text": "As tristana, Try to target your abilities by pushing so they hit it and the minion wave at the same time. Your level 6 is very strong. Try to make it fall first before committing your Ultimate on it. Play safely early on. It is stronger than you and you need some time to come online, so make sure to limit the damage it can do via automatic attacks."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah\u2019s kill pressure doesn\u2019t increase at level 6 but her ability to roam does. If you\u2019re strong at level 6, try to abuse her.\n\nAfter she has her first item completed, Taliyah can quickly push the wave with her Q. Ensure you\u2019re always behind the minion wave or outside of it so she cannot push and poke at the same time. \n\nThe more items she gets the stronger Taliyah will be. Avoid letting her poke you down with Q as she will deal lots of damage to you. In particular, do not let her delay a team fight with her Q."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, If they invade you early, right back. This is especially true if they are early, because you won't win early fights with them Be proactive with your Ultimate, because they will seek to use theirs every time it's up. Force ganks with your R! As they will often gaunt in early play, you need to make sure that you also look at gank as often as you can and abuse your E. Focus on securing these goals. You need to take Rift Heralds and Drakes when you can!"}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz is strong at level 3 and 4 once he unlocks all 3 of his abilities. He should play somewhat safer until he reaches either 3 or 4 and then look for an aggressive all-in.\n\nFizz\u2019s main power spike is once he hits level 6. His Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool that can help him get kills with ease. It has a short cooldown so he will be able to play aggressively over and over again.\n\nOnce Fizz has recalled and picked up his first item, he\u2019ll be able to dish out of a lot of damage quite quickly. A good Fizz will not be scared to go for aggressive plays especially if he has a better first item than his lane opponent."}
{"text": "Against naafiri, She is very good at roaming and ganking, so make sure you communicate with your team so they know when she is missing. Place vision in her jungle entrances and the river.\n\nIn the mid-game, she will look to take down targets that are walking around the map alone. Avoid moving through the river if it\u2019s not warded.\n\nPlaying around her Packmates in the mid-game and during team fights will be extremely beneficial as she will lack damage.\n"}
{"text": "As kogmaw, At level 6, Kog'Maw will have access to its Ultimate y. This is important because the poke damage is really beneficial to reduce health enemies. This damage is further amplified if Kog'Maw goes for AP construction or hybrid construction. Its first element will give it a boost of damage and will take more trades in the way. However, it will have to be careful over-extending and be taken out. Adding several points in its e will allow it to flatten a lot of damage in a short time. This helps a lot when it comes to slowing down and damaging enemies, especially those who are still."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille may look for an all-in at level 3 or 4 once she has access to her core abilities. Try and not lose too much health prior to hitting level 3 otherwise it is guaranteed that she will look for the all-in.\n \nWhenever Camille has her E available, you need to be careful with your positioning as it will provide her with an opportunity to engage if you\u2019re stood by a wall. Stand in the middle of the lane as much as possible.\n \nAt level 6 Camille will gain access to her Ultimate R which can be deadly if you\u2019re low and overextended. Respect her all-in and do not push without vision as her Ultimate R can also be used to set up her Jungler."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Split push and draw aggro while your team applies pressure elsewhere on the map.\n\nIn team fights, use your empowered E to get picks to start the fight. Catching someone out and subsequently getting a kill could provide your team with enough time to take the Baron or Dragon.\n\nPeel for your team in team fights. Use your Q on the nearest champion to protect yourself and your ADC."}
{"text": "As akshan, During the average game, make sure you are not ADC'ing regularly. Clean up kills when possible, but don't get too close to the other heavy CC champions, you will definitely get killed. Use your E carefully in this phase of the game. The goal is to make sure that you are never taken out of sight by a skill shot that has the potential of CC you. Your W will come in very practical during this phase of the game. Stay in the backline and keep hitting the enemies until your team all-in. Once the battle is over, go for cleaning kills."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble\u2019s first major power spike is when he hits level 6. Unlocking his Ultimate b is a major power spike for Rumble.\n\nWhen he purchases his first component item, his skirmishing power increases dramatically. Look for aggressive plays after you\u2019ve got your first component item.\n\nRumble is a strong skirmishing champion early. Look for ganks frequently to get yourself and your team ahead.\n"}
{"text": "As anivia, Continue pushing the minion wave with your Ultimate m while remaining safe. Keep the waves pushed so the enemy is unable to do anything or siege any of your objectives.\n\nRotate and move to objectives like the Dragon or Rift Herald and assist your Jungler in taking them. Anivia can help take these objectives incredibly fast.\n\nMake sure you have vision around your lane at all times. As you\u2019ll be constantly pushing, you need to ensure your flanks are warded so you do not die while you\u2019re overextended and pushing."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio should be getting his build completed by now. This will give him a massive spike in his ability to peel for the allied carries. His damage output will be pretty high as well.\n\nGalio's Ultimate R will still be handy during fights due to its knockup and low cooldown. He can easily split push and show up to fights with his Ultimate R in a jiffy.\n\nLevel 16 isn't that big a spike for Galio. Although his Ultimate R cooldown is reduced and the cast range is increased, he won't have any incentive to use it for himself."}
{"text": "As gnar, Delay team fights until your Rage Bar is fully stacked. Do not team fight until you\u2019re ready to change. Once you\u2019ve changed forms, make sure you engage and fight.\n\nGroup as often as you can. Gnar is a really good team fighter in the mid-game as long as he can get his Ultimate R off.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, split push. Your champion is good at split pushing, so you may as well go to a side lane and start to push while your team attempts to siege elsewhere."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Destroying his E barrels before he can detonate it can take a lot of damage off his kit. It forms a major part of his early game damage and without it, he will just be stuck farming and occasionally helping his team with his Ultimate R.\n\nHis W is an important spell in his kit and he is very weak once that ability is down during the early game. He becomes really prone to ganks when this ability is down and he can\u2019t really escape without using summoner spells.\n\nFighting in open spaces reduces the effectiveness of Gangplank as he won\u2019t be able to use his E barrels to the fullest potential. The same thing applies to his Ultimate R. He can\u2019t initiate an all-in without his Ultimate R during the early game as well."}
{"text": "As kassadin, After six, he can start avoiding the ganks and can wander around and try to get the murders. Once he gets the snowball roll, it is very difficult to stop him, especially if he reaches level eleven. Excellent potential of burst damage on an ill-placed enemy. This becomes extremely strong from level eleven, and can practically a target shot."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Once you have destroyed the tower of the track, move in another way and try to take this goal too. Try to harass and poke the enemy as often as you can with your Q. Using your abilities will often allow you to stack your Tear quickly too. Getting it stacked in the middle of the game is crucial. Continue farming and move around the map. It is important that you collect as much gold as possible."}
{"text": "Against fizz, By walking around the Rift Invocation, do not go alone if you are squishy. Fizz can easily assassinate someone who walks through the river alone. Take appropriate paths through the monitored areas whenever possible. Do not use execution capabilities or keystrokes on Fizz unless he has used his E as he can easily avoid them by going non-target. If you are hit by the Fizzs Ultimate R, do not walk near your allies because the damage of his shark's AOE inflicts a lot of damage on them too. Walk towards them but do not approach."}
{"text": "As kindred, Several batteries will allow Kindred to simply take control of the game. Its damage output will be massive, and it will melt through the tanks and squishes at once. Its first capacity will be maximized at level 9. It will increase the overall damage and allow it to be completely mobile during the fighting. Another point in its ultimate R will increase the frequency with which Kindred can use the capability. This helps in neutral and objective combats as it can lure the enemy Jungler to waste their Smit."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he goes in with his E, he can\u2019t get out due to his E being on a very high cooldown initially. \n\nIf his Passive is down, he can\u2019t play as aggressively due to the threat of him being killed. This is applicable for early to mid-game fights only.\n\nTeams with lots of CC and disengage tools are really good against Zac. He struggles to get onto targets, use his Ultimate R and make use of his Q when the enemy has escapes/ or CC."}
{"text": "As galio, Rely on picking off enemies with your E and W in the enemy Jungle. Don't just blatantly all-in without follow-up, though, else you will just end up dying.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a very short cooldown now. This simply means that you can save your teammates quite often. You may even use the allied champs who rely on diving the enemy team to secure a massive knockup at the heart of the enemy team.\n\nMaking fights unfair for the enemy team should be your primary goal. It is not necessary to kill an enemy off but chunking them out is a viable strat too. So, if you set up a death brush and manage to catch someone, don't over-commit and die instead."}
{"text": "Against elise, It is not impossible for Elise to ganker at level 2 or 3. In fact, it is very good at it. Be ready to gank the upper track to level 3 and counter it. Remember that she doesn't have much follow after her initial use of cooldowns. Elise doesn't have a peak at level 6 as most champions because she already has access to all her abilities. Keep this in mind when you fight and gang. If you're 6 peak power is great, make sure you exploit it and gank as often as you can. Elise can be difficult to fight alone unless you can get the jump on it."}
{"text": "As shaco, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall behind in the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure to continue growing! As you are a Jungler, you must try to secure each Drake during the middle of the game. Get them and secure the Dragon soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.

{"text": "As belveth, At this stage in the Bel-Veth game will have its full path of building the base element and it will make a huge amount of damage while being incredibly slippery. This makes its fondness to be a constant enormous damage production and being extremely threatening for enemy backline teams. Not only will be shredded door but due to the nature of its itemization it should have an easy time tearing through these frontliners too. If she consumes a Coral Void at this point in the game and activates its True Form, it will be very difficult to remove due to all these bonus statistics she wins."}
{"text": "As swain, His early play is excellent as he can completely CC and blow up an enemy target when necessary. Using the brush line will allow him to reap a lot of benefits. Level six is an excellent peak as he can now control the pace of a team struggle. He can easily be between the enemy team while treating a lot of health and regenerate a lot of health in return. The first element will allow him to spam his abilities frequently and deposit a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, If he can pull a single shot at the person he is aiming for, he will be controlled almost immediately by the crowd and killed on the spot. Unbelievably vulnerable once his Ultimate R is about to cool down. The enemy team should seek to fight him during this time and target him in front of anyone else. Not very effective against a group of champions because he is extremely dependent on the peaks to get a lead. Moreover, the crowd controlling him can allow the enemy team to get rid of him quite easily."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen's first major power peak is at level 6 when it unlocks its Ultimate R. It offers its tons of additional trading potential and will allow it to fight the enemy Jungler with ease. When Gwen purchased its first component, its escaring power and clear speed increase sharply. Gwen can start to crash after level 3, but it is more common for her to start crashing after level 4."}
{"text": "As lucian, His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will give him a huge boost and allow him to regain the middle of the game easily. Lucian is excellent during the middle of the game as this is the time when he is most powerful. He can get rid of the squishy targets quickly. At level 11, Lucian will be able to get his stage 2 Ultimate R. He can help him massively during neutral, objective and duel battles because of the amount of damage he makes available to the dishes."}
{"text": "As shyvana, When you try all the enemies with your Ultimate t, note your portages. Your job will be to fall back and peel for them if they are not sure enough. Depending on the construction you go for, you will have different jobs in the team. If you go for AP, focus on the backline, otherwise, focus on maintaining the enemy front line out of your team. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Focus on farming in the early game. You need to earn as much gold as possible to be a major threat later on.\n\nYou\u2019re going to naturally push the minion wave with your Turrets Q.

Heimer is vulnerable to ganks if he doesn\u2019t have 3 Turrets Q up, so keep this in mind.\n\nIf the enemy laner roams, don\u2019t bother trying to contest their roam. Instead, push the minion wave and start earning turret plate gold."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is one of the first strongest game champions in the game. Make sure you are constantly fighting to win an advance. After Darius has finished his first component element, his output of passive and global damage can be extremely heinous. If you were able to win a murder before picking it up, you will have a serious advantage over the enemy that you should seek to increase. When Darius touches level 6, he can use his Ultimate e to execute a target."}
{"text": "As soraka, It can easily get rid of if it gets the crowd controlled. The incorrect use of its E can give windows to the enemy team to all-en-Soraka or its partner laner. Trying not to use it for the poke is the best bet of Soraka. Its healing can easily be reduced with the purchase of a Grievous Wounds item. It is also thwarted by enemies who have some form of dash that they can use to avoid its Q."}
{"text": "As zed, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nThey can secure objective so much easier than you can. Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nPost 6, avoid fighting them at all costs as they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will easily kill you.\n\nA good player will be playing around their Ultimate as often as it comes up. You need to counter their ganking pressure by doing the same."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac is a great ganker early because of his ability to execute long-range ganks out of sight. The enemy team will not have enough resources to keep everything, and therefore Zac can quickly capitalize on this. Level 6 is an important peak of power as he gets access to a fighting team Ultimate R. He can use the fog of the war to catch the enemy by surprise and can separate the critical targets from their teammates, which will ultimately allow Zac team to kill this target. The first element is beneficial because it gives him added durability. This can easily allow him to take part in prolonged battles, peel for his litters, and backline enemy area during major battles."}

Anyone who is caught out by Karthus will take a massive chunk of damage and will probably even die if they are singled out by Karthus.\n\nKarthus can control a large part of the lane during the mid-game and pick off enemies with his ranged abilities. He can even slow enemies with his wall, which allows his team to collapse and initiate fights.        "}
{"text": "As irelia, It's deadly for her if the enemy team overshadows CC, or if it sinks too deeply into the enemy team and has no form of follow-up of its team. Its Q use needs a lot of practice and awareness. If it doesn't have the time, this ability will cool down and it is not able to do much if it is not close to its target. It will also make it subject to CC. Landing its ultimate R on range can be an exhausting task, especially if the enemy has a dash shape. Once its ultimate R is in decline, its potential all below a bit that the enemy can kite it."}

{"text": "As neeko, It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Don't just stay in the middle if you can't get anything done. Flank in the team fights to make it easier to access the enemy backline. Use your W to speed up to get off a good R Ultimate. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their timer of death to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more murders."}

Try to deny as many stacks as possible by invading him so he is unable to scale quickly.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Nasus gets. Make sure you end the game as quickly as possible.\n\nNasus wouldn\u2019t be seen on the map early, but post 6, he will start ganking a lot. Especially when he has multiple points in his W."}
{"text": "Against drmundo, At level 6, Dr Mundo will look to trade more frequently as his Ultimate R provides him with a lot of duelling power and sustain. Keep this in mind whenever he hits level 6. \n\nDr Mundo can poke you down at level 1 with his Q. Try to dodge as many as possible so you do not have to blow through an early health pot, or become a target for a level 3 gank.\n\nWhen Dr Mundo has completed Bami\u2019s Cinder, his trading power is much stronger. Do not disrespect his all-in potential once he has this item."}
{"text": "Against lucian, Level 2 is the first wave followed by a melee minion on the second wave. * At level 6, Lucian has much more trading power thanks to his Ultimate R. Once he activates it, try to reposition it, disengage it or lock it with CC, so that he is unable to land every ball on you. * Every time Lucian E is up, he will be stronger than he can dodge skill shots and CC. If he uses this ability aggressively, use the cooldown of this one to play aggressive and trade with him."}
{"text": "Against neeko, At level 6, Neeko will be strong enough. Its Ultimate R can be used as a tool of engagement or disengagement / utility. Be on the lookout for its Ultimate R! Neeko will sting once it is back and gets its first component element. But, this force depends on whether it is going AP or AD Neeko. Neeko can be really good in team fighting if enemy groups together. Avoid grouping too closely to reduce its effectiveness in fighting."}
{"text": "As orianna, Do not fight as a team in the later parts of the game unless your Zhonyas Hurglass and Ultimate d are both in place. Delay / disengage fights if the enemy wants to fight you. Stay with your team in the late parts of the game. If you are caught or the enemy launches a fight while you are not there, the enemy will win the team fight. Poke and delay the team fights while you and your team harass the enemy and make them low. Once they are low, engage yourself. You can also look for choices with your abilities to catch someone who is out of position."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus' ultimate e is an excellent tool, and it can allow him to impact the map from afar. His afterlife alone can change the tide of a fight, especially if the enemy continues to fight near him after his death. Karthus' early play is relatively weak. This can make it difficult for him to survive the laning phase, especially when faced with a strong early champion."}
{"text": "As viktor, His d is the only form of self-peel for him. Once this ability is lowered, he is quite vulnerable to ganks. In team fights, he can be flanked with ease too. He will try to play safely during the early match and will not have much damage if he can't upgrade his passive core. Playing aggressively and forcing him out of the early track can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage over him. Very subject to all in, especially in the bot track when against a hard crowd control Support. He has some form of buff motion speed with his r but in layers crowd control can easily counter that."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Throughout the laning phase, try and keep the wave closer to your side of the map. If you push, he could zone you away from the farm and kill you when you walk up to CS.\n\nMaster Yi is weak early, but will be stronger once he hits level 6. Take care and avoid staying in lane if you\u2019re low so you don\u2019t get killed by him.\n\nAvoid giving him kills early. Master Yi is a snowball heavy champion and can easily take over the map if you let him get ahead."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie will have her complete build by now. Her ability to impact team fights will be at its peak, and she can easily flank and get kills on the enemy backline.\n\nShe won't have to worry a lot about being caught out of place without her Ultimate R to save herself during this game phase. That ability will pretty much be up almost all the time.\n\nAnnie can take over the game single-handedly if she manages to control the vision placement around the map. Any form of death brush will be lethal to enemies due to Annie's overall damage."}
{"text": "As leesin, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. Post 6, avoid fighting them at any cost because they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will kill you easily. A good player will play around their Ultimate as often as he comes. You have to counter their waste pressure by doing the same thing."}
{"text": "As syndra, Syndra is really powerful during the middle of the game because it can dry a lot of damage to the squishy enemies. It can easily set up death brushes as well. Several points in its Ultimate R will allow it to explode enemies with ease. Enemy squishies will have a difficult time to deal with Syndra. Its first ability will be maximized at level 9, and it will dry a lot of damage regularly. It can also inflict a lot of damage if it is sitting somewhere out of sight."}
{"text": "As fizz, Stay near your team in the late game. You shouldn\u2019t be too far away from them otherwise the enemy may force a fight or catch your team out of position. \n\nLook for picks with your Ultimate R in late-game fights. If you can pick someone off who steps too far forward, you can use the numbers advantage to start another team fight.\n\nGroup with your team in the late game, but try to stay hidden. This will allow you to get picks or initiate once the enemy walks too far forward or gets close to your team."}
{"text": "Against lucian, * In team fights, take care that Lucian can use his E to reposition and escape danger. Try and wait for him to use his E before using your CC capabilities so it's harder for him to avoid them. * Avoid letting Lucian get a full channel of his Ultimate R on you in a team fight by disengageing or cancelling it with CC. * Lookout for Lucian positioning. He will often walk forward to land auto attacks. Once he's mispositioned, use this to your advantage to concentrate him down."}
{"text": "As swain, His tankness and damage are really high during this phase of the game. He can also use his Zhonya Hurglass to be impassable for one while inflicting damage all the time. A maximum-out Ultimate R will allow him to survive the fights with ease. The damage will be pretty devastating for the enemy team as well. Swain's late match is strong due to his prowess fighting team. He can immediately kill the enemy team if he manages to catch them near a choke point."}
{"text": "Against irelia, Avoid trading with Irelia when she has her Passive stacked as she will out trade you. Keep an eye on the little bar under her health.\n\nWhen trading with Irelia, keep an eye on low health minions in your lane. Irelia may use her Q on the minion to escape the trade or run you down after a skirmish.\n\nIrelia benefits from extended trades. Try and avoid going for extended trades with her as she will always win them."}
{"text": "As ryze, Can=t really does a lot during the early game, especially if he's against something with the hard CC or if he's camped. Extremely the linked and won article takes a lot of damage if he was put behind at the beginning and middle of the game. His ultimate R changes the positioning of him and anyone within the circle. This can make Ryze fight and get his whole team killed if the right vision is not put in place before the ability is used."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Invade Fiddle in the early game to deny him as much gold as you can. He is weak before level 6 but even weaker before level 3 so use that to your advantage.\n \nWhen Fiddlesticks reaches level 6 he will try to surprise gank you with his R. Keep track of where Fiddlesticks is and inform your team, so they can get wards down and play safe when he is on their side of the map.\n \nBefore engaging on to Fiddlesticks, ask yourself if this is the real one. Don\u2019t waste everything on a fake scarecrow."}
{"text": "As lux, Stand outside of the minion wave so she cannot push and poke you with her E. But, stand behind the minion wave instead so she cannot land her Q on you while you\u2019re isolated.\n\nHer level 6 is much stronger than yours. Make sure you play safe and back if you\u2019re on low HP.\n\nFocus on farming in the early game. Try to poke when you can, but your main goal early should be to gain a significant CS lead.\n\nShe is stronger than you early. Keep this in mind and limit trading."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Disengage is your best friend when dealing with Neeko and her Ultimate R in team fights. Disengage as soon as Neeko walks forward and tries to engage to minimize the usefulness of her Ultimate R.\n\nWard your flanks and nearby bushes when sieging objectives as Neeko may use her Passive and W to get a good engage off with her Ultimate R.\n\nSplitting up and not standing too close together will help reduce how many people Neeko and stun with her Ultimate R. Group when team fighting, but don\u2019t stand too close together."}
{"text": "As sion, Sion can make cheese to the enemy at level 1. Thus, his level 1 is very strong in the role of Support. At level 6, Sion can set up his ADC or Jungler on track to get killed. If he can't set up anyone, he can look to wander and help his Mid or Top laner instead. As soon as Sion upgrades his boots, he can wander with ease. This combined with his Ultimate R makes Zion a good roaming champion early."}
{"text": "As swain, Swain's level 3 is a massive power spike as he can now go for all-ins with a high amount of burst damage. Concealing his position in the lane brushes should give him the element of surprise as well.\n\nLevel 6 is another significant power spike. He can now all-in an entire enemy team and deal a lot of AoE damage. This is very useful during neutral objective fights and clumped team fights.\n\nThe first item will give him a massive burst damage boost. This is vital and will lead to Swain taking over the game quickly. He can use the lane brushes to solo kill enemy targets with ease."}
{"text": "As riven, Extremely weak when she is CC-D as she can't use her dashes and can be killed easily. This allows the enemy team to take her before a major fight or when her e is on cooldown. Too steep of a learning curve, which makes it very difficult for new players to master this champion. Efficiency is reduced if the player can't cancel the automatic attack animations. Very difficult for her to return to the game if she falls behind early. Very useful for the enemy team to spoil her when she is pushed up or dive her when her r is on cooldown."}
{"text": "Against anivia, Anivia is a very mana-hungry champion and will need blue buff as often as possible. While she is low on mana, use this as an opportunity to deny her farm.\n\nWhen you\u2019re roaming around the map, make sure you keep an eye on the minion wave in mid. Anivia can push the wave very fast and you\u2019ll lose a lot of Tower health if you\u2019re gone for too long. Try and roam while she is in base so she can\u2019t take your Tower.\n\nCC is your best friend against Anivia as she is squishy and immobile. But she does have tools to defend herself like her t and e. To make locking her down easier, try to flank her rather than running directly at her to make it harder for her to escape."}
{"text": "Against lux, Lux is really strong once she unlocks her Ultimate n. At this point, she will be able to get killed and crush you. Once Lux has a maximum cooldown reduction, her abilities will be on really weak cooldowns. This means she will be able to poke and trade quite frequently. Don't let her cooldowns take you by her cooldowns. In the later stages of the game, Lux is really strong and can very easily remove any target if she lands her g. Try and place her behind in the early game so she can't get tons of AP and snowball."}
{"text": "As lux, You will want to keep hitting the enemy with your l in this way. Do not let them grow easily, and you should always go and poke your enemy sleds when they go to the farm. Track brushes must be controlled, and always use them to land your g on the enemy. This helps a lot to catch the out-of-guard enemies and execute your 100 to 0 post-six combo. Once you unlock your Ultimate n, you will want to look for more opportunities to land your g on the enemy. Do not get too close to the enemy while doing this, as you are still and can be killed easily."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn is an early-playing brute that is varied. This allows her to harass and sneak into melee Top lesners to get an advance. While she doesn't have a Ultimate R fight, her Ultimate R is an excellent roaming tool that can allow her to return to the track quickly and also wander around the map and help her allies."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble is very immobile and prone to all-ins. Try to freeze the wave closer to your side of the map. This will force him to overextend for farm, which can allow you to all-in him, deny him from farm or even set up your Jungler for an easy takedown.\n\nRumble is rather squishy early and suffers heavily when his r is on cooldown as he will lack damage. Looking to fight after he uses his r will make trading easier for you.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate Rumble\u2019s damage in a trade. If you get hit by multiple e\u2019s and stand in his r for too long, he will dish out a lot of damage. "}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble deals more damage when his bar is over 50%. Be cautious about taking trades when it is above this amount. Although, if you can bait out his bar and make him overheat- he will lack ability damage.\n\nOnce Rumble has his Ultimate b, his kill pressure increases. Do not underestimate his all-in potential with his Ultimate b. If he uses it on you, try to retreat as his Jungler might be trying to gank as his Ultimate b is a good gank setup. \n\nRumble is strong in team fights so expect him to be grouping and looking for picks with his Ultimate b during the mid and late game."}
{"text": "As viktor, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass."}
{"text": "As rengar, Focus on farming and hitting level 6 as quickly as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your ganking potential.\n\nYour Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Whenever it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get kills.\n\nTry to secure objectives with your team. If you can, try to keep it warded at all times if you\u2019re not in a position to take it yourself."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Look for peaks on the enemy when they are out of position. If you can catch the enemy Support, you can turn to Baron or Dragon or force a fight with the advantage of numbers. In the late part, you have to call for Baron or the elder Dragon. Do not otherwise die your team will not be able to secure them and the enemy will take it for free. Once you have entered, make sure to fall and peel for your allies. Use your ultimate m to lock the key targets and then use your d & e to hit the enemy on your ports."}
{"text": "As ksante, It is really important that you land those **Q**s early on. The cooldown is long early, and if you miss once, you wont be able to get the third stack and CC the enemy as the timer will run out.\n\nMake sure you keep the minion wave a little closer early on. Post 6, you will not be able to engage if you\u2019re pushing as you will not be tanky enough to dive the enemy.\n\nAs you have lots of CC tools in your kit, you can look to make plays with your Jungler. Freeze the wave near your tower so you can get ganks and all-in the enemy.\n"}
{"text": "As qiyana, Your goal in the laning phase is to abuse the enemy and get murders. Try to play aggressive when appropriate to get an early advance. Use your strong 1v1 potential to travel the map and help your allies kill safely. If you can get murders and help your allies, your chances of winning the game will be much higher. Once your allies have turned towards the average path, turn to another way and split thrust. It is important that you do not fall behind in CS and XP by staying in the middle when there are many other champions there."}
{"text": "As chogath, Cho-Gath can easily get kited by ADCs and champions with dashes in team fights. This makes it difficult for him to catch the mobile champions. If Cho-Gath decides to use his Ultimate t on a minion, he has to wait a long time for him to come back. When he is on the cooldown as well, he lacks on many real potential damage. Cho-Gath is pretty weak in the way depending on the match he is in. He is really weak against the champions with strong early matches."}
{"text": "As riven, Riven will start falling off as the game goes on, so she will have to accumulate a lead early on. She should rely on picks to win the game.\n\nShe will have many items during this phase of the game, which will let her dish out a lot of damage if she manages to catch an enemy.\n\nLevel 16 is a massive power spike, which means that she can completely decimate enemies who are clumped together. She will need to find flanks on the enemy frequently."}
{"text": "Against swain, At level 6, the exit and survival of the damage increases. You should not engage in a fight with him unless you can bring him down quickly that his Ultimate R will offer him additional protection and health regeneration. Swain, early play is abuseable because it is really weak early. Once the mid-game hits, you will have to play more respectable. It is really good in the team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Bursting him at the beginning of the fight will make it difficult for him to inflict damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "Against vayne, Vayne\u2019s first power spike is when she is level 6. Her kill pressure and manoeuvrability increases dramatically whenever her Ultimate n  is up.\n\nVayne is incredibly weak in the early game. Try to abuse this if you can.\n\nEnd the game as fast as possible. Vayne is a late-game monster and will be incredibly hard to kill in the late game."}
{"text": "As corki, At level 13, Corki will max his second ability which is usually his n. This is a very powerful spike for Corki as it will allow him to shred through tanks in late game team fights.\n\nAt level 16, Corki will put the third and final point in his Ultimate e. As teams will be grouping at this stage of the game, he will be able to poke them down a lot before initiating a fight.\n\nCorki is very good in the late game as long as he is not behind. Try and avoid falling behind in the early game to make you an overwhelming force to be reckoned with in the late game."}
{"text": "Against kled, Kled will always be stronger when he is mounted. He is slightly weaker when he is dismounted.\n\nAt level 6, Kled has increased mobility and the potential to impact multiple lanes with his Ultimate R. He can also use his Ultimate R to engage and chase down the enemy. Do not overextend in lane as he can easily kill you.\n\nKled is one of the strongest champions in the game. He will try to fight you as much as he can to get an early lead."}
{"text": "As skarner, His ability to kidnap a carry and then put them in a disadvantageous position allows him to flank enemies with ease. His tankiness prevents him from getting killed immediately.\n\nHis strength increases if he actively tries to clear wards and use the lack of vision to gank enemies. This is due to the amount of pick potential which he has in his kit.\n\nCan take objectives quite easily. This includes the early void grubs and the Dragons. Keep them warded or secure them before he can!\n"}
{"text": "As senna, She is very motionless and can be killed easily if she is all-in-one. This can stop her during the early game and force her to play defensively. Her enemies can look at everything as soon as she misses her W, so she has to use this ability quite carefully. She will be more focused on getting her passive batteries in order to be able to carry later in the game. Invisibility E can be easily counterbalanced with a properly placed Control Ward. Her Q costs a lot of mana so and can make her run out of resources if she uses this ability in a carefree way."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, When no team fights are occurring, move to a side lane and focus on farming and earning XP and gold.\n\nIn team fights, try to flank the enemy. This will increase your chances of getting a good Ultimate R off.\n\nLook for fights inside tight spots of the map or get picks with your Ultimate R. CC\u2019ing a key target will make fighting so much easier."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid pushing the wave as much as you can as Yasuo has an incredibly strong all-in and can take you down if you\u2019re pushing. Try to keep the wave closer to your side of the map in the laning phase so he is unable to chase you down and kill you. \n\nBe cautious around the minion wave as Yasuo will often use his E to dash through the minion wave to get on to you. Stand outside and away from the minion wave at all times.\n\nTry to space accordingly to Yasuo and his Support. If the Support has CC, try to play as far back as possible. This will make it hard for them to get on to you. Post 6, make sure you\u2019re always in a safe position so they cannot all-in you. "}
{"text": "As kalista, Kalista will have the range advantage over many laners. This will allow her to abuse and harass them whenever they walk up to the farm.\n\nIf she freezes near her tower, she can gain a significant CS and gold lead over the enemy. In addition to this, she can use her strong duelling power to chase down the enemy laner when they walk up or overextend.\n\nShe can use her Ultimate x on her Jungler, which will allow them to gank her lane with ease or help her save them in a team fight.\n"}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall behind in the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure to continue growing! As you are a Jungler, you must try to secure each Drake during the middle of the game. Get them and secure the Dragon soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game. Look for choices with your team. If you can choose someone, make the call for Baron or Dragon to continue your lead."}
{"text": "Against evelynn, Evelynn gets stronger with the murders. Try to reduce her gold income by not stopping on your welcome and getting killed by her. By not dying for her, you will reduce her efficiency as the game continues. Evelynn needs level 6 as quickly as possible so she can unlock her Ultimate R and become invisible. Respect her post-level 6 ganks and make sure to follow her with a good vision throughout her jungle."}
{"text": "As azir, Your ability to control a zone/area is quite strong and almost unparalleled.\n\nYou can dish out a lot of consistent damage if you are given the chance.

{"text": "As rakan, Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability more frequently. It will be helpful in mid-game fights.\n\nHis pick potential is incredible during this portion of the game.

All he needs to do is not get caught out, as it will definitely get him killed.        "}
{"text": "As azir, When you hit level 6, more opportunities open up to you. For instance, you can look for aggressive plays or use your Ultimate R defensively. Your Ultimate R is a genuinely diverse tool that can help you gain a lead or prevent you from losing one.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve picked up your first component item, your r poke and damage will increase dramatically. Don\u2019t be afraid to look for fights once you\u2019ve picked up your first item.\n\nWhile Azir\u2019s poke is good, he is incredibly weak in the early game. Don\u2019t trade too much before your first back, so you don\u2019t fall behind. You need time to come online, so focus on farming and surviving the very early game."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late-game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting without it will make the late-game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown."}
{"text": "As chogath, When your team is not regrouping or trying to fight, divide the thrust and close a storm in the side lane. Look for peaks when you are grouped with your team with your m and e.

In addition, avoid team fights unless your Ultimate t is up as it inflicts tons of damage."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Multiple items during this phase of the game will allow him to fight enemies effectively.

In the late game, depending on his items, he may be able to dish out tons of damage to a squishy target.\n\nAt level 13, Akshan will max out his E. The additional mobility is very powerful in the later stages of the game.\n\nOnce again, as teams will be grouping in the late game, if he can get the shut down on a marked enemy, he can bring an ally back to life which could turn the tide of the game.\n"}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Putting the second point in Fiddlesticks Ultimate R at level 11 is very important to him. It will put his Ultimate R on a shorter cooldown and allow him to look for more aggressive pieces. At this stage of the game, Fiddlesticks should have finished one or two articles. Its damage release will be quite high that will allow him to win team fights mid-game. In the middle of the game, the teams start to regroup. It's good for Fiddlesticks because he benefits from teams regrouping closely because his Ultimate R is an AOE tool."}

{"text": "Against ezreal, Make sure you're still standing behind a minion at any time to make it harder for him to land his Q and push you down. The best time to go for trades and kicks on Ezreal is when his E is on the cooldown. If he's using it aggressively, try to abuse cooldown and look for an aggressive game while he's defenseless. If Ezreal uses his Ultimate R to sniper someone on the map, ping your team while he's moving through Summoners Rift. This will help them avoid incoming ability. Although this ability is on the cooldown, you could look to play aggressive and try to fight it."}

{"text": "Against irelia, Try to lock Irelia at the beginning of the fight. This will make it much harder for her to jump around your team and reset to her Q. Avoid fighting too closely together as it will allow Irelia to use her Ultimate R on several people and allow her to reset Q. Stand together but not very closely together. Try and fight after Irelia uses her E as it is one of her best tools to start a fight. Ideally, try and fight also around her Ultimate R as it will reduce her chances of reset."}

Don't forget to use your ultimate R in neutral objective fighting. You don't have to go indirectly, but your presence will certainly effectively keep enemies away. Your self-appointed W passive will help you a lot by trying out all enemies and escaping unharmed. Just make sure you have enough batteries ready to use when time comes."}
{"text": "As skarner, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. Moreover, your best bet is to invest in an early pen item.

As a Jungler, Gragas will mostly be the latter, so his main goal will be to blow up the enemy backline when he gets the chance.\n\nHis dash and Ultimate R make up for a significant amount of peel for his carries. Should he go for the tank build route, he will successfully absorb much damage for his team while his team follows up on Gragas' engagement."}

Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to create opportunities for your gank jungler.

Be careful when facing Swain at level 6, as its death pressure increases considerably with the power of its ultimate.

Avoid detaching yourself from your ADC when Swain's E capacity (Nevermove) is rising, as it can interrupt your W (you and me!)."}
{"text": "As taliyah, This is particularly true at the beginning of the game. Her Ultimate R has the probability of having her entire team killed if it is inappropriately used.

The ground engineer on her Q can easily allow her drags to play in the middle of the track as she can continue to block her enemies with continuous Qs."}
{"text": "As gragas, His E can be blocked by minions, so the enemy can easily hide behind a minion and prevent Gragas from doing anything to threaten them. If the enemy has a dash, it will become really difficult for Gragas to do anything in the way. If the enemy team puts a good vision around the map during the early match, it will find it difficult to crash/rag on other tracks.

Try to force fights when his Ultimate t is down."}
{"text": "As riven, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate e is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate e is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As janna, Janna excels during team fights and fights around clumped areas. Her e can act as a source of engagement and a disengage depending on the situation and the enemy team comp, but her ability to let her team fight for a long time is what makes her so good.\n\nGetting multiple items will boost her usefulness massively. She won't ever run out of mana, and her shield strength will increase by a lot. That, along with the damage it provides to her carries will allow her to carry a game from behind.\n\nThree-points in her d at level 16 will allow her to heal up her entire team within seconds during a significant fight. This means that taking neutral objectives like the Baron and Dragon after an exhaustive fight will always be possible."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Try CC the enemy. It's relatively easy and you can cut them once it's done. Your Ultimate can be a real game changer. Your goal is to prevent Karthus from getting in your team. Keep the wave in the middle of the track and scale up. Once you're stacked, you should have an easy fighting time,"}
{"text": "As neeko, As this is a poke matchup, you mustn\u2019t let Neeko push you into your tower otherwise you will struggle to survive. Try to match Neeko's pushing power by auto-attacking minions and dodging their poke.\n\nYou\u2019re weaker than them whenever they have their Ultimate up. If you\u2019re at risk of dying, always recall at level 5 so you do not get killed when they hit level 6.\n\nMake sure you hit level 2 at the same time as Neeko, as they\u2019re way stronger than you at level 2 and by hitting level 2 before or at the same time, you\u2019ll have a better chance at fighting back.\n\nTry to adapt your positioning as much as possible. Don\u2019t stand too far forward because she will easily be able to hit you with her Q or E. Always stand in a position where you can play aggressively and apply a mental threat to Neeko"}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Try not to group too closely as it will allow Vladimir to get a good Ultimate e off. By splitting up slightly, Vladimir will have to use his Ultimate e on fewer targets. \n\nExpect Vladimir to flank from the side in team fights. Ward your flanks so you spot him before he is able to get on top of your team.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, you need healing reduction on your carries to reduce his healing and sustain in the team fight."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Just look to pick off enemies with your abilities when possible. It will help make team fights really unfair for the enemy team.\n\nTry to poke enemies out before all-in'ing them. You may need to get the Blue Buff to ensure you have enough mana to keep up the ability spamming.\n\nUse your Ultimate R to pick enemies off when possible. This would be a remarkable ability to use when you see an enemy on a side lane."}
{"text": "As lissandra, At level 9, the Lissandra Q will be maximized. This means that it will do tons of damage now, especially in the grouped combats. Lissandra is really good in the team fights. She can easily CC high priority targets and win a team fight alone due to her AoE and Passive abilities. Her Ultimate R at level 11 will provide her with a lot of selection potential. She can use this ability frequently, which means that team fights and choices will be quite frequent."}
{"text": "As ornn, The second point in his Ultimate R will increase the damage of the ability and will let him make plays frequently.\n\nMultiple items will allow him to soak up a lot of damage in fights. He should be a part of as many fights as possible.\n\nThe first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will deal a lot of damage to the enemy team and increase the frequency of using that ability. Anyone near terrain will have a tough time.        "}
{"text": "As warwick, Warwick can gank early enough, especially if it manages to reach level 3 and has access to all its capabilities. Once done, it should be able to stop the overstretched enemies with ease. Level 6 is a massive power peak because it allows it to choose targets. The range on this capability is huge, which makes it quite effective in the fog of war. Warwick's objective control is really high. This is mainly due to its healing Q, which allows it to take neutral goals really quickly."}
{"text": "As darius, You should focus on getting level 3 quickly and then see if you can gank pushed-up enemies regularly. It should be quite easy if you can bypass the vision set by the enemy team.\n\nWhen dueling enemies, you must check the enemy's inventory so that you don't get bamboozled by early Grievous Wounds. You will want to avoid fighting with enemies having such items.\n\nYou must try to counter gank as much as you can as his kit facilitates it. Once you get your Ultimate e, you should be extremely efficient in skirmishes.        "}

This is especially true if she is going for the AD build.\n\nCan\u2019t be very effective if the enemy sets proper vision around and can notice Neeko changing her forms or hiding in a brush to land her E.\n\nDue to her pushing power, she can be very susceptible to ganks especially after she has used up her W."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Mordekaiser will take some time to be really overpowering in the lane, so he will need to play safely for that duration. Conserving health is the way to go.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive spike for Mordekaiser as he can now use his Ultimate R and 1 v 1 anyone he desires.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to fight more efficiently. His damage will be pretty significant as well.        "}
{"text": "Against brand, Stealing away Brand\u2019s blue buff will make it really hard for him to clear his camps easily. Try to take it as often as you can.\n \nBrand has a weak clear if the enemy hasn\u2019t been kiting camps effectively. You can use this to your advantage by trying to invade him in the early game if you\u2019re strong.\n\nBe on the lookout for surprise Brand damage when roaming around the map. Thanks to his E Q W combo, he can lock you down and blow you up if he attacks from an unwarded bush. Do not get caught out by the amount of surprise burst damage he can deal."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Miss Fortune has tons of poke with her t. She can also use her t to blow up enemies in the way. Her Ultimate e is awesome when paired with team compositions with a lot of CC because she can inflict tons of AOE damage to the enemy. She will win self-attack trades with the enemy in the bot track. Even if she builds AP, she will always beat the enemy Support during the automobile trade."}
{"text": "As yasuo, His W is almost useless against you, because only your d can be blocked by it, but he can also save his death by having him almost always out of the water down. Try not to stay close to your minion wave, because Yasuo can use it as a way to close the distance and make trades favorable for him. Let Yasuo push the wave to levels 1-5, because he can't really trade you under turn unless he has the help of the jungle, and use these windows to make it fall using your d and self-attacks."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Similarly, make sure to use Flash to escape its Ultimate R so that it cannot get reset and win the fight. Watch the flanks when Pyke sitting targets, can attack on the side or take someone with his Q and win the fight. When no team fight occurs, Pyke will be in a lateral drive by division. Keep an eye on his positioning and back if you see him turning to join the fight."}
{"text": "Against lulu, Lulu\u2019s early game can be incredibly difficult to play against if you\u2019re a melee champion. Opt for sustain and defensive stats in the early game.\n\nOnce Lulu has completed her first item, her protection and shielding ability will increase dramatically. At this stage, she will also do a hefty amount of damage when trading.\n\nTeam fights are where Lulu shines thanks to her E and Ultimate R which can be used on her allies. She will be building items that protect herself and her allies too, so she will be a huge threat."}
{"text": "As aphelios, Now you can start saving up on your Infernum ammo as the Ultimate R will come in really handy during an objective fight.\n\nAlthough you have hit one of your power spikes, you will still have to maintain your distance from enemy champions who have hard CC in their kit. You may also need to be reactive (Flashing when someone uses Flash to try and CC you) and build appropriately (Grievous Wounds for example).\n\nDon't mess up the lane assignments and try to stay mid when possible. The lane is shorter and will allow you to escape assassination attempts with ease while being able to farm easily. You will also be able to get mid priority which can be translated to objectives."}
{"text": "As shen, Shen is weak before reaching level six as he is mixed, and his all-in is highly dependent on his landing E on his enemies. He will miss he will take a lot of damage to his laner. Once he gets his Ultimate R, he will have a lot of map presence. He can quickly turn the tide of a fight with a Ultimate R in time to save his port. The first element should allow Shen to increase his survival and damage in the track. Track brushes should be used frequently to catch the out-of-guard enemy and secure dead."}
{"text": "As syndra, Level 16 is a massive peak for it because it can decimate the squishy enemies. This will allow it to bring down the main enemy teammates. It will have most of its capabilities maximized during this phase of the game. This means that it will be a persistent threat wherever it goes. The enemy will have to invest massively in the magic resistance. Syndra will have many articles during this phase of the game, which will directly result in damage for it. Its ability to deposit a lot of damage will keep the enemy on their toes."}
{"text": "Against jax, Aim to trade when Jax has used his e as it will block basic attacks. It has a long cooldown, so make sure you exploit his weakness.\n\nJax has no build-in sustain and is melee. If you have the range advantage, try to poke and harass him as much as possible to prevent him from looking for the all-in. This will also force him to burn through his potions quickly.\n\nAfter level 6, every third auto will deal extra magic damage. Do not commit to extended trades with him- especially if he\u2019s been able to stack his auto attacks on minions beforehand. "}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen isn't powerful early on, so she must use her Q to its full potential in the lane. It will give her a lot of sustain and damage, but she will need to invest some time stacking it.\n\nGwen's level 6 is a significant powerspike for her. She can quickly run down enemies now as the amount of healing she gets from the damage output of the ability is quite potent. She should be winning a duel with ease from now on.\n\nGetting the first component will surely help Gwen's laning phase a lot. Her damage output will increase, which will let her go for short burst trades on her enemy with her E and Q. She can later use her W to escape."}
{"text": "Against fiora, Fiora's Passive can make a huge difference when trading with her. If you\u2019re unhappy with the area marked, walking back a certain distance will reset the position. \n\nPlaying around Fiora's W is a focal point of the lane. Try baiting it out before you all in her to prevent her from neglecting your CC.\n\nKeeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map will make it very hard for her to chase you down and kill you in lane. If you push and she freezes, you will be very vulnerable to ganks and all-ins from Fiora."}
{"text": "Against brand, Brand is really strong at level 2 and 3 when he gets access to more abilities. Be prepared to back off slightly when he gets the level up so you don\u2019t risk losing your health bar.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Brand gets thanks to the items he\u2019ll get. Try to set him behind in the early game to reduce his gold income and prevent a snowball.\n\nOnce Brand hits level 6, his damage output and ability to kill you will be much higher thanks to his Ultimate R. If you are low, make sure you recall as he can easily burst you down and kill you."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 9, Ezreal maximizes his Q. He will be strong enough at this stage of the game thanks to the additional damage his Q will make and the items he would have picked up by then. Putting the second point in Ezreal, Ultimate R at level 11 will offer him a lot of additional damage. He will also be able to threaten the flights on major goals like Baron or Dragons. Ezreal is really good to bring down enemies before a fight thanks to its low temperature reductions and overall damage."}
{"text": "As sion, In team combat, it can be put into a kit to death by any transport range that the enemy team has. If the enemy is intelligent and puts the vision in the track brushes, he will not be able to count on his Q to poke/start an all-in-one. Its handling decreases while using its Ultimate R, which makes it difficult for him to land when the enemy is out in the open and has some form of dash or flash."}
{"text": "As trundle, Level six is a decent power spike for Trundle as he can now take duels and them easily. It will also let him affect team fights massively.\n\nHe isn't powerful during the early game, so he should aim at taking short burst trades when possible and retreat quickly using his e and e.\n\nThe first component will allow him to survive fights and dish out a lot of damage during duels. He should be able to take frequent fights now.        "}
{"text": "As zac, Xin Zhao will have two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. It will allow him to use the ability more often, making it easier for him to convert fights into a 1 v 1 as and when required.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out by the time he hits level 9. This is a crucial power spike as it massively increases his damage output and dueling capacity.\n\nXin is excellent in team fights and picking of enemies due to his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to single out enemies, allowing him to be immune from ranged carries.        "}
{"text": "Against soraka, Soraka will go to ward alone during the mid-game. You can abuse this by looking to ambush her as she goes to ward an objective. While she is dead, you could force a fight or take an objective with the numbers advantage. \n\nInvest in an Executioner\u2019s Calling or Morellonomicon if your champion benefits from it. This will reduce Soraka\u2019s healing potential from her W and Ultimate R to help you win the team fight.\n\nAs Soraka will be positioned in the backline, it will be difficult for you to take her down fast. To make killing her easier, try to flank from the side rather than running directly towards her in a team fight."}
{"text": "As nocturne, He is frail pre-six because he has no way to gap close and get close to his enemies. He should powerfarm as much as possible.\n\nHis strength skyrockets post-six as he can gank the enemy reliably. He should focus on lanes where his allies have some form of hard CC or where the enemy is too pushed up.\n\nThe first item component will increase his clear speeds and let him deal a lot of damage in a very brief amount of time. This is quite helpful when ganking.        "}
{"text": "As volibear, Volibear's early game ganks are pretty solid, provided he can play around vision properly. Once he unlocks his basic abilities, he should easily gank any lane where the enemy is overextended.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant power spike for Volibear. This is mainly because of his ability to initiate fights independently and instigate tower dives with ease. Any low-health squishy target will be forced to play safely and recall abruptly.\n\nVolibear's objective control is pretty good too. He can quickly clear his camps and take neutral objectives with ease if an opportunity presents itself. His E will help him a lot when taking these objectives.        "}
{"text": "As missfortune, Miss Fortune\u2019s first major power spike is once she hits level 4/5. This is because she would\u2019ve put multiple points in her t which can deal a lot of damage to a squishy enemy.\n\nWhen Miss Fortune has completed her first component item, her damage output will increase dramatically and she can easily blow the enemy up when she has more levels under her belt.\n\nAt level 6, Miss Fortune will unlock her Ultimate e. This in conjunction with her t will deal a lot of damage to the enemy in a short amount of time. Look to poke the enemy down and then channel your Ultimate e to finish them off.\n"}

It should let him afflict team fights way easily, primarily if he is split pushing in another lane.\n\nHis tankiness is really high during the mid-game, and he should be able to be the frontline for his team quite effectively. His Q and W should allow him to soak up a lot of damage as well.\n\nThe first ability will be maxed out at level 9.

{"text": "As trundle, Focus on early farming. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.

{"text": "Against viego, Viego's skirmish power is quite high in the game of the time. Keep this in mind by trying to 1v1 him as he is pretty good early. Viego's level 6 is very good. He will often go for incredibly aggressive games with his Ultimate R. If he takes the body of a fed enemy champion, he will be extremely difficult to manage. However, if he takes control of a weak champion, he may not be so great of a threat."}
{"text": "As pantheon, At level 6, you get a massive power peak on Pantheon, since its R is not a real power peak for Pantheon. Use the pressure it provides to threaten all the ins on it. When Pantheon engages on you, use your abilities and then AA him until his abilities are back, then run in your turn. Pantheon will probably try to use his Q on every opportunity presented to him. You can put his damage in reserve early with your Passive if you need."}
{"text": "As azir, You are extremely squishy and hence are really weak to all-ins from the enemy team. The danger increases when you don't have your Ultimate R ready.\n\nDue to your soldier positioning mechanic, any enemy champion who has a dash, or some other form of mobility spell, can prove to be a really hard target to catch out and kill for you.\n\nYour own mobility can turn out to be a weak point for you. If the enemy manages to bait out your R in an aggressive way and then the enemy Jungler shows up for a gank, you will have a really hard time getting out of the situation without your Ultimate R. "}
{"text": "As maokai, It can even hide in them to all enemies when they are pushed up. Level six will allow it to initiate combat more reliably, especially when setting up ganks. The Jungler ally will have an easy time to ruin this way. The first element will allow Maokai to survive longer and avoid more serious damage in the way. It just has to make sure that it does not get blown up before a fight."}
{"text": "As sylas, You are much stronger than Sylas early. Invade him and try to fight him in the 1v1. Make sure you apply as much pressure as possible by often gauntling in the beginning of the game. Remember to take these goals. Unlike Sylas, you can solo these goals quite easily. If you see Sylas gaunting nearby, don't be afraid to counter the gank."}
{"text": "As ekko, When Ekko hits level 3, he can start to look for aggressive plays as he would\u2019ve unlocked all 3 of his basic abilities. Until that time, he can fight, but he will unlikely gain any significant advantage.\n\nAs Ekko can deal a lot of burst damage, once he has completed his Mythic item, his kill pressure intensifies.\n\nAt level 6, Ekko becomes an incredible threat. He can go for risky plays and use his Ultimate R to escape. His Ultimate R can also be used aggressively, which makes it incredibly versatile. You can look for riskier all-ins post 6 as long as you cast your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As lulu, Hit level 2 first and then use your level advantage to gain a significant health lead.\n\nYou need to get some healing reduction as soon as possible. If you don\u2019t, then Lulu will just out sustain and heal back all the damage you do to them or the ADC\n\nTheir Ultimate offers them a ton of additional kill pressure. Play smart and recall when you\u2019re low so Lulu cannot use their Ultimate on their ADC to gain a kill in lane.\n\nBait out abilities before looking to fight Lulu. They can turn around exchanges, and to make trading more favourable, you should wait for them to use one of their abilities before fighting them."}

You really don't have to panic unless he manages to slow you, at which point you can just dash away.\n\nKeep chipping on his health bar with your Q in this matchup. It is the only surefire way to keep yourself safe in this matchup and prevent Trynd from regularly all-in'ing you.\n\nPost six, you can easily chain CC Trynd with your ult in such a way that he won't be able to use his ult. Just make sure that you ult him into you when he is around 20% HP, and then follow it up with your dash CC.

{"text": "As varus, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Push and constantly push the enemy with your abilities. Once they are low, you can look for an aggressive all-in. However, while the murders are pleasant, your goal is to poke and not commit to fight. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a golden lead."}
{"text": "As gragas, Focus on the harassment of your enemy blazing with your Q in the way. Bonus points if you can also erase the wave with it. Your E should help you a lot in this way, but use it carefully. Ward around before going for an all-in, you will become an easy gank target. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should have a lot more efficiency in the enemy duel. An excellent way to bait the enemy will be to first let the wave push, and then as they are on the point of all-in you, you use your Ultimate R on them and bring them into your turn.

It should be easy enough to shoot in view of how your ult works, but make sure to push Nasus out of the way before roaming. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy does not have some kind of sieving potential and can be easily exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "Against karthus, Once Karthus has its Ultimate e, it can impact the map regardless of its positioning. Every time you fight the enemy, always take into consideration that it can use its Ultimate e to finish you. The more the AP and the more magical penetration Karthus gets, the better and the more it will be. Try to close it or constantly invade it to reduce its gold revenues. Once Karthus has finished its juggling, its death pressure and its ability to gank will increase."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, In team fights, as soon as Aatrox runs in, try to CC him and burst him down first. He is pretty vulnerable to CC, and if you can kill him before he gets his combo off, the enemy will lose out on a lot of damage.\n \nTry to look for fights when Aatrox doesn\u2019t have his Ultimate or Flash. He will have a much harder time at impacting fights when either of these are on cooldown.\n \nAatrox likes to split push after the laning phase has ended.

He can use it to soak up so much damage without the risk of dying, and he can quickly remount if Skaarl flees.\n\nKled will have his build almost completed by now. This means that he will be tanky, as well as dish out heavy amounts of damage. Anyone who gets caught out by him will probably end up dying.\n\nSince all his abilities will be maxed at this point, Kled will be huge in the game. His ability to disrupt the enemy teams' ranks will be phenomenal, and he can easily peel for his carries as well."}

If your team is not in advance or not very strong, you could try to divide the thrust and attract the attention of enemies while your team sits a goal elsewhere or does the Baron. Kassaddin is very good to get choices thanks to its Ultimate k. Look for choices in the late part to get your team before."}

Once set back during the early game, he won\u2019t be able to dish out a lot of damage.\n\nOn missing his E, Mordekaiser\u2019s opponents can easily all-in and engage on him. This is because he won\u2019t be able to displace the enemy team, and the carries will be able to freely all-in him.\n\nEarly Grievous Wounds can reduce his W damage by a lot.

It will be able to affect team fighting quickly, and its zoning potential will increase considerably to ensure that its backline remains safe at all times. Swain will have the opportunity to impact team fighting during the middle of the game, mainly neutral objective combat a lot. This is very beneficial to him, given the AoE aspect of his Ultimate R. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will increase its burst damaged by many and it will be easier for him to secure peaks on isolated enemy targets."}

You have a lot of poke, so try to poke the enemy down as often as you can.\n\nPlay safe for the first few levels while you land poke on the enemy with your 2. Once they\u2019re low enough, you can commit to an all-in.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve hit level 6 and purchased key component items, look to harass and constantly push the enemy into their tower. This will allow you to earn turret plating and increase your gold income. "}
{"text": "As taliyah, After your bot track has moved halfway, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. Try to sit goals with your team in the middle of the game. You have strong pose tools that will allow you to sit goals with ease. Try to bring down the enemy as much as possible while your team tries to take turns (or the Dragon or Baron)."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Putting the second point in Fiddlesticks Ultimate R at level 11 is very important to him. It will put his Ultimate R on a shorter cooldown and allow him to look for more aggressive pieces. At this stage of the game, Fiddlesticks should have finished one or two articles. Its damage release will be quite high that will allow him to win team fights mid-game. In the middle of the game, the teams start to regroup. It's good for Fiddlesticks because he benefits from teams regrouping closely because his Ultimate R is an AOE tool."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax needs time to come online. Although he can trade in the early game, it's best to get a few levels behind you before looking for a murder. Be ready to scale if you're in a difficult matchup so that you don't fall behind and become useless in the later parts of the game. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card in difficult matchesups. Jax will find it really difficult to survive the laning phase if it constantly pushes."}
{"text": "As olaf, Concentrate them with your other front-line champions. As you are the Jungler, you must make sure that you are still alive in the late match. If you will die before a major goal scares, the enemy will be able to take it. Make sure that you are still on the side of the map that the next major goal is safe. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Your goal in the early game is to gain as much gold and XP as quickly as you can. Focus on farming rather than ganking or fighting.\n\nLook to secure objectives as often as possible. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes along.\n\nYour Ultimate a is an incredibly strong tool. Whenever it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get kills."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's Ultimate R will really shine during this phase of the game as he can now impact team fights whenever that ability is up. Additionally, it works really well when his target is the one who must go near the enemies to attack them.\n\nAt level nine, his Q will be completely maxed out. This will give a massive boost to his damage and wave clear. In addition, he can now help other laners out frequently and keep his wave shoved in at all times.\n\nGalio will have his core items at this point. This is beneficial for him, and his team as his overall damage output and survivability will be higher."}
{"text": "As lux, As a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times.\n\nKeep a constant eye on what major objective is spawning next. If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nLook for picks during the mid-game. If you can pick someone off with the help from your allies, you can abuse their death timer to earn more gold and possibly take a tower, an objective or get more kills."}
{"text": "Against diana, Diana has a unique game style when it comes to agriculture and commerce during the start of the game. Its impact on the wave is strong and she will tend to push the wave with her. Try to engage and fight it when her s is on the cooldown. Diana is dependent on landing her Q for the all-in.

{"text": "Against rengar, During the middle of the game, avoid separating as Rengar will try to assassinate a target that is alone. Make sure to stay with your team to reduce their chances of taking someone. In the team fights, Rengar will try to shoot down an immobile target or squishy. Regardless of who you play, approach each other to reduce their chances of taking someone. If Rengar activates his Ultimate R in a team fight, be ready to disengage his Ultimate R is running out."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid grouping too closely if the enemy has several knock-ups as this will allow Yasuo to get a very good Ultimate Roff. The grouping but not standing on each other will reduce the effectiveness of his Ultimate R. Do not fight in the jungle because it will be easier for Yasuo to land his Tornado to hit and follow him with his Ultimate R. Fighting outdoors will make the team fight more effective for your team. CC is your best friend in team fighting."}

If you focus on the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly.

This is because he doesn't have much mobility, and enemies can easily walk away from him if they have a vision of him.\n\nPost-six, Singed gets a massive boost in his power as he gets a team fight impacting Ultimate n. It allows him to roam around and get ganks off as well.\n\nThe first item component will give a boost to his survivability and overall damage.

{"text": "As graves, Graves comes out on a scale and unless he has taken the lead at the beginning of the game, it is unlikely that he will take over in the later parts of the game. He is squishy and getting CC-D will get him killed very quickly. It is very beneficial for the enemy team, as they can concentrate him quickly, get rid of him, then go for neutral goals. The enemy lantern can prevent him from doing damage with his automatic attacks by hiding inside or behind the minions."}
{"text": "As gnar, Avoid being hit by his Q in this matchup. It does a lot of damage and can cause problems for you in this matchup. Once he gets his Ultimate, you will want to be very careful in this matchup. Not doing so can easily get you pined and killed. Short trades are usually a bad idea for you because of how your kit works and your lack of mobility. Try to get to the enemy rear line when possible to cause chaos. Keep the wave somewhere in the middle of the way. It will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down."}
{"text": "Against samira, Keep a constant eye on how many Style points she has. The closer to S rank, the more mobile she will be and the deadlier she can be too. Post 6, she cannot use her Ultimate R unless she is fully stacked on Style points\n\nSamira is an incredibly mobile champion. To reduce her mobility and increase your survivability, try and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will make it impossible for her to use her E aggressively. If you\u2019re a weak ADC in the early game, definitely keep the wave closer to your side of the map.\n\nPlaying around her W in lane is crucial as it can block projectiles (auto attacks). Whenever she uses this ability to trade with, try to abuse the cooldown and go for favourable trades."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, The first power peak of Xin Zhao in the track is at level 3. It can all-in the enemy at level 3 when it gets access to the 3 basic capabilities.

After Xin took its first component element, it can trade very aggressively with the enemy."}
{"text": "As sett, His early game ganks are quite decent during this phase of the game. His Q and E should let him get to his enemies quickly.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as it allows Sett to pick off one enemy and separate them from the team.

{"text": "As kayle, Play safely in the game early. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you'll have trouble in the line and you'll delay your first major power peak. Focus on electric farming and minimize trading up to your level 6. Once you unlock your Ultimate R, you can start to be more aggressive. Once you're level 6, you can look at playing more aggressive than you can use your Ultimate R as a trading tool and something to come back on."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass."}
{"text": "Against ahri, Ahri is rather weak in the early game. Look to poke and fight her during this time to get a good start from the get-go.\n \nPost-6, Ahri has a lot of chase potential thanks to her Ultimate.\n \nDo not overextend when you\u2019re low as she can easily kill you and set you behind. Once Ahri has completed her first item, she will deal a lot of damage and be able to push the wave/ fight more frequently. Keep this in mind and respect her all-in damage."}
{"text": "As amumu, Try to power farm to level 6. This will help you unlock your Ultimate y quickly and allow you to start ganking your lanes.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate y is up, you should try to gank a lane. Every Ultimate y use should result in a kill. Try to gank as soon as your Ultimate y comes off cooldown.\n\nAfter successfully ganking the bottom lane, make the call to take the Dragon. Getting all the Dragons will give you an early soul and deny the enemy a variety of buffs."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble is very immobile and prone to all-ins. Try to freeze the wave closer to your side of the map. This will force him to overextend for farm, which can allow you to all-in him, deny him from farm or even set up your Jungler for an easy takedown.\n\nRumble is rather squishy early and suffers heavily when his r is on cooldown as he will lack damage. Looking to fight after he uses his r will make trading easier for you.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate Rumble\u2019s damage in a trade. If you get hit by multiple e\u2019s and stand in his r for too long, he will dish out a lot of damage. "}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm Kench's first game is not strong because he will not be able to protect his ADC during this point. He will do a lot of damage to the enemy, provided he did not come out early. Level 6 is a massive power peak because it offers both lethal pressure and defensive measures for his partner of the track. This means that he can try everything in the enemy on his own now. Level 3 is another important power peak because it gives him access to all his basic capabilities. This means that he can do much more in the way while using the track brushes. Unfortunately, he will not be able to use his Passive well enough, however."}
{"text": "As varus, At level 11, Varus will be able to add 2 points to his Ultimate R. This allows Varus to take enemies, especially when Varus tries to trade tracks. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will allow him to do a lot of damage to his opponents in the way. This will also give him the incentive to carry for his team if he is already in advance. Varus and Ultimate R's AoE poke do disastrous battles for the enemy team. They will suffer if Varus manages to obtain an excellent Ultimate R in neutral and objective combats."}
{"text": "As yone, It's not early against the various matches because it can be swiped quite easily. Regular Poking will eventually get him killed if he stays in the way. He can overplay with his E if he goes and bad time the E duration. Control of the crowd is his mortal enemy, and he can be removed quite easily due to his squishiness. His ultimate R doesn't have much width, which makes it really easy for enemies to avoid him from range. This will require Yone to get closer to the enemy team, who can put him in a vulnerable position."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Ezreal\u2019s E is very versatile and can allow him to go for aggressive plays or escape sticky situations. He is a very safe Support.\n\nHis Ultimate R is on a short cooldown and can be used frequently when trading with the enemy. It is also global which allows him to snipe people across the map.\n\nEzreal has consistent poke damage with his W and Q which can allow him to push the enemy laners out of the lane abruptly. This can also allow him to all-in enemies once they are low enough after taking the barrage of poke Ezreal has to offer."}
{"text": "As zed, Look to CC him when possible. It is his bane of existence and will let you win the game easily.\n\nMake sure you apply as much pressure as you can early by matching his ganking power and trying to gank as often as possible.\n\nPlace wards all around the map when possible in this matchup. It will allow you to detect Zed and know his whereabouts.\n\nCounter ganking him is of paramount importance in this matchup. Failing to do so will let your team fall behind significanlty."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 16, Ezreal will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will do a lot of damage to anyone touched with her in the last game. When Ezreal comes to the end of his construction, he will have incredibly low cooling on all his abilities. It's good for him because he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight happens. Moreover, his E will be on a short cooling that allows him to easily escape from the skirmishes. Ezreal is awesome in the middle of the game, but he starts to fall in the last game because it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}
{"text": "As corki, Corki is really good in team fights thanks to the AOE poke from his b and Ultimate e. \n\nHe can be good post 6 as he has a lot of poke and wave clear.

{"text": "As galio, Stay near your team at all times in the late game. While your Ultimate R has a long range, the enemy may force a fight when you show elsewhere on the map.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R and wait for one of your allies to engage. Once they\u2019ve gone in, use your Ultimate R on them. Alternatively, wait for the enemy to engage and then cast your Ultimate R on a carry.\n\nPeel for your carries in late game team fights.

{"text": "Against khazix, It can achieve solo goals like the Dragon or Rift Herald with ease thanks to its Q. Make sure you keep these goals monitored so you can spot it if it tries to take them. During the fight against Kha-Zix, unless you have the lead, avoid fighting it when there are no minions or jungle camps nearby. Thanks to its passive, it will do you more damage if you are isolated with no one around."}
{"text": "As ornn, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As kennen, Level 6 is really strong for Kennen because it gets access to an AoE CC capability that can quickly turn the tide of a fight. Kennen should try to flank the enemies for maximum efficiency. Its first element of the element will significantly increase its damage. Kennen is unpleasant for its poke damage, and the element will only improve it. Kennen is not very early because it only relies on AP to maximize its poke damage. He will want to use the track brushes to catch the out-of-guard enemy whenever possible."}
{"text": "As kennen, It can be shot down gradually, which will force it to get out of the way, or it can be all-in-one by the enemy lantern and the Jungler/Support. Once its h is lowered, it becomes a gank target if it is too pushed. This will allow its laner to get a free murder on it, especially if its laner manages to use a wave management technique to bait Kennen. Reliefs on the flanks to obtain team battle victories so good vision on the enemy side. This will prevent it from entering the backline of the enemy team and doing huge damage."}
{"text": "As braum, Braum can be harassed easily by various champions during the laning phase. You need to position properly at all times so that you are not forced to remember or play safely. When Braums E is down, he and his ADC are vulnerable to attack. He should not be using his E unless he also has. Every time he is downstairs he should play safer. Braum relies more on his team than a lot of tank Supports. That's because he lacks a commitment tool- even if his Ultimate R can be used as a selection tool."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, In the way, always make sure that there is a minion between you and him at any time to make it really difficult for him to land his g. When you play as a varied champion, try to abuse your automatic attack range to make it fall and win a healthy track. Do not engage too much in poking however. If you play as a utility support, try to take Relic Shield instead of Spelltheifs Edge to make the laning phase safer."}
{"text": "As maokai, In the mid-game, your main goal will be to look for as many picks as you can. Work with your Support to help them ward while planting your E sapling in the Jungle brushes.\n\nYou should be really tanky during this phase of the game. Peeling for your carries should be your primary goal after you manage to initiate the team fights.\n\nThe river and choke points would be a great place to fight as your abilities will lock down multiple enemies. Just go in on the highest priority target and try to CC lock them."}
{"text": "As rumble, You will want to avoid fighting it when its resource bar is more than half filled in this matchup. You will take a lot of damage differently. Use your Passive correctly with your e. Also, make sure you CC when its resource bar is about to be half filled, and step back immediately. Do not enter without your team close during the fights. This is to make sure you do not separate from your team. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy does not have some sort of screening potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As zeri, Good versus team compositions with lots of shields.\n\nHer E allows her to escape sticky situations and get away from ganks easily.\n\nZeri\u2019s versatile. She can either go AP or AD depending on her team\u2019s needs.\n"}

Try to secure the goals as often as possible in early play."}
{"text": "Against skarner, Skarner can start crashing at level 3 or 4 and can also take the Void Grubs very easily. Its first major power peak is level 6 however, when it unlocks its Ultimate.

The only way to counter this is by making sure you get pen pieces."}
{"text": "Against bard, Try not to let him harass and harass you for free otherwise you will never be able to engage or fight him- especially if you are melee. Bard's level 6 is not as strong as some champions as his Ultimate R does not damage. If you have a harmful Ultimate, you will be able to beat him at level 6. Or, you will at least force him to use his Ultimate R defensively. As the game progresses, Bard becomes stronger and stronger as he collects more chimes. Keep this in mind during the game against him."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Try not to use your Q in the middle of the way to make sure that you can regularly launch several pellets of your Q. Your C will be convenient during this phase of the game.

This means that his one-shot potential will be increased massively, and he will be able to destroy isolated enemies with ease.\n\nAt level 9, Zed will have his first ability maxed out.

{"text": "As chogath, Cho-Gath has great objective control and can secure every Drake with its Ultimate t. Has great support in the jungle thanks to its Passive. Tons of CC integrated with its e and m. This makes it a huge threat during the scam or escarment with the enemy."}
{"text": "Against senna, Senna will try to dominate you in the early game. Expect to play aggressively at level 1 to gain a health advantage. Once Senna is level 6, her card pressure and kill pressure increases. Ping once she is level 6 so your team knows she can influence a fight with her Ultimate R. The more the game goes, the stronger Sennas Passive will be. Try to finish it as fast as you can that her late game is strong enough if she was able to stack effectively."}
{"text": "Against galio, Avoid regrouping closely in team fighting as this can allow Galio to get a 5 man with his R once one of his allies has engaged. Space between each other for maximum survival from the go. If Galio uses his Ultimate R when you are close to him, you can disturb him with any crowd control capability. This will be very useful as it can prevent him from using his Ultimate R to help his allies."}
{"text": "As lulu, Team up with your team during this phase of the game and make sure you can land consistent DPS on enemies. Your ultimate R should be saved for yourself, but exceptions are applicable if one of your doors is in danger. Use your W wisely during this phase of the game. This ability can completely change the result of a fight if you use it at a good time. An appropriate time would be to ruin the combo of complete damage of a mage by W 'ing them. During neutral, objective fighting, stay somewhere near your Jungler so that they are not taken off during or before a fight. Losing crucial goals will certainly lead to your loss if you are not careful enough."}

Continue kiteing in team fights and systematically adapt your positioning."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 6, Ezreal will unlock its Ultimate R. Its Ultimate R is an excellent tool at all stages of the game. It allows it to inflict a considerable amount of damage to anyone on the card. After Ezreal on first return, it will recover its first component. Its release of damage will intensify and it can look for more aggressive parts once it has it. When Ezreal completes its Mythic element, its release of damage will increase again. A good Ezreal will seek to bring down the enemy with his Q before launching a whole."}
{"text": "As kindred, Avoid team fighting in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting when it is on the cooldown is a big no and can cost you the game. When in advance, look for peaks while waiting in the high traffic areas for an enemy to pass.

{"text": "Against darius, Darius is one of the best duels in the game, so don't go beyond your welcome. Don't go for prolonged jobs with him as he will always go out ahead. Darius will seek to reposition himself using his e. Try and stay in the inner ring so he doesn't inflict much damage. Darius is relatively motionless and weak when he is attacked by several champions."}
{"text": "As rumble, His lack of mobility makes him an easy target versus assassins and strong skirmishing champions.\n\nRumble\u2019s effectiveness is drastically decreased when his Passive is not half-filled.\n\nIn some matchups, he will get invaded over and over again due to his weak very early game. When in these matchups, you have to sacrifice a lot to stay alive.\n"}
{"text": "As ezreal, This can also allow it to go up to all enemies once they are low enough after taking the Poke Ezreal Dam has to offer. Its Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during early play to wave. This is very useful when it tries to clear the wave quickly in order to get a reminder. Ezreal=\"E allows it to exit sticky situations with ease and makes it one of the safest ADCs in the game. It can also buffer it in response to the CC capabilities that will allow it to avoid following CC if it manages to get the initial CC capability."}
{"text": "As nautilus, To maintain parity in the laning phase, aim to hit Level 2 at the same time as Nautilus. This ensures that you and your ADC have access to all your abilities and can better respond to any aggression of the enemy duo. When Nautilus wanders, be proactive in pinging and communication with your team. Alert them to his absence from the track, as he can be a powerful force in the ganking of other tracks. This allows your teammates to play more defensively and avoid potential interactions or roaring Nautilus. When you are detached from your ADC, keep in mind your position to avoid clinging to the Q of Nautilus. Position yourself behind the minions or out of range to minimize the risk of being caught and engaged. Enjoy your reach advantage like Yuumi when Nautilus Q is on cooldown. During this window, you can harass and harass him with your abilities."}
{"text": "As gnar, He is a lane bully and can make the life of melee top laners a very hard one. With his ranged poke and his Q, he can keep chipping on his opponent while they try to farm, and force them out of the lane.\n\nHis E allows him to disengage and ruin all-in attempts on him from the enemy team. This makes it very hard for the enemy Jungler to gank him unless the top laner is able to land their CC on him.\n\nHis Ultimate R can change the tide of an entire fight. When combined with his E, he can quite easily CC the entire enemy team when they are clumped up together."}
{"text": "As graves, Graves is not quite strong during the early game because the enemy can use the minions to block his attacks. He can compensate for that by consistently thinning out the wave and using his e in a way that he can reposition himself properly to attack his laner.\n\nOnce he gets to level 6, he will have unlocked a huge finishing move. It can take out multiple targets with utmost ease should he go for the lethality build. The ability also provides him a means to escape when his e is down.\n\nGraves will get a decent power spike once he gets his first component. It will increase his dueling potential, and he will be close to the phase where he can practically one-shot anyone."}
{"text": "As sivir, The incorrect use of her E will make her kill in the track sooner or later. The spell will not work very effectively if the enemy has tainted the control of the crowd. She is very still, so catching her out of sight will easily result in a murder for the enemy team. This will remove a large amount of wave released from the Svir team. It is highly dependent on critical strike elements and will be put back in place if the enemy manages to kill her a few times in the track. She is also weaker against the grouped teams, as she was unable to get a choice on someone with her Ultimate R and team."}
{"text": "As sylas, Level 16 will see Sylas procuring a fully maxed out Ultimate R. The power of his Ultimate R will still depend on the enemy team comp, but he will be able to use more ultimates in a given time.\n\nHis damage will be really significant during this phase of the game. The burst damage he can deal will completely catch enemies off-guard and ruin their chances of winning the game.\n\nSylas is quite decent during the late-game fights as he can deal tons of damage and heal himself for massive amounts at the proper time. It will let him separate the enemy front line from the backline and help his team a lot."}
{"text": "As zed, The first item procurement will make Zed a deadly champion to deal with. He should be looking to roam to other lanes and clean up kills on low-health/overstaying enemies.\n\nLevel 3 is a decent power spike as Zed will now have access to his overall burst combo. He can quickly go for short burst trades and proc his runes with these abilities. He can spam them quite fast as well since he is not dependent on mana.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant power spike for Zed. This is where he unlocks his full potential and can make the plays and the moves to make enemies wonder what that was. He should also be able to dive low health enemies and escape unscathed."}
{"text": "As darius, Keep the minion wave close to your side of the lane. This reduces his ability to run you down in lane and prevents him from zoning you away from farm.\n\nBe prepared to sacrifice CS for XP and health against Darius. Only last hit minions what you can withut losing health. It's not worth over extending, over greeding for a couple minions when he can just pull you in with E and start a fight.\n\nDo not go for extended trades with Darius period. He is incredibly strong thanks to his Passive which makes 1v1 duels extremely difficult for you. Keep trades short and sweet when neccessary.\n\nHit level 2 and 3 at the same time as Darius. He has a very strong all in at these levels and if you're under leveled compared to him- he might look for the fight. Hit level 2 (the first 7 minions) at the same time as him to reduce his chances of trading."}
{"text": "As xerath, Very motionless and sensitive to the control of the crowd of the enemy team, especially when it loads its p up. Can easily be all-in-one if it uses its r with caution and it does not have its Flash up. Can be flanked with ease when it is pushed up in the track due to its in-build wavollelar. Its Ultimate 2 can easily be interrupted and can be used as a traction to target it and get rid of it immediately. Xerath will have to position well before using its Ultimate 2 , otherwise there is a good chance that it will get killed immediately."}
{"text": "As nunu, His tankiness is really high during the mid-game. He can absorb a lot of damage and then regenerate a lot of health using his Q.\n\nMultiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to dish out a lot of damage, especially in grouped fights.\n\nHis team fighting is extreme as he can disrupt the enemy team with his snowball and his Ultimate R        "}
{"text": "Against bard, Bard will leave lane to pick up Chimes when it\u2019s safe. Abuse the fact that he is missing to all-in the enemy ADC.\n\nTry and stay away from the minion wave at all times. This will make it really hard for him to land his Q and stun you. Don\u2019t stand too close to the wall so he can\u2019t stun you that way either.\n\nWhen playing as a melee champion, don\u2019t stand too close to him or the minion wave otherwise he can poke you down and harass you with basic attacks. Walk forward when you want to harass or last hit, but return back to safety afterwards."}
{"text": "As neeko, During the laning phase, it is really easy for you to steal your ADC farm. Very squishy and can easily be blown up by the enemy once it is locked. Can it be very effective if the enemy puts the right vision around and can notice Neeko changing shapes or hiding in a brush to land his E."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao is incredibly strong during the early game thanks to his E and Q. He will win most all-ins as long as he looks for favourable trades around abilities.\n\nHis Ultimate R is very effective against ranged members of the enemy team. This will force the enemy carries to come in melee range of him, which can be quite devastating for them.\n\nHas great all-in potential. If the enemy oversteps, he can close the gap and all-in them and take them down."}
{"text": "As taric, Once Taric manages to get his boots, he will be way more effective in roams and skirmishes. This is because he will stick to his target for a more extended period and stack up his Q.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant powerspike as Taric gains the ability to completely negate any form of damage from his entire team for a brief duration. This is perfect when dealing with heavy burst and engage-based teams.\n\nAt level 4, Taric will have two points in his Q. This is really beneficial as the amount of consistent healing it confers on him and his ADC/teammates can really change the tide of a fight."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Use the track brushes and keep hitting enemies with your E. The goal is to get as many Procs as you can in this way without taking a lot of damage in return. Your effigies should help you massively when it comes to setting up the vision around the map. Make sure that the track entrances are monitored and that you continue to hit the enemy relentlessly. Once you get your Ultimate R, your team fighting impact should increase massively. Use effigies and bamboozle enemies with surprise Ultimate R's on them."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Stay with your Support throughout the mid-game. If you move away from them, you will be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you\u2019re always near at least 1 ally.\n\nGroup and stay with your team at all times. Do not split push or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against zyra, Avoid standing in the minion wave at any time as this will allow Zyra to poke and push the minion wave at the same time. Harass Zyra when there are no W seeds around her. This will make it much harder for her to come back with you. At level 6, Zyras kills pressure greatly increases. Respect her pressure to kill at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As lulu, Group up with your team during this phase of the game and ensure that you can land consistent DPS on the enemies. Your Ultimate R should be saved for yourself, but exceptions are applicable if one of your carries is in danger.\n\nUse your W wisely during this phase of the game. That ability can completely change the outcome of a fight if you use it at a good moment. A proper moment would be to ruin a mage's full damage combo by W 'ing them.\n\nDuring neutral, objective fights, stay somewhere near your Jungler so that they don't get picked off during or before a fight. Losing crucial objectives will definitely lead to your loss if you're not careful enough."}
{"text": "As teemo, It can wander around the map and place its Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow it to detect enemies as well as get killed on unsuspecting low-health targets. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow it to inflict high amounts of bursting damage and will allow it to kill its enemies quickly. It is not remarkable in team fighting, so it should either resort to secure peaks and blow people with its abilities or just separate by pushing until the enemy responds to it."}
{"text": "As akshan, This is the phase of the game where you will be dealing a ton of damage. You can use your E more liberally to get some kills from now on.\n\nYour Ultimate will be on a short cooldown, so ensure that you use it quite frequently. It will definitely help you with chunking out enemies who have already taken some damage.\n\nIf you have allies who have CC built into their kit, try to stick near them. You should always focus on the CC'd target and kill them when you get a chance. Also, if the enemy has an assassin, try to shadow them and see if you can get the kill on them if they assassinate your allies."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Look for choices on enemies that move too far with your Ultimate R. Catching a person out might allow you to snow the ball in victory or a goal. Group up close to your team so you can use your Ultimate R without the enemy knowing you. Make sure to play around your Zhonyas Hurglass and your Ultimate R in the late part. Avoid fighting unless both of them are not available."}
{"text": "Against lucian, * Watch out for Lucian\u2019s Q as he will try to line it up so it hits the minion wave and you at the same time.\n* As Lucian is a ranged AD champion, when playing as a melee champion, be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP and health. Dying to Lucian in the early game will make it very hard for you to come back\n* Wait for Lucian to use his E before initiating a fight or trying to land CC. Whenever his E is down, he is much weaker and will find it harder for him to defend himself. "}
{"text": "As zeri, At level 16, Zeri will put the final point in her Ultimate R. Her Ultimate R will now inflict the maximum damage in the fights. Team fights are really where it shines. According to her construction, she will be really strong and will be able to do a ton of damage in a fight. At the end of the match, she should be close to full construction. As long as she positions well and kites, she will be very good in team fights."}
{"text": "As ornn, Just try to go for all-in with your Q & E track brushes whenever possible. The goal is to stay out of sight and catch the out-of-guard enemy. Once you get your Ultimate R, you will be able to set up parts from a long range. Make sure you time your second Ultimate R proc properly. If the enemy team is heavy on CC, make sure you use your W in time to completely deny the CC and continue with your all-in."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, His early game is pretty decent as he can just go for consistent all-in trades and get back to safety due to his y. He won't be taking a lot of damage either with proper usage of that ability.\n\nThe first item component is a decent spike as it bolsters his survivability and damage. It will help him take over the lane easily.\n\nLevel six is a massive spike as he can now impact team fights as a whole. He can also look for flanks and dive the enemy backline.        "}
{"text": "As lulu, Lulu can keep her allies alive for a long period of time with her E and Ultimate R in team fights. This increases her allies ability to deal damage and survive team fights.\n\nYou have a lot of poke thanks to your Q and E. This can allow you to win 1v1 fights with the enemy. You can also use your E to shield yourself rather than using it on the enemy.\n\nHas tons of utility that can assist her in a plethora of scenarios. Lulu is a solid pick and can fit into plenty of team compositions."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Be careful around the wave of minions because Yasuo will often use its E to pass through the wave of minions to reach you. Stay outside and away from the wave of minions at all times. If you play as a varied champion, try to use your range advantage to harass and bring it down. Don't commit too much to do this although it might look to turn the exchange around. Playing around Yasuo. Windwall W will make it much easier to kill him. If you can, try to lure this ability before engaging in the whole."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Very motionless and therefore vulnerable to crowd control in layers. He can't push freely unless he already knows where the enemy Jungler is, otherwise, he's just going to be killed. His E is his only source of self-peel. The abuse of him makes him much more vulnerable to all-in and can probably have him killed almost instantly if the enemy lantern has some kind of wink or mixed crowd control. His Ultimate R root in place, which makes it very easy for enemy champions with varying crowd control to interrupt his Ultimate R and get on him with their team."}
{"text": "As nilah, When her E is down, she is pretty easy to lock down and neither can she play aggressively.\n\nTo get the maximum use out of her Ultimate R, she needs her team to follow up or go in at the same time as her.\n\nLike most champions, Nilah is pretty weak when she is behind. Avoid falling behind if you can.\n"}
{"text": "As evelynn, Look to assassinate enemies with your Ultimate R. Catching someone out while they go to ward or move from one lane to another is a great way of getting ahead.\n\nFocus on securing objectives when possible in the mid-game. You can take them alone or with your team.\n\nLook for picks on enemies who are too far forward or alone. You can get right on top of them before they\u2019re able to react thanks to your Passive."}
{"text": "As belveth, Although she has a lot to offer, she really needs this attack speed to come online and if she is put too far back before she can get these few basic elements, she may never be able to recover. Bel-Eth relies heavily on her Q, her passive and her auto attacks to inflict the majority of her damage, this naturally means that she is incredibly countered by any form of hard CC. Her E is also a channel capacity that can also be interrupted by crowd control. If Bel-Eth does not get any grip on champions or goals in the teamfighters, she can never activate her True Form that is when it becomes so much harder to manage."}
{"text": "As skarner, At the end of the game, keep looking for flanks with your E and R. Play around your Ultimate cooldown in the end of the game. Avoid team fighting when your Ultimate is down to make sure you're useful in team fighting! Group with your allies as the enemy will just force a commitment and kill your team while you're not with them."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen will gain a huge power spike and finishing ability once he manages to get to level 6. This will let him go for regular short burst trades against his enemies, let his Passive kick in after the trade, and then go for the finish with his Ultimate R after getting the enemy low.\n\nGaren's first item component will either let him survive the lane for a more extended period (tank build) or increase his damage significantly (bruiser build). The former will let him take part in many team fights while the latter will help him with duels.\n\nGaren's build will dictate how he plays the game out. If he goes for the tank build, he will be nearly unkillable and can act as a perfect peel unit for his carries. On the other hand, if he goes for the bruiser build, he will be more dependent on the fog of war to catch enemies off guard and pick vital enemy carries."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes lots of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You need to play her a lot to make use of her kit.\n\nWhile she can deal a lot of damage and be a useful champion in team fights, she will not have as much gold or income to buy items like she would do in the Top role.\n\nWhen playing as Camille, she can get hard-countered by certain champions. Be mindful of picking her into champions that can counter her all-ins.\n"}
{"text": "As chogath, When your team isn\u2019t grouping or looking to fight, split push and farm up a storm in the side lane.\n\nLook for picks when you\u2019re grouped with your team with your m and e. After catching someone out, make the call for Baron.\n\nSecure objectives like the Dragon or Baron with your Ultimate t. If a major objective is up, hold off from using your Ultimate t to secure objectives. Additionally, avoid team fighting unless your Ultimate t is up as it deals tons of damage."}
{"text": "As nami, Levels 2 and 3 are decent spikes as Nami will catch out enemies and buff her ally's damage accordingly. It will help her take over the lane easily.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive spike as she can add another layer of CC to her entire CC combo. It will make up for an excellent follow-up CC ability.\n\nHer first item component will allow her to deal a lot of damage in the lane while also getting a decent amount of mana regeneration. She can now use her abilities frequently.        "}
{"text": "As janna, There is a stigma behind Janna's players. Ignore the haters! She is vulnerable to poke and engage. You have to be careful when it comes to trading and you will need to play around cooldowns so that you don't die when you try to harass the enemy-in particular with your basic attacks and d She relies on her team more than some other Supports like Leona or Thresh. If your team is behind, it will be harder to win on Janna."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, The Qiyana team's presence is huge thanks to its Ultimate R. Disperse yourself and don't fight in bottlenecks like in the jungle or under a lap to reduce its usefulness. When no team fight occurs, Qiyana will share the push. You can use this as an opportunity to engage in her team when she is unable to impact the fight. Keep an eye on her however and be prepared to remember if she gets closer to your turn. Burst and CC are your best friends in a team fight. As soon as she engages, try to lock her up with CC and bring her down so she is unable to lay down tons of damage and kill your teammates."}
{"text": "As viktor, His d is the only form of self-peel for him. Once that ability is down, he is quite vulnerable to ganks. In team fights, he can be flanked with ease as well.\n\nHe will be trying to play safe during the early game and will not have a lot of damage if he can\u2019t upgrade his Passive Core. Playing aggressively and forcing him out of the lane early on can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage on him.\n\nVery prone to all-ins, especially in the bot lane when against a hard crowd control Support. He has some form of movement speed buff with his r but layered crowd control can easily counter that."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Your Ultimate e makes you unqualified for a period of time. This makes it difficult to kill you who can give you time to kill the enemy. Is incredibly mobile that allows him to escape sticky situations, waste enemy time and overplay the enemy too. Trendamere is a large split and dualist pusher. It can 1v1 most enemy champions in a side track during the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As lillia, Keep you close so you can fight quickly. Keep playing around your cooldown Ultimate R and look for fights when it rises. Do not fight when it comes to cooldown because you will miss a lot of extra damage. In the late game, stay with your team and look for choices with your Ultimate R. If you are able to catch a champion out of position, you can take them and win the fight."}
{"text": "As syndra, Level 16 is a massive spike for her as she can decimate squishy enemies. It will allow her to take down core enemy teammates.\n\nShe will have most of her abilities maxed out during this phase of the game. This means that she will be a lingering threat wherever she goes. The enemy will have to invest heavily in Magic Resistance.\n\nSyndra will have many items during this phase of the game, which will directly translate into damage for her. Her ability to dish out a lot of damage will keep the enemy on their toes."}
{"text": "As nidalee, Another point in his Ultimate r will not provide him with a huge peak. It will give him some bonus statistics but nothing too special. His s will be maximized at level 9. This ability will hit like a truck now, but it will have to land it properly. Nidalee is extremely good in team fighting. Its ability to dry up a lot of brilliant damage and choose enemies with its s will make it difficult for the enemy to fight well."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, Avoid team fights around major goals if Seraphine is nearby. The tight grouping will benefit her and allow her to get a good Ultimate Roff and CC all your team. Similarly, avoid fighting in the jungle because your team will be grouped together, which can allow her to get another good Ultimate Roff. Try to fight in the open air and separate slightly so she can't CC your entire team. Seraphine will often go to the hall alone during the middle of the game. You can use this to your advantage to fight and choose her. While she's dead, you can look to take the Baron, a Dragon or look for a team fight with the advantage of numbers."}
{"text": "As ahri, Stand outside the minion wave so it can't push you and push you at the same time with its Q. Take care of Ahris E. While you have to stand outside the main wave, make sure you're close to the minion wave so it blocks its E. At level 6, it's much stronger than you and its all-in increases."}
{"text": "As karma, Its 2nd ability will be maximized at level 13. Depending on the maximum ability, it will be able either to CC enemies frequently while regenerating HP or easily protect its team from enemy poke and all in. Karma will have several completed items during this stage of the game. This will allow it to flatten a lot of damage while peeling for its ports at the same time. Its poke damage will be quite significant during the end of the game, and this ability will increase quite frequently. This means that its DPS will be across the roof, which is very beneficial for its team."}
{"text": "As sett, At level 11, Sett will have two points in its Ultimate R. This will increase its damage production, and its ability to fight against the tanky teams will increase considerably. Its potential of choice is really high during this phase of the game. That's because its E will allow it to put in place brushes of death in the enemy jungle. This will help it to get rid of any non-suspect enemy that happens to pass through this brush. Its presence of team combat is really high. It is mainly due to its W and Ultimate R. It should be able to break the enemies with its true aspect of damage in the bottlenecks."}
{"text": "As akali, Once you have access to all your basic capabilities, you can start trading more efficiently with the enemy. At level 3, you can look for more aggressive coins, but don't engage on them, so you don't fall back. At level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as his Ultimate offers him a lot of pressure to kill extra. Look for killers with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble deals more damage when its bar is more than 50%. Be careful to take trades when it is above this amount. Although, if you can bait its bar and overheat it will lack capacity damage. Once Rumble has its Ultimate b, its death pressure increases. Do not underestimate its all-in-potential with its Ultimate b. If it uses it on you, try to back off as its Jungler could try to gank as its Ultimate b is a good gank configuration. Rumble is strong in team fighting so wait for it to be the grouping and looking for choice with its Ultimate b during the middle and end of the game."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Its Q alone can force the enemy to remember at the base if it continues to be labelled by it. Can move enemy units in its E using its W. This can act as a really good finishing movement against weak enemies, or it can be used to fire an escape when necessary. Is a threat to remember against as a bad reminder can allow it to take the enemy tower very quickly due to its Passive and W."}
{"text": "As swain, Multiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take over fights much easily. His damage output will be pretty phenomenal as well.\n\nHis mid-game presence and fighting style is really great. He can zone off enemies and separate the enemy front line from the backline. He can also pick off-targets.\n\nThe first ability will be maxed at level 9, adding a lot of burst damage to his kit. It helps Swain get rid of squishy targets quickly.        "}
{"text": "Against viktor, Before looking for the all-in-one, bait his d. When Viktor has finished his first upgrade (which is usually his y), make sure you are still outside the wave of the minion so that he is unable to push you and sting at the same time. Extended auto-attack trades work against Viktor in the way. When you play as an AD champion, try to go for extended trades when possible."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce will not be too hard at level 11 because he will not give him as much statistics or utility as the ultimate of most other champions. This will certainly allow him to increase his overall burst damage, however. Once he maximizes his s at level 9, he will be able to flatten a lot of damage. This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of the war and manages to break up an enemy unsuspectingly with his combo w > s. Jayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at the time."}
{"text": "As zac, Try to lure Zac's E before you engage in a fight, because it's his primary mobility tool and he won't be able to get to you without it. Your support in this matchup is extremely strong, so make sure you can go for extended trades in this matchup. Do not do so will seriously undermine your ability to get an early lead. Use your dash with extreme discretion in this matchup otherwise you will give Zac an easy window for all of you. Also, keep trackbrushes monitored, as Zac can use it for all of you out of nowhere. Keep the wave somewhere near your turn in this matchup. It will allow you to easily expose Zac to ganks and keep you completely safe from all of you. That being said, make sure he can't push the wave completely, or you can be diving tour."}
{"text": "Against vex, At level 6, Vex will unlock her Ultimate R. Her kill pressure and pick pressure increase dramatically at this stage of the game.\n\nThe more gold Vex gets under her belt, the stronger she will be. Respect her damage output after she has picked up her first component item.\n\nWhen Vex completes her Mythic item, her wave clear and poke in lane will become devastating. Watch your positioning and stay out of the minion wave."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, His E allows him to CC key targets but has a long cooldown early on. Fortunately, he will not have this problem during the late game and will now take down many enemies with his E.\n\nAdding another point to his Ultimate R will give his empowerments more overall strength. It can be convenient when taking neutral objectives and fighting enemies who rely on diving and locking Heimerdinger down.\n\nHeimerdinger will have many items now, and his abilities can easily one-shot enemies if they are not careful or if Heimerdinger sets a death brush somewhere. He can also take on the Baron singlehandedly."}
{"text": "As ivern, Ivern's level 6 is quite potent as he will now be able to summon Daisy, which can cause many issues for the enemy team. It will also serve as a distraction for neutral objective fights or fights in clumped areas.\n\nIvern's Q range makes him a pretty good early ganker. Once the target gets hit, it will allow both him and his laners to get within auto-attack range of the said target as long as they have vision.\n\nIvern has decent objective control post 6 due to Daisy. He can send Daisy to attack the enemy Jungler and knock them up while he finishes a neutral objective. The opposite can also be done where Ivern can focus on peeling for his allies. At the same time, Daisy keeps hitting the neutral objective."}
{"text": "As sylas, His Ultimate R is completely dependent on the enemy team comp. If the enemy has lacklustre ultimates, Sylas won\u2019t be able to do much.\n\nIf used improperly, his W can get him killed due to him getting displaced to another location. If the enemy purchases Grievous Wounds, they can easily counter this heal by a good amount.\n\nProper vision placement can ruin his chances of being able to flank the enemy team with his E. He won\u2019t be able to effectively impact a fight when he can\u2019t flank the enemy team."}
{"text": "As kayle, A very weak early game causes her to have no form of lane presence. She is an easy gank target at this point, and shutting her down at this point of the game is very easy.\n\nShe is quite prone to CC abilities, especially when her Ultimate R is down to buy her some time for the CC to wear out. Even in fights, she will need to be careful, else she will get chain CC\u2019d and deleted.\n\nAs far as her playstyle is concerned, she will be focused on catching the side waves and not accompanying her team most of the time. This gives the enemy team a huge advantage over her team in terms of numbers and sustenance."}
{"text": "As briar, When you hit level 11, you will have put an extra point in your Ultimate. You will be a more effective ganker and a greater threat at this stage of the game. Of course, you will have maximum your first ability at level 9. Briar is a pretty good champion in the middle of the game. It is important that you abuse your strength during this stage of the game to put you forward."}
{"text": "As malphite, His maxed-out Ultimate h will allow him to pick off enemies frequently. It also becomes a reliable source of picking enemies off due to the short cooldown.\n\nMalphite is really good in late-game team fights due to his ability to disrupt enemies and zone them off. He can also set up multiple combos with his team.\n\nDepending on which build he opts for, he will either be one-shotting the enemy backline or will be able to soak up a lot of damage while front lining for his team."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Level 2 is a massive peak since the Nautilus can now be used by the enemy in a blatant manner and exit the engagement after having suffered no damage in return. Once it reaches level 6, the enemy will have to play very carefully in the game. The enemy cannot get too close to the Nautilus, otherwise it will be killed immediately."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Level 6 is a massive peak for Mordekaiser because it can now use its Ultimate R and 1 v 1 whatever it wants. The first element will allow it to fight more effectively. Its damage will be quite important as well."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen can deal a lot of damage very quickly with a fully stacked Q. Look for trades when you have max stacks.\n\nHer Ultimate R can be recast multiple times. It also offers her a heal which helps her in 1v1 fights.\n\nYour W is a great tool that can stop incoming abilities such as Thresh Q or Blitzcrank b. Although it doesn\u2019t protect your allies, you can put yourself in between you and the enemy so your ally doesn\u2019t get CC\u2019d."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Gwen will be stronger when she has 4 piles on her Passive. Avoid committing to fight when she has maximum piles. When Gwen unlocks her Ultimate R, she will be much stronger and her trading power increases considerably. Extended trades will always work in her favor, especially once she's finished one or two items."}
{"text": "As zac, Having three points in his Ultimate R is a massive powerpike for Xin Zhao. This will allow him to use the ability frequently, giving him a global advantage during the fights. Xin will have two of his capabilities maximized by level 14. It is a significant boost to his duel power, and he will let him dominate 1 v 1's with the greatest ease. During this phase of the game, Xin will be truly tanky while simultaneously inflicting a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that it will be difficult to remove, and still or CC'd mainly carries death if they can't get Xin away from them."}
{"text": "As rengar, Focus on early agriculture. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP. However, if you find an opportunity to sow or counter-gang nearby, don't be afraid to take it. If they invade you early, just back; you don't win early skirmishes with them. Try to secure these major goals when you can, as you have decent objective control."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, Extremely squishy and immobile early on which can make him susceptible to ganks due to how his kit works. This will force him to play defensively, else he will just get camped.\n\nMisuse of his d can cause a lot of issues for him. Junglers will wait for him to have this ability on cooldown before they try to gank him. Locking in improper cards during improper times can cause a lot of issues too.\n\nImproper usage of his Ultimate y can get both him and his team killed, which will ultimately lead to a massive throw. This is due to the fact that Twisted Fate is a macro-based champion, and proper decision making is necessary to play this champion efficiently."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Focus on farming in the early game. You need to earn as much gold as possible to be a major threat later on.\n\nYou\u2019re going to naturally push the minion wave with your Turrets Q. While you\u2019re pushing, keep a constant eye on the map. Heimer is vulnerable to ganks if he doesn\u2019t have 3 Turrets Q up, so keep this in mind.\n\nIf the enemy laner roams, don\u2019t bother trying to contest their roam. Instead, push the minion wave and start earning turret plate gold."}
{"text": "Against taric, Disengage as soon as Taric has activated his Ultimate R so the enemy takes damage. If a target is low though, try to burst them down quickly before the Ultimate R comes into effect. \n\nTaric has surprisingly good engage and catch potential with his E. Watch his positioning at all times so it\u2019s really difficult for him to catch someone out.\n\nInvest in an Executioner\u2019s Calling to reduce the healing of Taric in team fights. "}
{"text": "As nautilus, They will not be able to go into the enemy at all if their ADC constantly pushes the wave in the beginning of the game. Can easily be overturned by various champions in the way. Watching your positioning is the key when you play like this champion. Must commit to all in. If you go, you will be in an extended position that could allow the enemy to turn the exchange and kill you."}
{"text": "Against warwick, Warwick is a strong early game Jungler. Place vision inside the river and at his jungle entrances to reduce his ability to get successful ganks off.\n\nThanks to his kit, Warwick can take objectives pretty quickly and can solo them thanks to the sustain from his Q. Place vision and take the bot side Scuttle Crab to spot him before he is able to take it.\n\nAs Warwick has a strong early game, try to equal his pressure by ganking just as much as him. If you\u2019re not able to gank in the early game, try to invade his jungle and steal away camps when he\u2019s shown on the other side of the map."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus has insane late game damage if he has been able to get tons of stacks with his Q.\n\nIs an easy champion to pick up and understand. His game plan is pretty much the same in each game too. \n\nNasus is a really good split pusher and should be looking to split push and open up the map during the later parts of the game. He can be incredibly hard to stop if he is ahead. While he is drawing pressure, his team can siege or fight elsewhere."}
{"text": "As sylas, Level six is a variable power spike depending heavily on the enemy team's composition. He will have to ensure that he takes the proper ultimates to be effective in the game. \n\nLevel 3 is a decent power spike as it allows him access to all his basic abilities. He will also dish out a lot of damage during duels and heal himself with his W when needed.\n\nThe first item component will bolster his overall damage and will let him take over fights with ease. It will also help him with his Jungle camps and his overall survivability in the game.        "}
{"text": "As nasus, Use your W to slow down the enemy front line and then focus the closest enemy champion in the fight. Push and focus on securing the rounds while your team groups elsewhere on the map. Try to pull the pressure while your team can get something else done on the map. Be ready to group with your team when you are unable to get more goals alone."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Stay with your Support throughout the middle of the game. If you get away from them, you'll be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you're always close to at least 1 ally. Group and stay with your team at all times. Do not divide the thrust or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them. Look for choices with your Support/Jungler to get killed and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As karma, Her poke damage will be a force to reckon with as she can quickly push her laner out of the top lane. She can also set up ganks and provide utility with her d and d.\n\nKarma will be able to max out her Q at level nine. This is terrible news for her enemies as her AoE poke damage will be really obnoxious for the enemy to deal with.\n\nLevel eleven will be a decent power spike due to her ability empowerment potential. This will come in really handy during significant fights in the objective pits."}
{"text": "As rakan, Rakan has great mobility thanks to the items he picks up and his E, W and R. His mobility is increased dramatically when laning with Xayah.\n\nYou have a great Ultimate R that is incredibly impactful in team fights. If you\u2019re able to charm the whole enemy team, you will provide valuable time for your team to deal damage and win the fight.\n\nRakan is a great roaming champion. Look for roaming opportunities once you\u2019ve picked up Boots of Mobility."}
{"text": "As zed, Once he uses his offensive W, he has no other form of escape left to him. This makes him vulnerable to the enemy team's ganks and baits. His ultimate R does no bonus damage to an enemy target if he misses his abilities on them, or if his entire damage is absorbed by a shield. It becomes difficult for him to secure the murders later in the game due to each enemy building defensive objects and peeling for their carryings. Team fighting is not his cup of tea and therefore he must resort to split thrust, leaving the enemy team to a numerical advantage."}
{"text": "As lucian, His first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give him a massive damage boost and will let him take over the mid-game easily.\n\nLucian is excellent during the mid-game as this is the time where he is the most powerful. He can now go to a side lane and split push due to his Passive and basic abilities. This is also why his abilities will hit like a truck, and he will frequently kill enemies.\n\nAt level 11, Lucian will be able to get his stage 2 Ultimate R. It can help him massively during neutral, objective fights and duels due to the amount of damage it dishes out.        "}
{"text": "As ashe, Ashe\u2019s first power spike in lane is once she purchases and upgrade her Boots. The additional ability haste will make her a more potent laner as she can constantly throw out her y on the enemy.\n\nAt level 6, Ashe\u2019s kill pressure in lane increases. Her Ultimate w is very versatile and can set up kills with her team. Make sure you play around your Ultimate w to get kills over and over.\n\nOnce Ashe has picked up her first component item, her trades will be extremely potent. Mix this with a few points in her y and upgraded Boots; her poke will be consistent."}
{"text": "As sett, His W should help him a lot during this phase of the game. The first element will increase his overall ability to fight and survive. His W will hit like a truck now. Level six is a massive power peak because it allows Sett to take an enemy and separate them from the team. He will want to surprise an enemy tanky in the enemy team, although"}
{"text": "As missfortune, Once she has 2 points in her Ultimate e, she will be able to easily handle and disrupt team fighting. Her positioning will be the determining factor from now on. Her first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will greatly increase her damage and allow her one-shot squishes. Miss Fortune excels in team fighting. This is due to her Ultimate e and Passive combined with her kiting potential."}
{"text": "As jinx, It has no form of mobility and can easily be all-in-one once its E is down. Any killing against it puts it back by miles as it is a large-scale ADC, and needs firmness in complete safety. Atrocious early play as it does not damage during this stage and is very vulnerable to all-in. It can easily be zoned out of CS, which is not a good thing for it because it needs its basic items to be useful. Its effectiveness will decrease if it runs away from mana in the track. This is due to the way its Q rockets operate. It will remove its long-range CS capability, which will allow the enemy to zone it easily."}
{"text": "As sylas, Level 6 is a massive peak of power for him, but the power will depend entirely on the composition of the enemy team. He will have to make sure that he takes the ultimate appropriate ones to be effective in the game. The first element will strengthen his overall damage and allow him to resume fighting with ease. He will also help him with his Jungle camps and his overall survival in the game."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, When you sit on a goal, make sure to keep around the target in question to catch Fiddlesticks before he engages with his R. Deny his surprise engages by guiding around your team. Fiddlesticks usually goes to the guard alone during the middle of the game. Try to set up an ambush in a bush and attack him when he will put or refuse the vision around goals like the Baron or Dragon. Do not group closely during the dance with the enemy. As Fiddlesticks can bounce between the players, avoid grouping closely so that he is not able to hit or burst several people down."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Aatrox\u2019s first significant spike is at level 3 when he has access to all his basic abilities. This will allow him to go for favourable trades.\n\nOnce Aatrox gets his first component item, he will be able to go for favourable trades. Look to play more aggressive once you get your first component item.\n\nWhen Aatrox has obtained his Ultimate R; his kill pressure increases dramatically. The extra damage and healing he gets from this ability can help him start a snowball.\n"}
{"text": "As morgana, His Q can be blocked by minions. If the enemy is positioned well throughout the laning phase, it will be very difficult for you to land this ability. Misuse of his E can lead her to many unpleasant situations that are potentially fatal to her. This is especially true if her opponent has a hard form of CC."}
{"text": "Against akshan, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make its all-in less effective. Post 6, try to interrupt or in some way or force Akshan to top its Ultimate. This will increase your survival and it will be put on a short cooldown. Keep in mind that the early armor will be very beneficial in this matchup. Akshan is an AD champion, so picking up the early armor will protect you from some of its damage."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, At level 6, Mordekaiser\u2019s kill pressure increases. Whenever his Ultimate R is up, you need to play more respectfully.\n\nMordekaiser has a strong all-in potential as soon as he hits level 3, but before that he can be poked out of the lane. Abuse him as much as possible before he hits level 3.\n\nTeam fights are where Mordekaiser can shine. If you\u2019re a carry champion, make sure you invest in a QSS so you can get out of his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against volibear, Once Volibear hits level 3, he can look for a favourable trade when all 3 of his basic abilities are up. Expect him to play aggressively at this time.\n\nAt level 6 and whenever he has his Ultimate R up, you need to play more cautiously and avoid committing to fights when you\u2019re low. In particular, recall if you\u2019re low, under tower and when he has his Ultimate R available.\n\nOnce Volibear has completed his first item, his damage output increases a lot. Expect him to play more aggressive and look for kills."}
{"text": "As corki, The wave is approaching early because it will refuse you CS if the wave is pushed too far. Keep in mind its stronger level 6, as it can bring you down and potentially all of it. Stand outside the wave to prevent it from pushing and starting simultaneously. Counter its roaring whenever it has its package to minimize its impact on other ways."}
{"text": "As neeko, Another point in her Ultimate R will allow her to deal massive amounts of damage with her Ultimate R. The cooldown will be reduced as well.\n\nShe will have her core items now, allowing her to deal with a lot of damage. This will help her team during fights, especially choke point fights.\n\nThe first ability will be maxed out at level 9. It will increase her overall burst damage in the game, and she can easily ambush someone.        "}
{"text": "Against braum, During the laning phase, Braum will seek to be a meat shield for his ally using Stand Behind Me W and Unbreakable E to cancel your damage. Try to go for a short trade first to bait and then engage in a trade while he's on cooldown. Make sure there's always 1 minion between you and Braum at any time. This will make it impossible for him to land his Q and potentially stun you. Every time you look for poke or harass Braum, make sure you're not close to his minions so it can't W to them and jump on you and turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo becomes really powerful once it reaches level 16. This means that its Ultimate R will inflict massive amounts of damage in a short period of time. Moreso, the short cooling time will allow Yasuo to deal regularly with tanks. Yasuo will have a pile of articles completed during this phase of the game. This means that Yasuo will decimate the enemy due to its passive damage and r. It can almost a blow of squishies with ease. Thanks to all its completed articles, and its ability to quickly break down and drill through the armors of the tanks, Yasuo will be able to make a plethora of damage in a short period of time. The enemy team could as well at this time if Yasuo manages to advance."}
{"text": "As xerath, Unparalleled poke with his p and 2. His 2 slow makes it much easier for him to be able to land his p and r on his opponents.\n\nHis r is a stun, which can be game changing if it lands on the proper target. It also gives Xerath some form of self peel as he doesn\u2019t want enemy champions on his face.\n\nHis 2 slow can also help him immensely in team fights. He can set-up opportunities for his team to land their crowd control on the 2 slow inflicted member of the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map early will help reduce Xin Zhao\u2019s kill pressure in lane and increase your chances of surviving in bad matchups.\n\nInvesting in healing reduction will help you a ton against Xin Zhao as he tends to have a lot of sustain in lane and throughout the game.\n\nXin Zhao is strong in the early game. Expect him to go for aggressive plays in attempts to get an early lead. \n"}
{"text": "Against gragas, Gragas is an early game support. Expect to play aggressively during levels 1-6. Once Gragas gets his ultimate R, he will be looking for aggressive games once you stretch out. Try to stay as far away from him as possible to make you easier to avoid his R. Keep an eye on what Gragas articles or game style is running. If he builds defensive items, he will be more tankier. If he will damage items, he will crush a lot of damage incredibly quickly."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee has a high skill ceiling which means that if you put a lot of effort into him, you will find a great success with him. His level 6 power peak is very strong and he can easily get murders in his own way, or turn around the map and get murders elsewhere."}
{"text": "As akali, At this stage, your map awareness should be at its peak. You should always try to shove the wave with your Q and try to roam towards any lane which has an extended laner. This will allow you to use your E and Ultimate to catch up to such extended targets, and get rid of them quickly.\n\nWhen you are fighting for a neutral objective and you manage to land an E on an enemy champion, you don't need to always go-in. This is because your presence, and the threat of your E, W, and R which automatically keeps the enemy carries away from you. This will ultimately result in the enemy team being zoned out.\n\nProper usage of your W is very important during this stage of the game. If used freely, the enemy laner can bait you into such an all-in and then get rid of Akali quickly. Also, attempt to stay in a longer lane as it gives you more opportunities to all-in someone."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Focus on getting level three quickly, increasing your clear speed, and gank frequently in the game. Always try overextended gank tracks when possible. You'll want to get your first element quickly as it will give you a boost of massive damage and agree pretty well with your Ultimate R. Once you get your Ultimate R, your duel power will increase. Always try to choose the enemy jungler with that and then take the Dragon or Rift Herald."}
{"text": "As brand, In the late game, Brand will be near full build. This is a significant power spike for Brand as his damage output should be incredibly high. However, he needs to make sure he doesn\u2019t get caught out in the late game or else he will not dish out any damage.\n\nAt level 16, Brand can put the third and final point in his Ultimate R. He will be able to dish out a lot of damage on grouped enemies in late game team fights.\n\nTake note that while you will have a lot of damage, the enemy team should have started building defensive items to counter your abilities. Try to blow up targets that are squishy or who lack defensive stats."}
{"text": "As ivern, The real empowerment potential of Ivern will come to level 9, where he will have his maximum E. He can now peel for his portages with the greatest ease or use the slow of his E to throw an all-in. His Ultimate R will have two points once reached level 11. It will be a great time for him to start the fights, especially those involving the dive in turn and the enemy or to take a neutral goal. Ivern excels in the team fights because he can peel for his portages while making sure that his Ultimate R does all the dirty work for him. He can easily target an enemy and allow his team to collapse on them."}
{"text": "As shen, His tankness knows no limits during this phase of the game. Killing him will prove a test for the enemy team, and he can in the front line for days for his carts. A Ulitmate R maxid-out should allow him to use his Ultimate R quite frequently and increase the amount of shield. He can divide the thrust regularly and always show up to team fighting in time. It is pretty good in late fighting and can change the tide of fighting easily. His E will be quite massive during the objective fighting and piled up, especially if he can get several CC'd enemies with it."}
{"text": "Against milio, Lock him down in team fights. Make sure you hit him with your CC tools so he is unable to use his Ultimate to save his allies.\n\nDon\u2019t fight in the jungle vs Milio because teams will be grouped together and if he is positioned well, he can easily counter your hard engage. It\u2019s better to fight in the open and away from objectives and in tight parts of the map.\n\nGood times to fight him is when he is alone going to ward in the mid and late game. Catching him out means the enemy will be 4v5 and his team will lack peel and utility.\n"}
{"text": "As zeri, Your level 6 all-in will be stronger than hers.\n\nForce her to over extend for farm by keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map early on.\n\nYour goals in this matchup are to really just poke her down and focus on farming.\n\nExtended trades will work in her favour, so just try to focus on farming.\n"}
{"text": "As leblanc, Snowball heavy champion. If Leblanc gets a kill or two, she can snowball the lane and get herself further ahead with ease.\n\nHas a gap closer/ escape ability thanks to her W. This makes her a huge threat in lane and makes her somewhat safe from ganks.\n\nLeblanc has good wave clear thanks to her W. This allows her to match or outpush most laners."}
{"text": "As shaco, A maxed-out Ultimate l will confer the benefits of a lower cooldown and more significant burst damage of the Shaco clone. It will let Shaco one-shot enemies if they destroy it while it is in their vicinity.\n\nHe will be dealing a lot of damage to the enemy team now, especially the squishy targets. He has the potential to one-shot low health, immobile, and squishy targets quickly now.\n\nShaco is pretty decent in team fights due to his clones and the short cooldowns on his abilities. He can quickly get rid of critical carries due to his e and set traps for the enemy team using his Ultimate l and x."}
{"text": "As bard, As long as you have picked up a few meeps before the minions spawn, you will always hit Level 2 before the enemy. Make sure to harass and play aggressive while the enemy is still level 1. Once Bard has picked up Boots, its roaming potential increases considerably. Watch to wander frequently with your E to help your allies around the map. Bard's next power peak is its level 6. Its Ultimate R is versatile enough and can be used to set up games with your Jungler. Make sure to throw the Ultimate R behind the enemy because they can walk in while trying to escape."}
{"text": "Against samira, In the team fights, lock it with CC at the beginning of the fight so that it cannot extinguish the damage. CC will also stop its Ultimate R prematurely, so try to lock it fast if she uses her E. Samira will often be left alone in the average track at the farm during the middle of the game. You could use this as an opportunity to catch her and her Support out of position and force a goal after. Try to force the fights as soon as you spot Samira or when she is on low-style points. Delaying a fight will allow her to get Style points and keep them for the next team fight."}
{"text": "As sion, Make sure that you are present during team fights. This will allow you to peel for your carries and prevent them from dying right at the start of the fight.\n\nYour Ultimate R will allow you to disrupt fights and kill carries with ease. Doing so in chokepoints will easily win you the game.\n\nAlways try to all-in and pick off the enemy Jungler every chance you get. Doing so will allow you to take neutral objectives easily.        "}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is perfect during this stage as team fights frequently occur, which gives her multiple targets to land her abilities on. As a result, she will dish out tons of damage while healing up during a major fight.\n\nGwen will get a massive boost to her fighting power at level 11 due to her Ultimate R now having two points. It is highly beneficial for her team as that ability does a lot of damage and can completely change the tide of a fight.\n\nAt level nine, Gwen will be able to max out her Q. That ability is her paramount damage ability, and it will start dishing out a lot of damage from now. As a result, her enemies will have a hard time dealing with her now."}
{"text": "Against tristana, If Tristana uses her W aggressively, burst her down or CC her so she is unable to reposition and clean up the fight. Taking her down early will make it really difficult for her team to win the fight.\n\nIn the mid-game, if Tristana is ahead, avoid walking too far forward if you\u2019re alone. She has great all-in and pick thanks to her W and E. Keep at an appropriate distance away from her so she cannot easily take you down.\n\nTristana has a lot of self peel with her W and Ultimate R. To make fighting easier, try to play around her Ultimate R or look to flank her in team fights. This will make it harder for her to kite/escape the fight."}
{"text": "As jhin, Take care of its level 6. It has a good gank configuration and take the potential when it unlocks its Ultimate. Let Jhin push towards your side of the map. It is ideal to keep the minion wave here because it lacks a dash and escape tool, so you can get your Jungler to gank and kill it. The best time to fight Jhin is when it is weak on the ammunition. Wait for him to use his fourth shot on a minion, and then try to fight it."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac has great all-in potential throughout the laning phase. As soon as the enemy moves forward or overextends, he can look to play aggressive.\n\nHis Passive and Ultimate R can allow him to singlehandedly take a group of enemies out of a major team fight by simply zoning them away. He can also deal a lot of damage to the enemy backline if they ignore Zac.\n\nZac has good sustain in lane, thanks to his blobs. The additional health and sustain lets him survive harder matchups and out heal the enemy."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Once Ziggs gets Sorcerer, Shows and Ludens, he erases minion waves incredibly quickly. Don't leave him in an unattended lane for too long that he can kill a lap in much less than a minute. Zigg's death threat increases to level 6 because his Ultimate R deals a constant amount of damage if he uses it nearby. Don't let him get you down the track as he will use it to finish you. Ziggs is pretty good in the middle of the game and team fights if he is allowed to delay a team fight and fight with his Q. You can prevent this peak of power by not allowing him to get down and delay a team fight."}
{"text": "As kalista, Kalista's level 11 doesn't give her a significant spike but is a boon for her Oathbound ally. Her ability to protect them from botched all-ins or make them initiate all-ins for the team increases a thousand folds.\n\nAt level 9, she should have her first ability maxed out. Most of the time, it will be her r, which will give her a massive damage boost and will allow her to take objectives flawlessly.\n\nKalista is outstanding during the mid-game. This is mainly because she can dish out a lot of damage with her auto-attacks and Passive while her team peels for her. Her Ultimate x helps her set-up engages as well.        "}
{"text": "As malphite, Don't fight in the late game unless your Ultimate h is up. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available as you're going to miss out on the knockup potential it provides. Your Ultimate h will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or out of position. Peel for your efforts to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As riven, After going in with your Ultimate e, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate e in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate e is up. Fighting with out it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Caitlyn would have completed several elements in the middle of the game. It's good for her because her damage release will be quite high. However, while she does a lot of damage, her survival in the middle of the game is incredibly poor. At level 9, Caitlyn is going to max her Q. She should be able to clear the waves quite quickly at this stage of the game thanks to the damage he provides and the elements she will have at this stage of the game. She should be good at removing early spins. At level 11, Caitlyn, Ultimate R will be useful as she can execute higher health goals. However, her Ultimate R leaves her incredibly vulnerable which means that she can't use it in the middle of a battle like the other ADCs."}
{"text": "As singed, Extremely vulnerable to crowd control, which can also ruin his chances of farming by proxy of the way. It is also useless if his team can't really capitalize on him attracting all the attention. He suffers in the early game that he can't use his l regularly. Once he is out of mana, he can't do anything and is practically useless. Should really participate in team fights until he has his Ultimate n up. Otherwise, he can easily be amazed and removed from the fight. He certainly needs his tank stats to dive into the enemy team."}
{"text": "As milio, When you reach level 9, you\u2019ll max out your first ability which is important for you in the laning phase.\n\nAt level 11 you\u2019ll put your second point in your Ultimate. It will leave your Ultimate on a shorter cooldown and you\u2019ll be stronger overall.\n\nAt level 13, you\u2019ll max your next ability. As teams will be grouping at this stage of the game, you will be extremely useful with level 13 under your belt.\n"}
{"text": "As teemo, Its passive can be really heinous to manage, especially when it hides in a brush and moves in and out while peeling its laner with its ts and ts. It is the jerk of the ADC sector as its t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the efficiency of the portage for a while, which gives its team some time to engage/disengage freely. The Ultimate t can act as a substitution to the vision, as well as do a lot of damage when it is kept in the right places."}
{"text": "Against rell, At level 1, make sure to harass and poke Rell with basic attacks to get her health low before she reaches level 2. Gain an early health advantage so she is unable to engage. \n\nWhen Rell hits level 6, her Ultimate R can be used in a variety of ways. Do not commit to fights near her tower as she could look to play aggressive and get a kill.\n\nWhen Rell gets Mobi Boots, she may look to roam around the map and impact her allies lanes. Communication is key and you need to communicate with your teammates when she is gone."}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Try to gain an early advantage by playing aggressively and blowing an early Flash. Kassadin is at his weakest during the laning phase and is very abuseable. Position level 6, if you have CC capabilities, do not use them unless his Ultimate k is down as he will use their cooldowns to play aggressive and trade with you. Kassadin lacks clear vague in the early game. If you can keep the wave closer to your side of the card early, it will be very difficult for him to close or break your freeze. If he walks until the last shot, you can look at trading with him."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo becomes really powerful once it reaches level 16. This means that its Ultimate R will inflict massive amounts of damage in a short period of time. Moreso, the short cooling period will allow Yasuo to deal regularly with tanks. Yasuo will have a pile of articles completed during this phase of the game. This means that Yasuo will decimate the enemy due to its passive damage and r. It can pretty much a squishie blow with ease. Due to all its completed articles, and its ability to quickly jump around and drill through the armor of the tanks, Yasuo will be able to make a plethora of damage in a short time. The enemy team could as well at this time if Yasuo manages to advance."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of mana problems in the beginning of the game, but once she gets Tear of the Goddess, she will play a lot more aggressive. Cassiopeia really shines in the end of the game. She swings better than most champions and she can build 6 items. If you get early- Try to close the game as soon as possible. Not many champions are as strong as Cassiopeia is at level 2. Beware of Level 2 all of it with her Q and E spam."}
{"text": "As twitch, If Twitch invades you early, think twice before fighting it. You should fight it only if you can close the gap between you and him, or otherwise it will just kite you. Just focus on agriculture early. You need as much gold and XP as possible to get into the game. Place the vision and buy control pupils to help your team spot Twitch before it is able to spoil and get killed."}
{"text": "As kayle, A monster of the end of the game because of its passive functioning. If it can go through the laning phase and can acquire CS in an orderly manner, it will easily take the game later. Its Ultimate R can allow it to save a teammate as well as herself depending on the situation. If it is behind it, it can easily use it on a murderer in its team so that it can keep the enemy distracted from its presence. The Q and W allows it to catch up with ease and get rid of them once it is powerful enough."}
{"text": "As vex, Always watch your positioning at level 6. Her level 6 is stronger so she can easily kill you if she lands her 6.\n\nPost 6, focus on ushing and matching her wave clear. This will reduce her chances of pushing you into your tower and gaining a gold lead.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave at all times. This will make it harder for her to push and poke you at the same time.\n\nTry to stay at max range and poke her from afar. Apart from her Q and Ultimate, her Q and R are not very high, so she will be unable to hit you with them."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Very immobile and hence is vulnerable to layered crowd control. He can\u2019t push up freely unless he already knows where the enemy Jungler is, otherwise, he will just be killed.\n\nHis E is his only source of self-peel. Misusing it makes him way more vulnerable to all-ins and can probably get him killed almost instantly if the enemy laner has some form of blink or ranged crowd control ability.\n\nHis Ultimate R roots him in place, making it very easy for enemy champions with ranged crowd control to interrupt his Ultimate R and get on top of him along with their team."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee has a high skill ceiling which means that if you put a lot of effort into him, you will find a great success with him. His level 6 power peak is very strong and he can easily get murders in his own way, or turn around the map and get murders elsewhere."}
{"text": "As samira, Samira's game is quite strong. It can shoot down enemies with its Q while being extraordinarily mobile and escaping crucial skillsshots with its W. It will be difficult to catch it. Level six is a huge power peak as it allows Samira to impact and disrupt the battles massively. It is also a decent finishing movement, especially in the lit fighting. Its first element will increase its potential duel significantly. Its ability to reduce damage in the track will also skyrocket."}
{"text": "As lulu, This champion is pretty immobile and is prone to CC. If they get caught out by any CC, they will probably die.\n\nHas less carry potential compared to a lot of other Supports. Lulu relies on her team to carry while she provides them with heals and shields.\n\nLulu is a squishy champion with low hit points. This makes her pretty vulnerable and easy to kill. Picking your fights and avoiding constant trading is key to winning."}
{"text": "As neeko, Extremely useful in team fighting due to its Ultimate R CC and damage. This allows her team to play around her and her Jungler for gank her. She has tons of poke in the track and can easily intimidate the enemy with her Q and E. Her Ultimate R is incredibly powerful for a Support."}
{"text": "Against fiora, Fiora is a great split pusher and one of the best duelists in the game thanks to her Ultimate R and Q. If you can't match her in a side lane, try your best to force an uneven team fight on the other side of the map.\n \nFiora relies heavily on life steal. Buy a grievous wounds item early to neuter a huge part of what makes her such a good duelist.\n \nKeep a constant eye on the map and the location of Fiora when you\u2019re grouped with your team. If she goes missing, expect that she\u2019s coming to join the team fight. If she stays in a side lane, don\u2019t let her destroy your base while you try and fight. "}
{"text": "Against lucian, In team fights, take care that Lucian can use his E to reposition and escape danger. Try and wait for him to use his  E before using your CC abilities so it\u2019s harder for him to dodge them. \n\nAvoid letting Lucian get a full channel of his Ultimate R on you in a team fight by disengaging or cancelling it with CC. \n\nLookout for Lucian\u2019s positioning. He will often walk forward in order to land auto attacks. Once he has mispositioned, use this to your advantage to focus him down."}
{"text": "As karma, Poke the enemy as much as possible with your Q to get them low. Use your early lane dominance to gain a health advantage over the enemy.\n\nWatch your positioning at all times. Karma is super squishy and will easily die if she walks too far forward.\n\nMake sure you place vision around your lane to keep you and your ADC safe. Staying alive is key to winning in the later parts of the game."}
{"text": "As syndra, Its R, E combo can CC an entire enemy team if they are grouped. This can also be used to select high priority targets. Its E is a multipotent capacity that can keep it safe even when it pushes upwards. With a good guard and this ability, it is quite safe in the track."}
{"text": "Against trundle, When Trundle activates his n, backs off immediately. He will become much more tankier and your tanks will be weak. Re-engagement when his Subjugate Subjugate n has cooled. He has great potential of choice in the middle of the match with his e. Avoid standing too far ahead that he can push you towards his team and then all of you. Poke is your best friend against Trundle."}
{"text": "As karma, Once your bottom lane rotates to the mid lane, go to a side lane and start to farm. Try not to fall behind in gold and XP by sharing it with your ADC and Support.\n\nIn team fights, use your empowered d to provide a large shield to your allies. Unless you need to use your d or Q, you should try to use your d to help them survive.\n\nDelay team fights for as long as possible in the mid game while you poke and harass the enemy with your Q."}
{"text": "Against zilean, Zilean is super squishy. Focus him rather than the ADC enemy in the way to increase your chances of getting killed. Once Zilean is level 6, it will be harder for you to get killed in the way. Every time his Ultimate t is down, try to abuse him to get killed. One way to kill him when his Ultimate t is up is to lock him up with CC so he is unable to use it on himself."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia is one of the most immobile champions of the game. Cassiopeia is therefore a target of choice for the ganks and teams with good diving potential. When against mobile champions like Talon, Lee Sin, Rengar, it will be really difficult for her to land her Q, make use of her W and escape a trade. She fights against enemies who move quickly."}
{"text": "As vayne, Her first ability will be maxed out at level nine. From this point, she will start hitting like a truck as her e will be up very quickly in the game. This and her n will make it impossible for a single enemy top laner to catch her.\n\nGetting two points in her Ultimate n will cause her to spike again. It will help her a lot in team fights, especially when the enemy team is filled with heavy CC champions.\n\nShe will have her core items by now, which means that she will deal a respectable amount of damage. She can even duel enemies if she masters her e usage.        "}
{"text": "As neeko, Your W and Passive should allow you to get easy choices on enemies who are too pushed up in the way. Your Ultimate R will be pivotal for team fights. Just make sure you use your Passive to hide and your Ultimate R liquidation time. The take of enemies will be the name of the game during this phase. Work with your Jungler and see if you can blow up a bit of Jungler wandering or Support from the enemy team."}
{"text": "As kennen, Group with your team and do not leave them. If you start to split push, the enemy will force a fight and kill your team while you\u2019re gone.\n\nDelay team fights while you wait for your Ultimate m to come back up. Do not team fight unless your Ultimate m is up. Additionally, waiting for your Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass to come up would be beneficial too.\n\nIf the enemy has lots of disengage or poke, continue to flank in team fights to ensure you get on to the enemy before they\u2019re able to disengage or poke you down."}
{"text": "Against jax, If you encounter him in a 1v1, avoid fighting him when his Ultimate t is in place. Once Jax gets his first element, it becomes much more difficult duel unless you have elements that match his damage. Do not commit yourself to fighting him without a backup plan. As the game unfolds, Jax will become stronger and stronger. Keep an eye on him at any time he will seek to divide the thrust and take goals quickly."}
{"text": "As ahri, Keep farming up till you get to the full build. Once that is done (or while farming), you may use the minion wave as bait and set up death brushes around it. It will allow you to catch enemies unaware with your E and burst them down before they can react.\n\nTeam fighting should be similar to the mid-game. Always look for ways to flank the enemy and take out one or two squishy members of their backline. This will also act as a signal for your team to engage, and if they don't engage, you can always use your last Ultimate charge to get out.\n\nThe fog of war is your friend and you should use this to set up death brushes with your team. This works especially well when a major fight is going to take place for a neutral objective like the Baron. Also, try to take fights in closed areas like the Jungle, as it will let you hit multiple people with your Q. "}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Avoid grouping too close together otherwise, Lissandra will be able to engage with her E and land a multi-person W.  If you can, try to split up slightly so she can only hit 1 or 2 champions at the most.\n\nPlay around Lissandra\u2019s Ultimate R cooldown. Once it\u2019s on cooldown, she is rather vulnerable and cannot team fight properly. You can use this to your advantage to force team fights when you know it\u2019s hard for her to fight.\n\nLissandra has tons of wave clear, so sieging objectives in the mid and late game is going to be tricky. Keep this in mind and try to take her down or poke her out of lane so she cannot defend her Turrets."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Kayle is really weak in the early game. Try to abuse her as much as possible so she is forced to back early and delay her first major power spike.\n\nOnce Kayle hits level 6, she will become ranged and get a lot of added protection thanks to her Ultimate R. You need to always consider her Ultimate R when trying to fight her post level 6.\n\nAs Kayle becomes stronger as the game goes along, you really need to end the game as quickly as possible. If you cannot end the game and it gets to late game, you are gonna find it difficult to win."}
{"text": "As fizz, When Fizz puts a second point in his Ultimate R at level 11, it will be incredibly scary to play against it because his Ultimate R will be on a cooldown low and inflict a lot of damage. Fizz will maximize his first ability at level 9. His death pressure and escarment power will be quite high level 9. Thanks to his cooldowns and the general state of the game, during the middle of the game, he will be able to assassinate and get choices on weak-health enemies as they walk around Rift Summoners alone."}
{"text": "As veigar, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. Now, he can do about a quarter of the health bar of a squishy target with his e. At level 11, he will have two points in his ultimate R. This will massively amplify his damage, and Veigar will easily be able to shoot enemies and squishy tanks at once. Veigar will now have several piles, which will grant him a lot of free power. This is terrible news for the enemy team because Veigar will soon be unstoppable."}
{"text": "As neeko, During the laning phase, it\u2019s really easy for you to steal your ADC\u2019s farm by mistake. \n\nVery squishy and can easily get blown up by the enemy once she is locked down.\n\nCan\u2019t be very effective if the enemy sets proper vision around and can notice Neeko changing forms or hiding in a brush to land her E."}
{"text": "As sylas, You are way stronger than Sylas early. Invade him and try to fight him in the 1v1.\n\nMake sure you apply as much pressure as possible by ganking often in the early game.\n\nRemember to take those objectives. Unlike Sylas, you can solo those objectives quite easily.\n\nIf you see Sylas ganking nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to counter gank. You\u2019re a really strong counter-ganker!\n"}
{"text": "As teemo, His Passive can be really obnoxious to deal with, especially when he is hiding in a brush and moving in and out while pelting his laner with his t and t.\n\nHe is the bane of ADC mains as his t quite literally makes them miss their auto-attacks. This can reduce the effectiveness of the carry for a while, which gives his team some time to engage/disengage freely.\n\nThe Ultimate t can act as a substitution for vision, as well as deal a lot of damage when kept in the right spots. This is especially useful when it comes to avoiding ganks."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Aatrox is a lane bully who can snowball quite quickly. If you\u2019re able to get an early lead, try to abuse it to get more kills in lane to increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nYou\u2019re a very mobile champion thanks to your E. It can be used in multiple ways and is a good way of turning around exchanges with the enemy.\n\nYou have tons of sustain thanks to your Passive and Ultimate. This will increase your survivability in team fights and skirmishes."}
{"text": "Against jhin, If he has a commitment support, his level 2 will be very strong as he can use his W to CC chain with the help of his support. When Jhin gets 100% write damage, his trading power will increase considerably. Always keep an eye on the articles he currently has and avoid fighting him alone if his articles are better than yours."}
{"text": "Against aurelionsol, Aurelion is quite vulnerable to ganks since he has to push the wave. But, he can use his W to escape one. Make sure you do not waste your gap closer if he has his W or Ultimate  available so you can catch up to him if he tries to escape.\n\nWhen Aurelion Sol pushes and roams, make sure you ping as soon as he goes missing. Try to push the wave back and start taking Tower plates if you\u2019re unable to match his roam.\n\nTry and abuse Aurelion Sol\u2019s Q cooldown. Once it\u2019s down, he is very vulnerable. Look for favourable trades whenever he misses it."}
{"text": "As elise, Peel for your team in team fights. Keeping them alive and using your E to protect and keep them alive is important.

Once he activates it, try to either reposition, disengage or lock him down with CC so he is unable to land every bullet on you.\n\nWhenever Lucian\u2019s E is up, he will be stronger as he can dodge skill shots and CC.

{"text": "As khazix, Is quite versatile with his playstyle due to how his Ultimate R works. His Q allows him to both secure objectives quickly, as well as get kills on isolated targets with ease.\n\nHis evolved E and Ultimate R lets him perform multiple outplays and escapes in situations where any other champion would probably get killed. The takedown reset is an added bonus to this ability and can be used to secure multiple kills in a short span of time.\n\nThe isolation part of his kit allows him to 1 v 1 any champion who is side laning alone. This is especially true when it comes to dealing with squishy carry champions who are trying to catch a side wave."}
{"text": "As katarina, Try to abuse your range advantage to gain an early health lead.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early on to force them to over extend for farm and XP.\n\nWhen trying to poke, aim your abilities so they hit the minion wave and the enemy at the same time.\n\nOnce they\u2019re level 6 they become stronger than you and it will be harder for you to lane against them.\n"}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Try not to group too closely as it will allow Vladimir to get a good Ultimate e off. By splitting up slightly, Vladimir will have to use his Ultimate e on fewer targets. \n\nExpect Vladimir to flank from the side in team fights.

{"text": "As irelia, At level 9, Irelia will be able to maximize her Q. Being her central damage ability, she will be able to surpass her enemies for days now. The maintenance will be pretty decent too. Once she manages to get an extra point in her Ultimate R, she will use the ability frequently in the way. This will allow her to take more skirmishes and win most duels in the game. Irelia is excellent at the skirmishes due to her mobility, the reduction of damage, and Ultimate R. Fighting in bottlenecks and objective pits will surely bring her forward in the game."}
{"text": "As pantheon, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nYour level 6 is far superior to theirs.

Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As chogath, Try to take fights around choking points. This will allow you to use your e really easily and increase your overall efficiency during the game. You might have to adjust your gameplay according to your lead in the game. If you're too far ahead, focus on building damage, otherwise focus on saving your teammates. Be a part of as many neutral goal fights as you can in this phase of the game. This will really help you get more goals due to how your Ultimate t works."}
{"text": "Against milio, His first major power peak is at level 6. This can be a blessing for many matchups if he stands up against hard committed champions because he can prevent his ADC from getting killed. The next major peak is when he finished his first element because he increases his coat, damage and overall makes him stronger. When he maximizes his Q at level 9, he will be much stronger and his poke will be more powerful."}
{"text": "As malphite, This is a tank versus tank matchup. Your best bet is to just avoid them and focus on farming early.\n\nHowever, they are a stronger ganker than you in the early game, so be prepared to counter-gank and track them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get a lead from easy ganks, try to invade their jungle and steal away their camps.\n\nPost 6, look to make plays and gank your allies whenever your Ultimate is up.

{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim's h will be maximized once it reaches level 9, which will allow it to eliminate a lot of constant damage when it is in the middle of the enemy team.

This means that it can use it frequently, which translates into deader enemies wears."}
{"text": "Against samira, Whenever Samira has max style points, she will be able to use her Ultimate R. Avoid trading with her when she has max points. At level 6, Samiras kills pressure increases as long as she has max style points. Be careful that she can look for an all-in when she is at point A. Samira is at her weakest when she is out of mana or out of style points."}
{"text": "Against lux, Always make sure that you are standing behind at least 2 minions so that she is unable to root you with her g. If Lux uses her g and missing it, use the cooldown of this aggressive ability to play because she will not be able to protect herself and prevent the effectiveness of all-in. Mitigate Lux=l standing behind and not inside the wave minion. This will make her choose between using her l for poke with or to push with."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "Against zac, Zac really has long periods of cooling on his engagement abilities. Therefore, he can really use them as a tool of engagement or escape only once in a fight. If you know that he is without these abilities- try to fight him. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the pre-6 card. This will make it harder to jump with his E and should increase your overall survival in the way. Zac has really good roaming potential."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, level 3 is a decent powerspike as Heimerdinger will have access to all his abilities. He can easily CC immobile ADC and burst them down with his turrets and rockets. His E will be very beneficial when going for objective fights.\n\nLevel 6 is arguably a colossal power spike for Heimerdinger, as he can now bait enemies to their deaths with ease. He can also take towers very quickly or slow multiple enemies with his E.\n\nThe first mythic item will allow Heimerdinger to dish out a ton of poke damage in the lane with his turrets. His burst damage will be pretty potent as well, and he can one-shot enemies with utmost ease."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Teams tend to group up during the late game. This means that Lissandra will have a gala time finding picks and CC'ing the entire enemy team.\n\nHer Ultimate R will become really powerful when it is maxed out. This means that she will be able to pick off enemies with ease and whenever she wants to. This is really beneficial for her team.\n\nLissandra will have multiple items during this phase of the game. This means that she will be dealing tremendous amounts of AoE damage which will be detrimental to the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against kindred, Once Kindred reaches level 6, it will be much stronger as it can use its Ultimate R to go for more unorthodox ganks.

According to its construction path, Cho=Gath will either do a lot of damage in late game fights or be incredibly tanky."}
{"text": "Against jax, If Jax decides to fight as a team, try to lock him up with CC before he has the chance to engage. While his e will block the basic attacks, he is vulnerable to disengagement and CC. Jax will seek to divide the thrust in the last stages of the game. Always keep an eye on where he is at a given time. Do not let him take goals and open your base for free."}
{"text": "As zac, His boots will give him a massive powerspike as it allows him to roam easily, and he can rotate between lanes easily. It can also allow him to set traps for the enemy by recalling early and walking back to the lane faster than his enemies.\n\nlevel 2 and level 3 are significant power spikes as it allows Zac to bolster his all-in potential. Both levels add a layer to his all-in and CC, which will enable his ADC to follow up on all-ins with ease.\n\nlevel 6 is another major powerspike as it can allow Zac to affect team fights massively. It will make neutral objective fights way easier for him."}
{"text": "Against graves, Once Graves gets his first element, his death pressure will increase. Expects that he will play more aggressive once he has some levels and element components behind him. At level 6, Graves will have access to his Ultimate t. Once he has his Ultimate t available, his death pressure increases considerably."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Invade Fiddle in the early game to refuse him as much gold as you can. It is low before level 6 but even weaker before level 3 in order to use this to your advantage. When Fiddlesticks reaches level 6 he will try to surprise you gank with his R. Keep track of where Fiddlesticks is and inform your team, so that they can get pupils down and play safely when it's on their side of the card. Before engaging on Fiddlesticks, ask yourself if it's the real one. Don't waste everything on a fake scarecrow."}
{"text": "As nocturne, When no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got a pick with your Ultimate a, make the call for Baron or Drake. You need to exploit that the enemy is missing a key player."}
{"text": "Against skarner, Skarner will look to flank in team fights with his E. Ward the flanks to make it easier for you to escape him before he comes charging at you.\n\nAvoid fighting in the jungle, around objectives or near the Baron. You need to be spaced out so he cannot land his Ultimate on multiple champions at once.\n\nInvest in armor and magic penetration items. Skarner will be building tank items and you will be unable to kill him if you do not buy these items.\n"}
{"text": "As malphite, Make sure you put good emphasis on taking Dragons for your team. After ganking the bottom lane and rotating immediately, you can take the first Dragon.\n\nYour Ultimate is strong, so you must abuse it to gain a lead over Malphite. They will be ganking often, so you need to do so too.\n\nAs you\u2019re great at duelling and strong early on, try to make early plays around the map to get yourself and your allies ahead.\n\nAs Malphite is so weak early, just go into their jungle and try to fight them or force them to recall. Setting them behind will delay their power spike.\n"}
{"text": "Against sona, Once Sona reaches level 6, her death pressure increases and she can start playing more aggressively. In addition, her Ultimate R offers her additional gank configuration, so expect her Jungler gank post 6. Her healing of her W will be a problem as the game unfolds. Make sure your team invests in Execution."}
{"text": "As irelia, Irelia is extremely strong when her Passive is stacked up. This is when she should be going for a significant fight as it will ensure a massive victory for her as long as she has a target to auto-attack. Bonus points to survivability if she can Q to minions and reset the ability.\n\nThe first item component will help Irelia massively in this lane. It will bolster her dueling potential and increase her survivability. It will be highly beneficial when her Passive is stacked up completely.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant power spike where Irelia can start dictating the pace of this lane. Her opponent will have to be very careful as Irelia can decimate them with her Ultimate R and Q should they get hit by the initial Ultimate R cast."}
{"text": "As sylas, Level 6 is a variable power peak highly dependent on the composition of the enemy team. It will have to make sure that it takes the ultimate appropriate ones to be effective in the game. Level 3 is a decent power peak as it allows it to access all its basic capabilities. It will also dry up a lot of damage during the duels and heal with its W when necessary."}
{"text": "As veigar, Veigar is relatively weak during the early game, and he should be focusing on trying to e and stack up his Passive when possible. His n will come in handy when trying to prevent all-ins.\n\nPost-six, he will have access to all his basic abilities. This is huge for him as he can now CC enemies and then combo them with his r and e when possible.\n\nLevel six is a significant power spike as it gives him access to his finishing ability. Now he will just have to focus on poking the enemy out in the lane before decimating them with his Ultimate R.        "}
{"text": "As evelynn, Evelynn is weak at the beginning of the game. Keep this in mind and focus on agriculture so you can hit your first major power peak. At level 6, Evelynn will reach its first power peak. Unlocking its Ultimate R is very important and it can start to glove once it unlocks it. The first Mythic element for Evelynn is very important."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Evelynn will be much stronger at this stage of the game. Eve is very good in the middle of the game as the enemies will walk on the card themselves. As Evelynn is a murderer, if she can get spikes on isolated targets, she can get a huge lead. At level 11, Evelynns Ultimate R will do more damage and she will be incredibly strong at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As shen, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Stay with your team at the end of the game. Don't separate or stay away from them; otherwise, the enemy can try to take you or launch a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus on the only rear line, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas succeeds in reaching level 11, it will have two points in its Ultimate R. This means that it can initiate fighting and move key enemy targets much more frequently. At level 9, Gragas will have its first maximum ability. This is really beneficial for it because the increase in damage will really help it to duel. This is especially true if Gragas goes for full AP construction. During the middle of the game, the enemy will be busy exchanging tracks and defining the vision. However, as laner, it will use this ability to the maximum potential during the fight around landlocked areas and neutral objectives."}
{"text": "Against ashe, Don't let Ashe push you under your lap early. If you're pushed under your turn, your ADC will find it difficult to grow because of her poke. Once Ashe has her Ultimate w does not stretch out because she can easily install her Jungler with it. Keep track watch at all times as this is the only time when it will be safe for you to expand post 6. To prevent Ashe from getting extra damage on you in the game early, stand behind the minion wave at any time so they block its Volley damage there for you."}
{"text": "Against draven, You need to be very respectful against Draven as he can dish out tons of damage if he gets a few kills in the laning phase. Keep an eye out for his itemisation as the game develops and play accordingly.\n \nDraven is hard to play in team fights as he has to control his Axes g. In team fights, try to lock him down with CC to make it really hard for him to pick up his Axes g and dish out damage.\n \nTry to kill Draven whenever his stacks of Adoration is high. It will deny him from getting a huge influx of gold after gaining a kill. "}
{"text": "As briar, Your Ultimate is extremely strong. It is crucial that you\u2019re proactive with your Ultimate and gank whenever your Ultimate is up as she will be doing the exact same.\n\nShe is stronger than you post 6. Keep your distance and run away if you find her alone.\n\nMake sure you secure those Dragons so you can keep your team in the game!\n\nCounter ganking Briar is really easy on this champion. Don\u2019t be afraid to counter gank her.\n"}
{"text": "As hwei, Keep placing vision and guard for your teammates. Avoid guarding alone, otherwise you will die. Your squisty body makes you very vulnerable in the end of the game. Stay with your team at all times. Don't leave their side, as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Look for choices with your team. Use your E and Ultimate to spot choices and remove enemies that have spread too much without assistance."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Can deal heavy amounts of burst damage in a very short time, which gives the enemy very little time to react. One such C E Q combo can ruin the enemy laners life.\n\nHer Ultimate R allows her to traverse a long distance almost immediately and can provide a lot of utility in choke points. This will also give her traction to easily land her C.\n\nHer E is really effective against enemies who have some form of dash. She can thus make life a living hell for laners who rely a lot on dashes."}
{"text": "As olaf, The second point in its Ultimate k will give it another peak. It can run enemies frequently now that the cooldown of the ability will be reduced. Olaf will have its basic elements during this phase of the game. It will increase its damage and survivals in the game, which will make it really good during the middle of the game. Its overall damage will be really high during this phase of the game. Its tankness and Passive will make sure that it kills enemies with ease, especially those taken out of position."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Once Pyke has got Serrated Dirk, he will try to push constantly and roam. Keep this in mind when laning against him.\n\nWhen Pyke hits level 6, his kill pressure increases as his Ultimate R is an execute. Back away when low so he is unable to kill you and snowball his lead.\n\nPyke is really good at roaming. Once he has Mobi Boots, expect him to roam around the map and assist his allies. Ping whenever he goes missing."}
{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze is at his weakest during the early game. Try to abuse this by looking for an early all-in to force him to recall.\n\nRyze doesn\u2019t spike at level 6 as his Ultimate R is a utility tool. Use this to your advantage to win a level 6 all-in.\n\nYou should try to end the game as quickly as you can as Ryze becomes stronger and stronger as the game goes along. Shutting him down in the early game or ending it quickly will make it harder for him to carry in the late game."}
{"text": "Against trundle, It can easily kill you at level 2 with its Pillar e. Do not walk too far forward. Investing in the reduction of healing will make the treatment with Trundle=\"s support much easier in this matchup. Stand in the middle of the track rather on the sides of the track. If you are standing around the edges near the wall, allow it to set up its Jungler with a quick and easy Pillar e."}
{"text": "Against zac, Zac has really long cooldowns on his engage abilities. Because of this, he can only really use them as an engage or escape tool once per fight. If you know he is without these abilities- try to fight him.\n\nPlacing vision around his jungle entrances and in the river will reduce his ability to get successful ganks off. Take note that Zac can gank from afar with his E though.\n\nThe easiest way for Zac to kill the Scuttle Crab is by using his E . If you see him killing the Scuttle Crab, it will usually mean that his E  is on cooldown and he\u2019ll lack an escape tool."}
{"text": "As taric, Your work will be just like a support during this phase of the game. Stay close to your carriers and participate in every team fight that happens on the map. Using your Ultimate R during neutral objective fights will be the difference between a win and a defeat. A good time to use it will be before a Major Smit fight. During team fights, make sure you stay with your backline at all times. The only time you can go forward is when you try to use your E."}
{"text": "As zoe, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in the way. You have a lot of poke, so try poke the enemy down as often as you can. Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your Q. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}
{"text": "Against naafiri, She is very good at roaming and ganking, so make sure to contact your team so they know when she's missing. Place the vision in her jungle entrances and the river. In the middle of the game, she will seek to remove targets that walk around the map alone. Avoid crossing the river if she's not monitored. Playing around her Packmates in the middle of the game and during team fights will be extremely beneficial as she will lack damage."}
{"text": "Against shaco, Shaco has good control of the Dragon in the early game. Be sure to keep it guarded at all times so that you can spot it before it takes it. Its duelling power is pretty good in the early game. Think twice before fighting it especially if you are spotted as it can place a box x behind it and use try to chase it down. As a laner, keep the bushes straight out of the earned way."}
{"text": "As lucian, Avoid all the ins on Lucian during the early game as it is safe to decimate you in this matchup. Also, during the laning, make sure that you are not attuned with minions. Remember that Lucian can counter your mobility easily. That being said, you have 2 dashes, so use it well. It falls as the game continues, and you do it. Be careful, and try to finish the game of 30 minutes other you will have a lot of trouble. Keep the wave near your turn and see if you can expose it to the ganks."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Can\u2019t gank very effectively until she gets her level six. She will be heavily reliant on the enemy team pushing up and will thus spend most of the time power farming.\n\nControl Wards are her mortal enemies. If the enemy team invests a lot in them and places them in key spots, it will become very hard for Evelynn to pull off successful ganks.\n\nShe will have to be really careful while she is ganking someone when her Ultimate R is on cooldown. This is very important when she is ganking someone who has a lot of CC in their kit."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Don't regroup closely in an objective fight or team because it gives Gragas the opportunity to hit your entire team with his Ultimate R. In a fight, make sure you're not too forward or get away from your team. If you're too forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught like this could lead the enemy to take a goal soon after. Constantly try poke and harass Gragas. Having him in bad health will prevent him from playing or aggressively positioning himself."}
{"text": "Against akshan, He could drive your team in danger or an ambush. Try to look for fights when Akshan is not there. This way, he won't be able to benefit from his W. Playing around Akshans Ultimate will be very beneficial during the middle of the game. Otherwise, he will be unable to maximize his release of damage."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is really good during the late game. His abilities will hit like a truck due to his items. His Ultimate e will be pivotal to winning the game.\n\nOnce he gets 3 points in his Ultimate e, it will allow him to half-health squishy enemies easily. This means that anyone who is behind on the enemy team will suffer a lot.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Karthus would've maxed his 1 and his e. His damage output in team fights will be very high."}
{"text": "As jhin, Once Jhin gets two points in his Ultimate R, he secures the shots with ease and helps his team catch up with the enemies. Damage will also be increased. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to clear the minion waves with ease, and the damage inflicted on the champions will be really high. Jhin's damage capacity will be really high during the middle of the game. He can blow the squishes with his abilities and 4th shot. He will just have to make sure that he can kite around the tanks."}
{"text": "As ahri, Ahri\u2019s Passive offers her extra sustain in lane which can help her survive even the toughest of matchups. While the healing isn\u2019t much, it can be impactful.\n\nThanks to Ahri\u2019s E, she has great pick potential throughout all stages of the game. When used in conjunction with her R, she will be able to catch enemies out of position and increase her gold lead.\n\nIn team fights, your mobility is quite formidable. With your Ultimate, you\u2019re able to flank the enemy from the side, get a kill and then escape before anyone is able to catch you. \n"}
{"text": "As hwei, He has lots of AOE tools in his kit. This makes him great in team fights.\n\nUnlike some champions in LoL, Hwei has built-in CC, which is helpful when it comes to making plays and getting picks.\n\nHe has many abilities, making him a unique and fun champion.\n"}
{"text": "Against lux, Lux is really strong once she unlocks her Ultimate n. At this point, she will be able to get killed and crush you. Once Lux has a maximum cooldown reduction, her abilities will be on really weak cooldowns. This means she will be able to poke and trade quite frequently. Don't let her cooldowns take you by her cooldowns. In the later stages of the game, Lux is really strong and can very easily remove any target if she lands her g. Try and place her behind in the early game so she can't get tons of AP and snowball."}
{"text": "Against karthus, If you see Karthus using his Ultimate e at the start of the fight, try to CC him so it cancels his Ultimate e.\n\nIf you kill Karthus at the start of the fight, try to reposition and get away from his Passive. This will reduce his damage output and make surviving the team fight easier.\n\nIf you spot Karthus in a side lane split pushing, you could start a team fight. But, you need to keep in mind that he can influence the existing fight with his Ultimate e. "}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, Try to blow up Tahm Kench, or CC chain him so he is unable to activate his E in the team fight. In the team fights, look for his Ultimate r. He can either use it to protect an ally, or catch someone out of position. Keep this in mind during the fight. Tahm can use his W to flank in a fight."}
{"text": "As zilean, Zilean's Level 6 is an important peak of power and will let him and his ADC save several times in the game. This makes the enemy's work extremely difficult, and the added layer of protection is perfect. Once Zilen gets all his abilities, all-in-and-defence capabilities skyrocketed. His combo Q > W > Q is already powerful. This combined with his p will make it or his ADC almost impossible to catch. Getting his first item will increase the damage to Zilean's poke by a considerable margin. He can try to shoot enemies independently, and his ADC can focus on agriculture and go to the end of the killings."}
{"text": "As xayah, Its first element will increase its duo and its survival significantly. Its ability to reduce damage in the way will also significantly increase. Each point in its E will allow it to cause much more damage to its enemies. Its daggers go a lot badly and easily catch the out-of-guard enemies. Once it gets level 6, it will inflict a lot of damage to its enemies. It will also be able to talk, and combined with its Flash and E, it can catch many out-of-guard people."}
{"text": "As jinx, Avoid going for prolonged jobs in this matchup as they will usually win them. Their level 6 is stronger than yours. Keep this in mind when you fight the position 6. Remember if you are weak. Focus on the steering and limit fighting early on. Wait for you to have some items so you can match their automatic attack damage. Keep the wave closer to your side of the map early on. It will help keep you safe, and they are still and you can capitalize on it with your Jungler."}
{"text": "As viktor, Stand away from the minion wave, this is especially important when he has upgrades his E.\n\nTry to match his pushing power once he has his E upgrade. His wave clear will be significant and you don\u2019t want to let him push you under his tower.\n\nAt level 6, both your kill pressure intensifies. Recall if you\u2019re low so he cannot kill you.\n\nThis is mostly a farming matchup, you both have poke tools but shouldn\u2019t really be able to all-in or kill each other unless one over steps."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Once Fiddlesticks has his Zhonya, it allows his R to really hit at home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonya, you can't attack him when he goes into the stasis. When Fiddlesticks has access to 3 abilities, it's really hard to manage because they offer him so much utility. If you're trying to go for a whole in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing. Of course, Fiddlesticks' biggest power peak is his 6. You can counter him by having constant guards around your track. If he's going to miss position 6, ping your teammates."}
{"text": "As akali, Both your E and Ultimate offer tons of outplay potential. You can often escape ganks or turn them around easily if you\u2019re able to play it slow and wait for the perfect opportunity to fight or escape. \n\nSquishy champions will often be left alone, or they will walk around the map unaided. You can use this to your advantage to snowball and get more kills as Akali is a strong assassin and can kill squishy champions easily. \n\nIf you\u2019re able to get a few kills in lane, you can snowball quite quickly and further your lead. Try to abuse any slight advantage you get to increase your chances of winning the game.\n"}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn\u2019s early game is incredibly strong. At level 1, do not let her bully you down with her basic attacks.\n\nUnlike other champions, Quinn\u2019s level 6 power spike doesn\u2019t offer her much in lane. But her Ultimate R does offer her a lot of roaming potential. As soon as she hits level 6 and goes missing, communicator with your team so they know shes left lane.\n\nOnce Quinn has completed her first item, her kill pressure intensifies. If you\u2019re behind, avoid fighting her at all costs as she will undoubtedly beat you in a 1v1. "}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine is an easy-to-learn champion. You don't need to spend so much time learning it compared to someone like Akali or Camille. She has a lot of CC thanks to her Passive, E and Ultimate R. She also has a healing and shield with her W. This makes her a great utility champion. Her Ultimate R has the potential to hit the entire enemy team. The more you hit, the more he will go. If you are able to get a good Ultimate Roff, you will increase your chances of winning the team fight."}
{"text": "As renata, It is rather squishy and easy to kill. Its Ultimate R is slow and easy to avoid. Not very strong in early play, which leaves it open to ganks and pressure from the enemy."}
{"text": "Against akali, In the team fights, Akali will seek to dive the backline and take out the most squishis champions. As soon as she engages, try to lock it with CC/ peel it away from you and your allies. CC is your biggest friend when it comes to beating her. If Akali engages and is hidden inside her W, step back from the Shroud until it disappears. This will make it much harder for her to fight and survive if she can't hide in it. In the last stages of the game, try to stay in the team and try not to wander the card alone. Akali has a ton of explosion and can easily assassinate squishy targets that walk alone."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Kayn will try to fight as much as he can in early play so he can get his shape quickly. Keep this in mind and be ready to fight back. Because of Kayn-S Ultimate R and mobility, make sure you look at yourself as you remember, and make sure you are standing in the middle of the way so it is easy for you to escape if it comes out nearby. Don't give him easily kill by window shopping when you remember. Opt for early maintenance. Kayn has a lot of support in the way thanks to the items he buys and his E. Having supported that fits him will make the laning phase much easier."}
{"text": "As pyke, Level 16 is a massive peak for Pyke because the ability will now be higher almost every team fight. The damage done will be quite significant as well, and it can take several enemies simultaneously. Pyke is remarkable in mid-game fights that its ultimate R threshold will be quite high. This means that it can easily catch the out-of-guard enemies and blow them up. Pyke is decent enough to get peaks during the end of the game. He can both set up death brushes and get rid of the squishy targets."}
{"text": "Against karma, Make sure you're still standing behind the minion wave so Karma can't use her Q on you. Stand behind the minions but not close to them because her Q is an AOE capability. When Karma uses her d, she will be vulnerable to attack. A good time to play aggressively is when she used to accelerate herself or her ADC up. Karma has her Ultimate has at level 1, so she will be strong enough up to level 6. If you're strong at level 6, you'll be stronger than she once you've both reached level 6."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio has a really strong laning phase when paired with an aggressive ADC. This will allow him to win lane and snowball his carry.\n\nHis Ultimate R is a great team fighting tool that can keep any one of his allies alive for longer. Using it at the right time could also enable him to get a 5 person knockup. \n\nGalio can assist his Jungler, his ADC, or his Mid-laner easily with his Ultimate R. His Ultimate R has such a large range that can allow him to move around the map incredibly quickly."}
{"text": "As teemo, Use the lane brushes to get an edge on the enemy laners. You can easily poke them with your t and auto-attacks as you will be hidden.\n\nIf the enemy laner roams, don\u2019t bother trying to contest their roam. Instead, push the minion wave and start earning turret plate gold.\n\nYou will want to riddle the lane brushes with your Ultimate t and use them as cover to keep chunking your opposition out. It should be pretty easy to do during the early game."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Avoid engaging in extended trading with the enemy in the game very early. Wait until you have a few levels below your belt before trying to fight. Play around your Q hot spots in the track, and avoid using them unless you are able to trade. When your Q is on the cooldown; you are pretty vulnerable and lose 1v1 fights. Make sure to make use of your Car Passive. If you are able to use it periodically on the enemy lane, your chances of winning the track increases."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid grouping too closely if the enemy has multiple knock-ups as it will allow Yasuo to get a really good Ultimate R off. Grouping but not standing on top of each other will reduce the effectiveness of his Ultimate R.\n\nDo not fight inside the jungle as it will make it easier for Yasuo to land his Tornado r knock up and follow it up with his Ultimate R. Fighting in the open will make team fighting more effective for your team. \n\nCC is your best friend in team fights. Locking him down with CC will make it very difficult for him to stack his r, dash with E and inevitably use his Ultimate R. Try to CC him as quickly as possible and take him down."}
{"text": "As sion, Getting to level 3 is going to be pretty important in this matchup so ask for a hard leash and quickly clear the Jungle. Once you're level 3, you can start ganking.\n\nTry to initiate ganks by using your E to slow down overextended enemies. This will mean that you will need to gank when a fresh minion wave is showing up.\n\nIn the first few levels, play safe and avoid committing to any duel. Your very early game is rather weak, so you\u2019ll probably lose trades versus an aggressive jungler.        "}
{"text": "As lulu, Focus on the enemy of the range and use your Q to slow down if they try to fly and catch up to you. It will allow you to scale and intimidate your opponent unabated. Do not push too far in this path without putting the right vision around. Junglers will certainly try to gank you because of your immobility. You can play more liberally once you get your Ultimate R. It will also allow you to lure enemies into diving when you are weak in health. Combined with your W, you can quickly secure the murders."}
{"text": "As rakan, Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability more frequently. It will be useful in mid-game fights. His selection potential is incredible during this part of the game. The attempt should be to work with his Jungler and get choices when possible. His team fighting potential is really high due to his W and Ultimate R. All he needs to do is not get caught, because he will certainly get him killed."}
{"text": "As rumble, At level 9, he will max his first ability. His trading power will intensify once he hits this level.\n\nSimilarly, Rumble will unlock his Ultimate at level 11. This will allow him to go for more trades and its damage output will be a little higher.\n\nTeams tend to start grouping during the mid-game. This is good for Rumble, as his Ultimate makes him a good team-fighting champion.\n"}
{"text": "Against sion, The more the game goes, the stronger Sion will be. Depending on his path of construction, he will culminate in different articles. Sion is strong at level 6 because he can quickly gank the ways out of vision. A deeper vision will be needed to reduce his efficiency. At level 9, Sion would have maximized his Q. His potential and his all-in-hand strength when the ganking will be very high."}
{"text": "Against gangplank, Try to shut down Gangplank early with the help of your Jungler. Gangplank will eventually outscale you in the progress of the game, so putting him behind will make it harder for him to take over the map.\n \nDon't engage with melee trades when Gangplanks Passive is up. It will help him win trades, so wait for him to use it on a minion before looking to fight.\n \nWait for Gangplank to blow up his Barrels E before looking to fight. If he has one placed in a nearby bush or has one under him, wait for it to blow before looking to fight. "}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Whenever he has 3 Towers Q up, he is always going to be a threat.\n\nAt level 6, when Heimerdinger unlocks his Ultimate R, he basically gets 3 new abilities. Take care when trying to fight him as he might just use any one of his abilities to trade with you.\n\nLevel 3, 6, 11, & 16 are Heimerdinger\u2019s major level spikes. Take care when he reaches those spikes as he may look to all-in you."}
{"text": "As trundle, Look at all-in enemies regularly with your basic capabilities. Use track brushes to your advantage and slow down enemies with your e & e. Remember to use your h during major battles. It will help you survive longer and allow your team to help you easily. Your Ultimate should be used to target the most powerful member of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As quinn, While she doesn\u2019t have a fighting Ultimate R, her Ultimate R is a great roaming tool that can allow her to get back to lane quickly and also roam around the map and help her allies.\n\nShe can blow enemies up who are alone when she\u2019s ahead. Look for picks on squishy and immobile targets to gain a further lead.\n\nPretty strong early game ADC who can go for aggressive plays with her early strength to get early kills and snowball."}
{"text": "As orianna, A maximum-out Ultimate d will leave Orianna a single shot of enemies if she manages to land an entire combo on them. Frozen battles will be the way to pass during this phase. Most of her abilities will be maximized during this phase of the game. She can both poke enemies down and protect allies with her d. Her team fight is excellent, and she can run enemies with ease. All she has to do is continue to hit enemies and multi-man landing ds."}
{"text": "As diana, In the last game, Diana should be close to full construction. Make sure to play around your active items and your Ultimate R to do the most damage in a team fight. The teams will regroup in the last game, and as Dianas Ultimate R is an AOE tool, it will do a lot of damage to enemies who are grouped closely together. At level 16, Diana would have put the third and final point in her Ultimate R. She will now do a considerable amount of AOE damage to all the supported enemies."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille Support can be aggressive from level 1, 2 and 3. Watch your positioning and stay far back and away from walls so she can\u2019t gain an early health lead.\n\nStay away from walls, especially whenever her E is up. She can get kills and make plays whenever her E is up. So play around its cooldown.\n\nAt level 6, Camille will look to make plays with her Ultimate. Track her Ultimate cooldown and play far back, and avoid overstaying your welcome if you\u2019re low to deter her form playing aggressive.\n"}
{"text": "As milio, Make sure you play around your Ultimate as much as possible. You are much stronger than Milio at level 6, so make sure you get them down first and then commit to an all-in every time you touch level 6. Pushing will prevent you from engaging and securing killings. Make sure you keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card throughout the previous parts of the game. Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card. It will allow you to all-in Milio and continue them in the way. If you push, its Jungler gank you and if your cage is down, you will die! Keep harassing Milio with your abilities while pushing the minion wave. Try to target your abilities so they hit Milio and the minion wave at the same time."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Make sure you're close to your team at all times so you can fight quickly. After your bot track has moved to the medium track, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to close and win XP. As you're good at getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambushed and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Rift Summoners alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby goal."}
{"text": "As ornn, His Ultimate R is an excellent tool that can set up his Jungler. It is also a good tool in 2v2 fights. Finally, it is great in team fights because it could potentially hit 5 enemies. Ornn scales incredibly well in the later parts of the game. It is one of the few champions that is relatively good at all stages of the game."}
{"text": "As swain, Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take control of the fights very easily. Its damage output will be quite phenomenal as well. His presence in the middle of the game and his combat style is really great. He can delimit the enemies and separate the enemy front line from the rear line. He can also choose targets out. The first ability will be maximized at level 9, adding a lot of brilliant damage to his kit."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Peel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight.\n\nYour W will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nEnsure you soak up as much damage as possible in late-game fights. You will be very tanky and able to take a lot of damage before dying. "}
{"text": "As akali, Akali\u2019s level 6 all in is much stronger than yours unless you\u2019re full health. If Akali is low on HP, look for an all in as soon as you hit level 6 as she will not be able to trade back with you.\n\nDon\u2019t bother using your W unless Akali is coming towards you with her E . Save this ability for that exact scenario so you can turn around the exchange.\n\nAs your Q has high cooldowns in the early levels, make sure you do not put yourself in danger while it is on cooldown as it is your main damaging ability. Once it\u2019s down, play safer and try not to trade with Akali as you\u2019ll lack damage.\n\nThe best time to fight Akali is when she is low on energy. She relies heavily on energy to trade with, so fighting when she is out of energy is a great way to create a health lead over her."}
{"text": "As amumu, Keep looking for opportunities for ganking whenever your Ultimate yis up. Play around the cooldown and look for as many ganks as possible. After successfully winning a team fight, look to take the Baron with your allies. Do not call for Baron if you are low, if the enemy Jungler is nearby or if there is a chance that you will be unable to take it quickly."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn is an early game bully and will try to harass and poke you as often as she can. Try and stay outside of her auto-attack range and be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP so you don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nOnce Quinn hits level 6, her kill pressure in a trade doesn\u2019t exactly increase as her Ultimate R is a utility tool. However, her ability to roam does. If she leaves lane, ping your teammates so they know that she is missing.\n\nKeeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game will allow you to get gold and XP without fear of Quinn zoning you away and denying you farm. Post 6, you shouldn\u2019t be freezing as it will give Quinn an opportunity to roam. "}
{"text": "Against xerath, Xerath has very reliable wave clear and push thanks to his low cooldown abilities and kit. Avoid taking unnecessary damage by standing outside of the minion wave when he uses his abilities.\n\nLook to trade with Xerath when his 2 or r is on cooldown. When he doesn\u2019t have either of these abilities, he is incredibly vulnerable. Mix this with his low mobility- he is easy pickings for any would-be aggressor.\n\nAvoid roaming if Xerath is in lane as he can push the lane very quickly while you\u2019re gone. Look to roam when he\u2019s either dead or in base."}
{"text": "As graves, Fighting near the ground is his bread and butter because of its functioning. It can help him to do a lot of burst damage in a very short time, and combined with his Passive, he can blow up any squissy target with ease. Its e allows him to avoid important skills and allows him to reposition quickly if he manages to make a false step. It also allows him to avoid bad situations as he can use it to get over the ground and easily disengage."}
{"text": "As riven, This champion is an early game bully. Play aggressive throughout the laning phase to get kills. If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate e is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate e is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, Shyvana is weak in early play, but if you trade with her when she has a lot of minions, it won't matter. At level 6, Shyvana gets access to a brand new kit. She will be much stronger when she has her Ultimate t. Plus, when she has a lot of Fury, she will be much more scary too. Shyvana's power peaks depend on her construction path."}
{"text": "As trundle, Trundle is quite decent during the late game as he will have his items and be highly tanky. His damage output should be pretty high as well.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate n will allow Trundle to take over fights way easily. He can quickly become tankier or deal more damage depending on which enemy he uses the Ultimate n on.\n\nTrundle is perfect during team fights. It will allow him to quickly blow up squishy enemies and slow their escape/advances. His e and e should help his team and him a lot."}
{"text": "Against karma, Karma has her Ultimate a at level 1, so she will be quite strong up until level 6. If you are strong at level 6, you will be stronger than her once you both hit level 6.\n\nDo not isolate yourself from the minion wave at all. Stand behind minions at all time (but not too close to them as her Q deals AOE damage) so they block the damage.\n\nWhen Karma uses her d, she will be vulnerable to attack. While it\u2019s on cooldown, that\u2019s your time to play aggressive and go for a favourable trade."}
{"text": "Against vayne, As Vayne is a ranged champion, when playing as a melee champion, be prepared to sacrifice CS for XP and health. Don\u2019t let her kill you in the early game as you\u2019ll make her late-game even stronger.\n\nIf Vayne ever uses her e, use the cooldown to play aggressive and try to kill her. She is rather vulnerable when her e is down.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will reduce her chances of zoning you away from the minion wave. It will also make her susceptible to ganks."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Try to harass and catch her with your abilities before starting a team fight. She's pretty squishy. If she uses her W trying to block incoming skill shots, look to start a fight while he's on cooldown. Gwen will be divided pushing in the middle of the game. You can use the number advantage to take down or start a team fight in her team while she's elsewhere on the map."}
{"text": "As viego, Once you get your base element, you should watch the enemy duel as much as possible. If the enemy plays too safe, wander another way. Helping your jungle should be really easy for you because of your E. Don't waste time on objective fighting, as you might be able to get a huge lead there. Your W will play a pivotal role during this phase of the game. Always make sure you land on a high priority target, as it can help you secure choices quickly."}
{"text": "As lux, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "Against twitch, After recalling, Twitch can enter the lane in stealth with his s. Avoid pushing up too far when you know Twitch has just backed as he may pop up and go for a favourable trade.\n\nTwitch benefits from extended trades. Try to go for short bursty trades over long ones with him when possible.\n\nIf Twitch has pushed the wave and left lane, he is either trying to bait you forward and go for a trade, or he has gone to the mid lane with his Support. Have consistent vision around your lane so you know what he\u2019s doing and where he\u2019s going."}
{"text": "Against talon, It is really strong at level 2 and 3 and can easily get a first blood early. To prevent Talon from moving, keep him pushed in while maintaining a good distance from him so that he is unable to jump on you and kill you. When playing as a varied champion, try to use your range advantage to abuse Talon as much as possible. Using basic attacks and capabilities to make it low will make it difficult for him to fight or jump with Q."}
{"text": "As irelia, Irelia\u2019s early game is strong. Look for plays to get an early kill on the enemy laner. If you can get one kill or get an early health lead, you\u2019re going to have an easier time during the laning phase.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, play aggressive and look for a kill. You should try to get them low before committing to the all-in, but it should be plain sailing.\n\nRemember your Q will reset if you use it on a low health minion. Keep a constant eye on the minion wave and look for these aggressive plays."}
{"text": "As ekko, When Ekko reaches level 3, he can start looking for aggressive parts as he would have unlocked the 3 of his basic abilities. Until then, he can fight, but he will probably not gain any significant advantage. As Ekko can do a lot of burst damage, once he has finished his Mythic article, his death pressure gets intensified. At level 6, Ekko becomes an incredible threat. He can go for risky parts and use his Ultimate R to escape. His Ultimate R can also be used aggressively, making it incredibly versatile."}
{"text": "Against yorick, When Yorick reaches level 6, he becomes so strong that he can 1v2 in some situations. Killing his Maiden R is your main priority when it is activated. While she goes up- avoid fighting him directly. Once Yorick has finished his first element, his damage release will increase. According to the matchup, Yorick can start playing super aggressive after he has finished this article. Yorick is pretty good in the middle of the game and he will seek to divide the thrust during that time. You will need to prevent him from separating by pushing otherwise with the help of his Maiden R, he will take goals for free."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Look for picks during the mid-game to get your team ahead. Getting a pick here or there or blowing an enemy Summoner Spell can be more than enough to get a nearby objective.\n\nCall for objectives during the mid-game. You\u2019re the Jungler afterall and need to prepare and make the call to take an objective whenever it is about to spawn.\n\nUsually, the ADC and Support will go to the mid lane after securing the bottom lane tower. If the enemy rotates to the mid lane too, you should look to gank them so you can get kills and the mid lane tower."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Destroying his E barrels before he can detonate can take a lot of damage from his kit. It forms a major part of his early play damage and without it, it will just be blocked agriculture and sometimes help his team with his Ultimate R. His W is an important spell in his kit and it is very weak once this ability is in decline during the early game. It really gets prone to ganks when this ability is in decline and it can really escape without using convocator spells. Fighting in open spaces reduces the efficiency of Gangplank as it has won."}
{"text": "As orianna, Use the track brushes to land your d and d will really be easy for you in this matchup. Just make sure you keep your distance from enemies at all costs. Remember that you can slow down enemies using your d. It can come in really handy when you getganked and need time to escape. Be part of the neutral objective fights once you get your Ultimate d. Your ability to move will allow you to get several choices for your team."}
{"text": "As ekko, In the middle of the game, Ekko will have finished several articles. He should be much stronger at this stage of the game. Combined with more articles, at level 11 Ekko will put an additional point in his Ultimate R. He will be able to look for more aggressive and risky pieces. At level 9, Ekko goes max his Q. He will help him farm and trade with the enemy."}
{"text": "As corki, Corki\u2019s b has quite a long cooldown. This can make him quite vulnerable while it is on cooldown. You need to play safer after using it, and avoid using it aggressively if the enemy Jungler is nearby.\n\nRelies heavily on mana to poke and push. Even though his Ultimate e doesn\u2019t cost a lot of mana, he can run low on mana quickly if he is constantly using his b and Ultimate e together. When he is out of mana, he isn\u2019t a threat and neither can he use his b to escape.\n\nCorki is a squishy champion. This makes it hard for him to survive the laning phases against champions with a lot of burst damage and poke."}
{"text": "Against drmundo, Dr Mundo has lots of sustain thanks to his Passive and the items he picks up. Make sure to invest in Executioner\u2019s Calling or another item that inflects grievous wounds to reduce his healing. \n\nIn team fights, Ignite will help reduce his healing, so make sure you Ignite him as soon as he engages. \n\nCrowd control is your best friend against Dr Mundo. If you can layer CC on him in a team fight, it will make it very hard for him to activate his Ultimate R and dish out damage. It will also reduce the healing from his Ultimate R if he activates it if you focus him down and kill him first."}
{"text": "As viego, Viego is decent enough during the team fights because of his W and Q. His life flight will help him during the full fights, and his Ultimate R will act as a decent finish movement. Viego will win a massive power peak once he has two points in his Ultimate R. He can run squishy targets, execute them and use his Passive for much longer than any other champion in his situation. He will have his basic elements through this phase of the game. He should be able to flatten a lot of damage and catch the out-of-guard enemies with his W. His E should help him shoot several ganks as well."}
{"text": "Against darius, Try to disengage and kite Darius when he engages in a team fight. Try not to let him ride to you or your allies as he can inflict tons of damage if he is within range to shoot e in. For AD champions, investing in a Calling Executer will help reduce his healing and survival in the way and in team fights. Do not stay in a team fight when you are weak as you could set up Darius for a Pentakill with his Ultimate e."}
{"text": "Against blitzcrank, Blitzcrank will play hyper-aggressive level 2 in attempts to get an early murder or blow your Summons. Make sure to hit level 2 before or at the same time as it is the first wave followed by the next 3 melee minions. Blitzcrank is useless and offers limited resources when its b is on cooldown. While it is down, make sure to make use of its vulnerability and watch to abuse cooldown. At level 6, Blitzcrank can do a surprising amount of damage. Try to avoid its Crochet b so it is unable to all-in you with its combo."}
{"text": "Against ivern, As Ivern will build utility objects to help his team, the search for choice before a team fight takes place will severely reduce Ivern's team fighting potential. Ivern will use his Bushes W to spot his team's vision. If a bush has been placed nearby- put two and two together and expect Ivern to be in the vicinity. Try and lock Ivern with CC as fast as you can. He's still enough and concentrate him first will prevent him from being able to heal and protect his allies with his W."}
{"text": "As alistar, Try to sit in the enemy Jungle whenever possible, as this allows you to flank the enemy when it is pushing upwards. You will also be able to catch the enemy Support while they are watching. Due to your short Ultimate cooldown, you should try to instill as many lap dives as possible. Your goal at this point is everything in the enemy ports, and then return to your portages while peeling for them. Keep the aggro turret on you if you have to, but drop it once you start down. With your kit, it should be really easy to secure peaks before major neutral fights. Do your best to play with the vision and fix death brushes when possible. If you manage to take the enemy Jungler before a major battle, your t & e should allow you to zone the enemy performs while your team takes the neutral objective."}
{"text": "As gragas, His Ultimate R can easily be dodged by enemies who have dashes or any movement tools.\n\nIf the enemy has good positioning in lane, it will be very difficult for you to engage or use your E in the lane. This is because your E can be blocked by minions if the target is not directly behind them.\n\nGragas\u2019s Ultimate R is very easy to mess up. You may want to use it aggressively to knock someone forward but instead, knock them backwards."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level 9 is a massive powerpike for Heimerdinger. It will now have maximized a capacity and will be paying a lot of damage depending on its maximum capacity. As ADC, it will probably be its Q, so it will have an easy time to clear and defend itself during all the in. Adding another point to its Ultimate R will skyrocket its overall power in the track. Again, it is because the powers will be more powerful, and Heimerdinger will use them both offensively and defensively. Heimerdinger excels during team fighting as he can control a large area with its Q turrets. This will be really useful in areas lit up like the objective pits and Jungle paths."}
{"text": "As talon, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, focus on the squishiest and easiest to kill high-priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline quickly. Make sure you're near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "As talon, If Talon falls behind it doesn't go to a single blow from the enemy. Make sure you get so much gold and XP in the early game to make your late game more impacting. If your allies don't have follow-up damage or CC, it will be difficult for you to help their roaming path. Once the enemy starts to group, you will find it harder to choose enemies and further your lead."}
{"text": "As xerath, Xerath's level 6 is convincing since it can sniper targets of one long range at a time in its track or in another. The output of the damage will increase with the items, so it will only make it more powerful. More points in its p will result in more damage to enemy targets. Slowing the target with sound 2 would be optimal to guarantee a p stroke on the enemy. Xerath's first item component purchase will give it two advantages. First, it will wave very quickly (which is vital to move around). Second, it will be able to use its capabilities more times that it will have an increased mana pool."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Morgana is good at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Until then, her kill pressure isn\u2019t the best, but it does increase once this ability is unlocked.\n\nOnce Morgana has Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass, her survivability in team fights will increase. Try and fight her when her Zhonya\u2019s is down so she is unable to defend herself. \n\nWhenever Morgana has her Blackshield E available, it will be difficult for you to kill her as it can block CC and damage. She will only use this to block lots of damage or CC, so bait it out before committing to the all-in."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton is an early dominant champion of the game. Expects that he plays aggressive and goes to kill. Every time Renekton is above 50 Fury, his next ability will be empowered. Stay at a maximum distance so he can't get an e or e empowered on you. Avoid fighting when he has tons of Fury too. Don't underestimate Renekton's reach with his Dash e. He can use it on the minion wave to close the gap and trade with you."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Heimerdinger can take objectives really fast in the late game thanks to his Turrets Q. Be prepared to make the call for them as you can often cheese them for free.\n\nLook for picks with your E to start the fight. If you\u2019re able to CC the whole enemy team, you will give your team a good chance of winning the game.\n\nContinue to peel for your allies to keep them alive in fights. You\u2019re good at peeling, so you should do so in the late game."}
{"text": "As gangplank, His Passive allows him to come out on top of short trades which is quite advantageous for him. Due to how well Gangplank scales, his Passive damage is really helpful in keeping his enemies away from him.\n\nHis E can be set from weird angles that can catch the enemy off-guard and cause a lot of damage. This is really good if Gangplank has access to the lane brushes in order to conceal his E barrels.\n\nWith his Ultimate R, he can impact any part of the map immediately and can act as an enabling force for his laners/Jungler to all-in their counterpart and get a lead. Besides, the longer the game goes on, the greater is the scaling for Gangplank due to his r gold mechanic."}
{"text": "Against jax, If Jax decides to fight as a team, try to lock him up with CC before he has the chance to engage. While his e will block the basic attacks, he is vulnerable to disengagement and CC. Jax will seek to divide the thrust in the last stages of the game. Always keep an eye on where he is at a given time. Do not let him take goals and open your base for free."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level sixteen will further reduce the cooldown of his Ultimate t and increase the damage of his mushrooms. Enemies will have a hard time traversing choke points now.\n\nHe will have a lot of ability Haste now, which means he can drop a lot more mushrooms around the map. The enemies will have to invest heavily in vision to keep themselves safe.\n\nHe will complete his build during this phase of the game, which will allow him to one-shot squishy targets. His t blind should come in handy during this phase of the game as well."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Always keep an eye on which Ultimate Sylas has. If his Ultimate R is a very strong team fighting Ultimate, try to wait for it to go on cooldown before forcing a fight.\n\nLook out for flanks as Sylas will often try to flank in a team fight with his E to get onto carries.\n\nMake sure no one on your team is stood too far forward or out of position as it may allow Sylas to pick them off his with his E and start the team fight."}
{"text": "Against volibear, At level 3, Volibear can gank a track as it has access to its Q. Expects it to look for a level 3 gank. After Volibear has finished his juggling article, it will be incredibly strong and difficult to manage. Avoid fighting it unless you have a clear advantage. Volibear gains a lot of trading power once it reaches level 6 and has its ultimate R available. Ping your allies if they are weak in health and you notice Volibear nearby."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, Aurelion Sol has a lot of utility integrated into its kit. They offer it tons of protection and manoeuvrability. It has tools to stop the ganks and protect itself from all in. Aurelion Sol is a very strong roaming champion thanks to its W. This will allow you to impact your sideways with ease after pushing your way. Thanks to its Q, Aurelion Sol has good poke and good clear wave. This will make the surge of the wave and trading much easier compared to many champions."}
{"text": "As sett, He can tank up a lot of damage during this phase of the game as he will have all his items, making him really strong. He will be quite a reliable front liner for his team now.\n\nA maxed-out Ultimate R will be up frequently, and clumped team fights will become a breeze during this portion of the game.\n\nHe is a decent team fighter during this phase of the game. He can regenerate his health quickly because of his Passive and his W true damage will melt through enemy health bars."}
{"text": "As sion, In team fights, he can easily get poked down by ranged champions. He can also get kited easily, which makes it hard for him to team fight sometimes.\n\nHe can find it hard to gank his allies without his Ultimate R. Pre-6, it will be hard for him to gank too.\n\nSion doesn\u2019t have the greatest objective control in the early game. If you\u2019re not able to take the objective alone, you\u2019ll need help from your bot lane."}
{"text": "As kindred, If she gets CC.D., she dies. Mobility is Kindred's main suit, and taking it away from it will make the enemy team's job kill her way. Her potential for escarming depends on her availability in W. Without it, she has not been able to use her Q systematically, which forms the pillar of all her escarming power. Her Ultimate R, so badly used, can easily lose her team a whole fight. It can even cost them a goal, especially if Kindred has not been able to get several points and is late on the levels."}
{"text": "As jayce, He is mechanically a very difficult champion. You will need a lot of games to master this champion. He will lack mana quickly, so you must always keep an eye on your mana bar. If you are behind, you will do no harm in team fights and your poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "As soraka, His E is very advantageous in group combats. He can send the enemy team into disarray and force to play defensively. His Ultimate R allows him to impact any fight on the map with ease. This allows him to change the results of skirmishes and duels throughout the game."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Cho\u2019Gath is a monster as the game goes on. He can easily eat an unsuspecting squishy target that is roaming through Summoners Rift alone. If you do not know where Cho\u2019Gath is, do not walk through the river isolated or without vision.\n\nCho\u2019Gath\u2019s abilities are crucial when it comes to winning team fight. Do not group too close together so he is unable to land his e on your whole team.\n\nWhen sieging an objective like Baron or Dragon, do not start it if Cho\u2019Gath is alive. With his Ultimate t, he deals more damage than Smite, so it\u2019s best to not take the 50/50."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Its early game ganks are quite powerful because it can turn between the tracks quickly and easily move the enemies. It should capitalize on it to ensure that it can take control of the game. Level 6 is a massive power peak as it can block the enemies and make sure it can show itself to the tracks that are being ruined. This will help it close the enemy. The first element will allow it to increase its global duel potential. It will do a lot of damage as well as launch more capabilities with it."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Take advantage of your range advantage and poke Tahm Kench whenever his Devour (W) ability is on cooldown. This allows you to harass him without the risk of being instantly devoured and taken out of the fight.\n\nBe cautious of Tahm Kench's all-in potential. It's best to stay attached to your ADC when his Devour (W) is available, as you can be an easy target for him to catch and disable.\n\nBy keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map, it becomes more challenging for Tahm Kench to engage on you effectively. This denies him the space he needs to make aggressive plays and increases your safety in lane.\n\nTahm Kench is particularly strong at levels 1 and 2 and may look to make aggressive plays during this time. Keep this in mind and prioritize your safety to avoid falling victim to his early aggression."}
{"text": "As maokai, Once Maokai's Ultimate R gets maxed out, the enemy won't have a perfect time in the game. Maokai's team will quickly capitalize on his CC, though.\n\nHis tankiness is massive during the late game. His Passive won't let him die while he dives the enemy backline, deals damage of his own to them, and ensures they can't join the fight.\n\nHe is decent during late-game fights as his W, and Q can easily CC a high priority target and prevent them from joining fights. This gives time to his allies to damage the other enemies or collapse on the CC'd target."}
{"text": "As leesin, Focus on farming early. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.\n\nHowever, if you do find a ganking or counter-ganking opportunity nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to take it.\n\nIf they invade you early, just back off; you do not win early skirmishes with them.\n\nLook to gank whenever your Ultimate is up, and try to clean up kills whenever possible."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Sylas is an early game strong Jungler. Expects that he starts to crash after level 3 when he has access to all the basic abilities. The stronger Sylas will become. Avoid feeding him in early play to reduce his strength in the middle and end of the game. Once Sylas is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, he can visit someone on the way to steal their Ultimate. If he steals yours, contact your team so they know he has your Ultimate."}
{"text": "As xerath, Distinguish yourself from the wave of minions as much as possible. This will force the Xerath to choose between pushing and drinking. Aim for your Q so it hits the wave of minions at the same time. Focus on agriculture and interference. It will be difficult for you to kill it. At level 6, look for harassing it with your Q. Then when it is low enough, use your Ultimate to kill it. It is squishy enough."}
{"text": "As yorick, Yorick's first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will give him an important boost and increase his overall level of threat to the enemy team. At level 11, his ultimate R will cause chaos as he will become more powerful and be able to divide the thrust in Yorick's name with respectable efficiency. If it is used correctly, he will put the enemy team in a losing situation. Yorick's real power counts on the split thrust, and he can really do it during the middle of the game with his ultimate R. If the enemy leaves Yorick incompetent, he will be at their inhibitors in a few minutes."}
{"text": "As renekton, The first element of Renekton will help him massively with his laning. Its duel power should increase quite decently now. Level six is a massive power peak for Renekton as he wins his Ultimate t now. It will allow him to initiate all-in and zone the enemy out in neutral and objective battles. Renekton is a fairly solid champion of the beginning of the game. Its ability to duel enemies and neutral impact objective fights is massive and should allow his team to dominate during the start of the game."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Maokai will look to gank as often as possible as he can gank the tracks fairly easily with his W. Maokai is good in team fights because his Ultimate R has a great effect zone. Make sure to separate or disengage as soon as you see it so he is unable to use this ability. Once he finishes his first article, Maokai will be really difficult to duel because he will really tanky."}
{"text": "Against ornn, In team fighting, avoid regrouping too closely because Ornn can use his Ultimate R to get a multi-person strike and start the team fight. Ornn has the ability to hit enemies who are close to his Q, terrain and walls. Avoid fighting in the jungle as it will allow him to land an easy strike. Ornn will tend to stay in a side track when there are no team fights and when there are no major goals. Use the numerical advantage to start a team fight while he is away from his team."}
{"text": "As kennen, Once Kennen has two points in his Ultimate m, he will be able to deal massive amounts of damage to the enemy team. He just needs to choose the perfect moment to go in.\n\nKennen is excellent in team fights due to his Ultimate m. He can pair it with his Flash for a devastating combo on the enemy team, which will leave them helpless.\n\nMore items mean more damage for Kennen. This will let him take over the game, and his poke damage will increase significantly in the game.        "}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 11 isn't a massive power spike because it provides her with nothing but a lower cooldown. It will allow her to get a lot of counter-ganks off though.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will allow her to dish out a lot of damage during duels which will be advantageous against squishy targets.\n\nHer team fighting potential is really high as she can deal a lot of AoE-based damage. Her C and E should come in quite handy.        "}
{"text": "As leona, Maxing out the Ultimate e will allow her to be on a very short cooldown. Leona will be easily available to look for peaks in about half a minute. As she gets more items, she will be able to absorb a lot of damage very quickly. This will make her a very reliable hirer, especially the fog of war. Leona's E and r will be maximized during this game stage. She can look for peaks frequently, and her Passive will allow her allies to break enemies with ease."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Putting the second point in Fiddlesticks Ultimate R at level 11 is very important to him. It will put his Ultimate R on a shorter cooldown and allow him to look for more aggressive pieces. At this stage of the game, Fiddlesticks should have finished one or two articles. Its damage release will be quite high that will allow him to win team fights mid-game. In the middle of the game, the teams start to regroup. It's good for Fiddlesticks because he benefits from teams regrouping closely because his Ultimate R is an AOE tool."}
{"text": "As reksai, Rek\u2019Sai has creative ganking routes that can allow her to dodge commonly placed warding spots.\n\nThis champion has a healthy clear as you can use your W, become burrowed and get some health back while you move from camp to camp. \n\nRek\u2019Sai is incredibly mobile which allows her to escape sticky situations with ease thanks to her E."}
{"text": "Against diana, Once Diana hits level 6, she can start to receive ganks from her Jungler as her Ultimate R deals a lot of damage and is CC. With this in mind, try to ward the river and side bushes to spot the enemy Jungler before they show up in your lane.\n \nWhenever Diana lands her Q, she could look for the all-in thanks to the reset on her t. Try and play safer when her Q has landed and wait for it to disappear before walking forward.\n \nDiana is rather weak if she doesn\u2019t get kills early on. With this in mind, try not to feed her and ping whenever she goes missing as Diana will look to roam if she can\u2019t kill anyone in mid."}
{"text": "Against leesin, If you meet Lee Sin at the beginning of the game, make sure to avoid his e if possible. If he is able to land him, he will probably surpass you. Try to disengage if he lands his e, or engage if he misses it. Lee can easily secure goals like the Dragon or Rift Herald on his own. Try and keep these goals kept when they are standing, or try to take them before he has a chance."}
{"text": "As leesin, They are going to be ganking early, and Pantheon can gank early too. Make sure you apply as much pressure to them as you can.\n\nBefore invading, make sure you have your Passive stacked so you can win the trade.\n\nIf they invade you, be prepared to fight, but only do so if your Passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just back off.\n\nPost 6, they win the 1v1 as they\u2019re stronger when their Ultimate is up.\n"}
{"text": "Against senna, Senna has good poke, harass and good disengage with her E. It\u2019s important that you engage as soon as you spot her to make it difficult for her to escape.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Senna will be in team fights. Try to end the game as quickly as possible so she is unable to be really effective in the mid-game.\n\nAs Senna will be going to ward alone in the mid-game, you could use this to your advantage to set up an ambush and take her down. While she is dead, you could try to start a team fight with the numbers advantage or take the Baron/ Dragon."}
{"text": "As lucian, Get Level 2 first and look for a favorable trade with the enemy. Earning an early health benefit will help you. Focus on agriculture and looking for aggressive games once the enemy uses a ability. Play around their abilities and seek to abuse their cooldowns with your early game damage."}
{"text": "As gnar, Once Gnar's E has fallen, he becomes sensitive to the ganks, so if his opponent manages to lure him, he will have a really difficult time to escape from this situation. Gnar's Ultimate R will not be very effective if the enemy plays in open spaces and is spaced evenly. This will force him to go for a more priority target that may involve flanking the enemy team, which can make him get caught and killed. The enemy can completely against him by choosing to disengage when he gets his megaform. Once his megaform has fallen, the enemy has not been under the imminent threat of being ulterated in a wall by him, and therefore will be able to fight more freely."}
{"text": "As corki, Continue to delay team fights for as long as possible while you harass and poke the enemy down with your b and e.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nThink hard and fast before using your Passive and b towards the enemy team. In particular, do not use it aggressively if your team is not in a position to follow up and go in with you."}
{"text": "As galio, If his E is missing, the enemy team can literally walk up to him (not within control) and continue to poach and harass him for a long time. Can't do much if the enemy keeps the river (if it is halfway) / track brushes (if it is in support). As soon as the enemy sees Galio coming out of the way, they will begin to play safely and deny the threat of Galio. Galio's effectiveness is greatly reduced if the enemy team positions properly and the spaces during a fight. He is decent against the magical damage but the AD champions can tear themselves through him, especially after using his E."}
{"text": "As nilah, The early game should be mainly focused on taking short trades against the enemy with your auto-attacks. Do not go for a prolonged trade unless the primary ability of the enemy is on the cooldown. However, play safely for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not fight until you have levels under your belt. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the medium track and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a golden lead."}
{"text": "Against teemo, At level 6, Teemo's pressure increases thanks to its Ultimate t giving it additional damage and the possibility to place mushrooms t all around the map. The more haste Teemo buys, the more it can place mushrooms t around the map. Try to take an unorthodox path to prevent walking through them. Nashors Dent is a central element for Teemo. It gives it a lot of additional statistics- which makes it more of a threat."}
{"text": "Against warwick, Warwick will look to pick someone off with his Ultimate R to start the fight. Make sure your flanks are warded so you can spot him before he is able to catch someone out of position. \n\nTry to poke and delay a team fight for as long as possible. Warwick is vulnerable to poke and disengage and if you\u2019re able to poke him down, it will be risky for him to engage.\n\nGetting Ulted R by Warwick in a team fight can be game-changing. Be prepared to Flash his engage if you have it up. If not, invest in a QSS so you can escape the CC or lock him down/ interrupt his channel with CC."}
{"text": "As udyr, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game. Getting them and securing the Dragon Soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nLook for picks with your team. If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "Against shaco, The Shaco is particularly strong if you play as a champion who needs everything in the beginning of the game. Melee Supports are very weak against Shaco in the beginning of the game due to its x. Once Shaco is level 6, it can be difficult for you to kill him in the way that his survival, damage and sneakness increases considerably. Shaco can assassinate targets during the middle of the game. Make sure you stay in team so he can't take someone."}
{"text": "As gwen, When you fight Gwen, try to bait her E first and then use your E so it's harder for her to avoid it. As you're big at duelling and early, try to make early games around the card to get yourself and your allies forward. You're pretty good at invasion, and as Gwen needs time to come online, try to go for an early invasion. Playing around your Ultimate is the key in this matchup. You lose opportunities to mess up when you're sitting on your Ultimate and don't spoil your allies."}
{"text": "As malzahar, He will now have his core of objects, which means that he will have a lot of mana and spam his Q and W. Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to make frequent use of capacity and make crucial choices. His silence will also be invaluable. Malzahar is pretty good during team fighting as he can silence enemies and can lock high priority targets without effort."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie is great in team fights thanks to the large AOE on her Ultimate R. When paired with her Passive stun, she will be able to stun multiple champions if they\u2019re grouped together.\n\nShe is easy to learn. Lots of pros, analysts and high ELO players recommend playing Annie if you want to learn the basics of the mid-lane.\n\nAnnie is really good at bursting down and ambushing squishy, low health enemy champions. Getting a few kills on Annie can make her Ultimate R incredibly scary. Look to pick off low health targets for easy kills."}
{"text": "As ahri, When Ahri hits level 11, she will have 2 points in her Ultimate. This offers her extra pick potential during the mid-game.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Ahri will have lower cooldowns which can help her get picks with her team. Her E will be on a shorter cooldown, which makes her an extra threat during this part of the game.\n\nWhen Ahri hits level 9, she would\u2019ve maxed her Q out. When combined with your ADC\u2019s damage, the pair of you will be a menacing threat during the mid-game."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Wukong's level 3 is quite strong. Once he has all his basic abilities, he can look for a favorable trade. Once Wukong's level 6 is hit, his death pressure increases considerably. Expecting that he is looking for murders once his Ultimate n is up. Wukong is strong in the mid-game team fights thanks to the AOE strike on his Ultimate n. Expect that he is looking for fighting by attacking on the side."}
{"text": "As sivir, Really good wave clear which allows her to shove the wave in and get lane priority with ease. This is really important as she can then secure objectives with her Jungler.\n\nHer E allows her to avoid major forms of crowd control. This makes laning easy for her and makes her quite safe when left alone.\n\nHer Ultimate R allows her to speed up the entire team, providing an enabling force for her engagers to all-in and destroy the opposition."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, If they invade you early, right back. This is especially true if they are early, because you won't win early fights with them Be proactive with your Ultimate, because they will seek to use theirs every time it's up. Force ganks with your R! As they will often gaunt in early play, you need to make sure that you also look at gank as often as you can and abuse your E. Focus on securing these goals. You need to take Rift Heralds and Drakes when you can!"}
{"text": "As lillia, Level 11 will be a decent power spike for Lillia as she will have an upgraded Ultimate R. The cooldown will be reduced, which will allow Lillia to make plays frequently in the game.\n\nHer Q will be maxed out at level 9. This is really good for her as her burst damage will increase exponentially, and she will be a menace to deal with.\n\nLillia excels during the mid-game due to her ability to secure picks. Her Ultimate R should help her a lot in catching out roaming laners and Supports.        "}
{"text": "As zed, Zed has an effortless time to kill anyone wandering alone in the fault. He can also install lap dives on the beaten track quite frequently. He just needs to push his wave before roaming. At level 11, Zed will have two points in his Ultimate R. This means that his potential at a stroke will be increased massively, and he will be able to destroy the isolated enemies with ease. At level 9, Zed will have his first maximum ability. This means that he will provide tons of damage to the enemy target, mainly if he uses his Ultimate R on someone."}
{"text": "As darius, Extended trades work in the favour of Darius thanks to his Passive. He will win almost every auto-attack battle. This makes him a great duelist in low ELO as many players like to constantly fight.\n\nDarius is really good in team fights thanks to his Ultimate e which can be reset if he gets the killing blow with it.\n\nHe has good gank potential and can start ganking after level 3."}
{"text": "As khazix, Kha'Zix is a really good early game ganker, especially when it involves low or overextended enemies. He needs to get access to all his basic abilities to make sure that the ganks are successful.\n\nHitting level 6 and getting his first empowered ability is a significant powerspike for Kha'Zix. He can either melt objectives quickly with his evolved Q or go for a more gank-efficient approach by evolving his E or Ultimate R.\n\nThe first component will give him a massive damage boost. This will allow him to take over the game relatively quickly if he keeps finding kills. During fights, he should always go for isolated back liners for maximal effectiveness."}
{"text": "As poppy, Her early game is weak as she lacks a reliable range, and her kit relies on the enemy mispositioning in the lane. She will have to play it out safely and use her Passive extensively.\n\nLevel six is a pretty good spike as she can now disrupt fights with the ability. She may also prolong the CC to an enemy if need be or use it defensively in some instances.\n\nThe first item component will allow her to deal more damage and survive all-ins easily. It should increase her overall skirmishing power.        "}
{"text": "As nasus, Your champion is weak in the early game. Avoid fighting until you have quite a few levels behind you. Once you have an item and some levels under your belt, you can look for skirmishes with the enemy.\n\nFocus on farming and picking up as much farm as possible in the early game. This will make you more of a threat in the later parts of the game.\n\nRotate and move around the map if your bot lane decides to rotate to the top lane after securing the bottom lane tower."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he gets three points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to use it frequently and deal a lot of damage to the enemy team at a go. He should be able to catch enemies off-guard easily.\n\nZac will have a lot of items during this stage of the game. This means that he will be getting a massive boost to his survivability and damage and will be a force to reckon with.\n\nZac will be massively tanky during this stage, and the enemy team will have a tough time killing him. This also means that he can act as an engager for a team and then revert back to peeling for his carries once the engagement is over."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio should be finished now. This will give it a massive peak in its ability to peel for the allied carts. Its damage production will be quite high as well. The Ultimate R of Galio will always be useful during the fighting due to its collapse and low cooling. It can quickly go to enemy territory to divert the vision of the area / set-up then return. Level 16 is not so great a peak for Galio. Although its Ultimate R cooldown is reduced and the range of casting is increased, it will have no incentive to use it for itself."}
{"text": "As malzahar, A maximum of Ultimate R will allow Malzahar to straighten out heavy amounts of damage. The enchanters and the squishy targets will find it hard to get away with it. He is strong during the fights at the end of the game while his Q and Ultimate R will hit like a truck now. He will have to check the enemy's inventory for a QSS before he decides to do everything in a champion, however. His Q and E will be maximized and will make a lot of consistent DPS during this phase of the game. The Q will allow him to keep the wave in check as well."}
{"text": "As karma, Stand behind minions at all times if possible. Stand behind them, but away from them so he can't poke you and push at the same time.\n\nTry and track Karma's Ultimate cooldown post 6.

As it will prevent her from denying you CS and XP>\n\nGood times to trade vs Karma is when they\u2019ve used one of their damaging abilities as they will lack damage to out trade you."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, If he can pull a single shot at the person he is aiming for, he will be controlled almost immediately by the crowd and killed on the spot. Unbelievably vulnerable once his Ultimate R is about to cool down. The enemy team should seek to fight him during this time and target him in front of anyone else. Not very effective against a group of champions because he is extremely dependent on the peaks to get a lead. Moreover, the crowd controlling him can allow the enemy team to get rid of him quite easily."}
{"text": "As lucian, Stay with your Support throughout the middle of the game. If you get away from them, you'll be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you're always close to at least 1 ally.

If he is above 50% health, don\u2019t bother aggressively trading.\n\nWhen fightin Darius, try to avoid long trades with him as he will come out ahead thanks to his Passive. Keep trades nice and short, preferably where you\u2019re able to stay outside of his E range.\n\nAlways keep mental distance between you and Darius.

If you keep your eye off the ball for 1 second, Cho\u2019Gath may end up hitting you with his e or m.\n\nCho\u2019Gath has a lot of sustain thanks to his Passive which restores health. Look to trade frequently or he will out sustain any damage you deal to him.\n\nCho\u2019Gath will get lots of sustain through his Passive and the items he buys. Try to match his sustain by starting with Corrupting Potion and buy items like Morello or Executioner\u2019s Calling to reduce his sustain."}
{"text": "Against braum, During the laning phase, Braum will look to be a meat shield for his ally by using Stand Behind Me W and Unbreakable E to nullify your damage. Try to go for a short trade first to bait it out and then commit to a trade while it\u2019s on cooldown.\n \nEnsure there is always 1 minion between you and Braum at all times. This will make it impossible for him to land his Q and potentially stun you.\n \nWhenever you\u2019re looking to poke or harass Braum, make sure you\u2019re not close to his minions so he cannot W to them and jump on you and turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As rumble, His first power peak is when he gets his first component element because it increases the damage output of his Q and E. Once you hit Level 6, Rumble will unlock his Ultimate.

Don\u2019t be afraid to look for 1v1 fights.\n\nYou will have multiple items completed in the mid-game. After your first item, you will be a lot stronger, and when you have 2, you will be a fierce opponent."}

However, it must make sure that it is not caught in the last game or otherwise it has no damage. At level 16, Brand can put the third and final point in its Ultimate R. It will be able to deposit a lot of damage on the enemies grouped in the late game team fights.

Avoid walking too far forward in a team fight as she may pick someone off who has stepped out of line.\n\nDepending on Vi\u2019s build path, she could look to assassinate targets that are walking around Summoners Rift alone. If she is ahead with lots of damage, do not go through the river if it\u2019s not warded. \n\nIf Vi initiates a fight with her Q, try to burst her down before she is able to activate her UltimateR.

This is good for him as he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight occurs. Also, his E will be on a short cooldown which allows him to escape skirmishes easily.\n\nEzreal is great in the mid-game, but he does start to fall of in the late game as it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}
{"text": "Against zyra, Zyra is strong at level 3 as she has access to both her Q and E. Expect her to dish out a lot of damage in a trade.\n\nOnce Zyra hits level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, her kill pressure increases dramatically and she can one-shot the squishiest of champions.\n\nAfter Zyra has completed Liandry\u2019s, her damage output intensifies. Watch out for her poke damage in lane. "}
{"text": "As janna, Janna excels during team fighting and fighting around landlocked areas. Her e can act as a source of engagement and disengagement depending on the situation and the comp enemy team, but her ability to let her team fight for a long time is what makes her so good. Obtaining several elements will greatly enhance her usefulness. She will never lack mana, and her shield force will increase by a lot. This, with the damage he provides to her doors will allow her to wear a back game. Three points in her d at level 16 will allow her to heal her entire team in a few seconds during a meaningful fight. This means taking neutral goals like Baron and Dragon after a comprehensive fight will always be possible."}
{"text": "Against shen, When there are no team fights occurring and when Shen\u2019s Ultimate R is up, you\u2019ll find him split pushing. Make sure there is someone who can match him in the lane with him so he is unable to split push for free.\n\nTake care as Shen has good ambush potential in the mid-game thanks to his E. Do not go to ward/ walk in unwarded parts of the map if you know Shen has been nearby as it may result in your death.\n\nForcing team fights when Shen is unable to impact them (such as when his Ultimate R is down) will help your team come out ahead. Force a fight once his Ultimate R is down."}
{"text": "As volibear, Make sure you opt for short trades against Volibear when possible. This will keep it at hand, but make sure that you trade after its E is down. Focus on getting your first element quickly. This will help you get a edge in the way, especially once you get serious injuries. Once you get your Ultimate, you should become more aggressive in this matchup. The point is to get it down frequently so it can't do much in the way. The wave has to be kept on your side of the tower to have a safe intake of ganks. This will help you increase until you can actually inflict damage."}
{"text": "As viego, Viego will have 3 points in his Ultimate R now, which will make him deal a lot of damage and will allow him to execute enemies with ease. This will come in handy during fights.\n\nViego will have multiple items by now. This will increase his damage and sustain and make it very hard for the enemy to kill him without CC.\n\nViego will have two of his abilities maxed out when he hits level 14. This means that his damage output will be really high, and he will ultimately take over the game."}
{"text": "As darius, At level 9, Darius would\u2019ve maxed out his e. His all-in potential and kill pressure is still very good during the mid-game.\n\nAt level 11, Darius will put a secondary point in his Ultimate e. If he gained a slight lead in the early game, he will be tough to handle in the mid-game, and he should be able to kill any enemy who tries to prevent him from split pushing.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Darius should\u2019ve completed a couple of items. He should be able to deal a lot of damage to targets, and also be somewhat tanky. The items he picks up makes him a huge problem during this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As morgana, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As gragas, Depending on your construction, you will either have tons of damage or tanking a lot of damage to your allies. Anyway, remember that you still need to peel for your ADC. Try to work with your Jungler and get spikes inside the enemy Jungle with your Ultimate R. Even the withdrawal of the enemy Support will give your team a considerable advantage when it comes to vision placements."}
{"text": "As ekko, In the middle of the game, Ekko will have finished several articles. He should be much stronger at this stage of the game. Combined with more articles, at level 11 Ekko will put an additional point in his Ultimate R. He will be able to look for more aggressive and risky pieces. At level 9, Ekko goes max his Q. He will help him farm and trade with the enemy."}
{"text": "As volibear, Once he hits level 11, he will put another point into his Ultimate R. This will make him more powerful and will cement his position as an engager on the team.\n\nVolibear's first ability will be maxed at level 9. This is highly beneficial as his dueling potential will skyrocket, and his ganks will become more potent.\n\nVolibear is good in team fights due to his E, Passive and Ultimate R. He should be using the fog of war and targeting essential carries on the enemy team when possible.        \n"}
{"text": "Against janna, Janna is very strong once she has a few points in her d. This can make it difficult for you to trade against her when she has her d available because she can come forward. Go for all the ins rather than short trades. Once Janna has her Ardent Censer, she will become really heinous in the way and look at poke whenever her d is available. Try to engage on her as soon as possible and don't let her lower you. Janna will always be strong once she has her d because he provides so much utility for her and her team. Watch to play hyper aggressive when she hasn't available to increase your potential to kill in the way."}
{"text": "As morgana, Morgana is decent enough in the team fights because she will be able to run the enemies with her Q and Ultimate R. Her E will allow her to warn her allies of the hard CC and engage. Adding 2 points in her Ultimate R will give her a massive peak of power. She will be able to use the ability frequently, impacting the team fights often. At level 9, her Q will be maximized outside. It will allow her to get frequent catches on the enemy, especially the fog of the war."}
{"text": "As zeri, Good compositions compared to the team with many shields. Its E allows it to escape sticky situations and to get away from the ganks easily. Z\u00e9ris versatile. It can either go AP or AD according to its team needs."}
{"text": "As gragas, Your level 3 is a massive powerpike for Gragas because it can now look for full-blown all-in on the enemy target. Positioning can cause some obstacle that its E can be interrupted by minions. Using river brushes or its Flash should quickly solve the problem. Gragas' level 6 is a significant power peak because it can now move key enemy targets during a gank or all-in. It can allow it to take the enemy rear line if it decides to go for the whole AP construction. It can also work with its Jungler and choose enemies with this ability. The first mythical element will give it a devastating peak of power. Its ability to a shooting target increases massively, and it will just need its combo time properly from now on."}
{"text": "As nasus, Split push and focus on securing towers while your team groups elsewhere on the map. Try to draw pressure while your team is able to get something done somewhere else on the map.\n\nBe prepared to group with your team when you\u2019re unable to get any more objectives alone. \n\nWhen you do team fight, make sure you peel for your carries. Use your W to slow the enemy frontline and then focus the nearest enemy champion in the fight."}
{"text": "As singed, Level 11 is a decent power spike as he will have another point in his Ultimate n. His overall damage dealt will increase, along with his resistances.\n\nAt level 9, his l will be maxed out. This means that he can deal a lot of consistent DPS during team fights if he manages to not get CC'd.\n\nHis tankiness will be really high, mainly if he uses his Ultimate n. It will allow him to do his primary job of running circles around the enemy team with his l.        "}
{"text": "As riven, The first item component will allow her to deal a lot of damage and survive the lane. It will also be conducive when trying to go for all-in combos.\n\nLevel six is a massive spike for her as she can now affect fights easily with her t and r. Her e usage will dictate how good a Riven she is.\n\nShe is a decent champion early on, especially if she manages to use the lane brushes to her advantage in the lane. Her all-in combo will be pretty potent if she catches her enemies off-guard.        "}
{"text": "Against jax, It is very good for the duelling. Once Jax gets his first element, it becomes much more difficult to duel unless you have elements that match his damage. Do not commit too much to fight him without a backup plan. As the game unfolds, Jax will become stronger and stronger. Keep an eye on him at any time he will seek to divide the thrust and take goals quickly."}
{"text": "As fiora, Its passive with its Q allows it to do a lot of damage to both the squishies and the tanks while allowing its team to do what they want. Its W is the most important ability in its kit and it can completely cancel any form of damage and CC with this ability. The fact that it can block the damage of the Ignite tick itself can be tilted for its enemies. When it is used correctly, it can even CC a group of enemy champions by running against any source of enemy CC. If it manages to find someone separated from their team, it can one against one easily, even if it is behind. This is due to the amount of damage that it can pull out with its Passive and Ultimate R. These choices can easily allow it to pressurize and take part of the card."}
{"text": "As ornn, The last point of his Ultimate R will give him a massive peak, and he will be able to ship tons of damage to the enemy. Since the ability will increase frequently, he will be able to easily choose targets with his team. Ornn is really great during the team fights as he can peel for his team and set up peaks for them if necessary. Any argument near the field will be favorable for him. His tankness will be phenomenal during this phase of the game. Combined with his misleading damage, it will become difficult to deal with him for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As shaco, After entering with your Ultimate I, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. Look for peaks in the later stages of the game. If you can choose someone, you should be able to turn to the Baron or the Old Dragon. Keep a constant eye on what major goal is fresh next. Do not divide push or go to the opposite side of the map when a major goal is up or on the spawning point."}
{"text": "As anivia, During the mid-game, Anivia should have her Tear fully stacked. This will be very helpful for her as it will prevent her from running out of mana when using her Ultimate m.\n\nAt level 11, Anivia will have 2 points in her Ultimate m. Not only will it heavily increase her damage output, but it will make it hard for the enemy to siege any objectives as she can easily clear the wave.\n\nAnivia is good in team fights, and the mid-game is usually when teams start grouping. This makes her a good mid-game champion."}
{"text": "As zyra, Your immobility is your greatest weakness on Zyra. Therefore, you should always be aware of your positioning in the way and in team fighting. During a fight, always stay away and avoid crowd control capabilities. Once locked, you have not been able to do anything to save you and will probably be killed if the enemy follows you."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lissandra's first element will allow her to break out more effectively. It is very beneficial for her team as she can wander around a large number. Lissandra will get a massive power peak at level 6 due to her ability to chain CC an enemy to forget. It is really useful when it comes to a fast or mobile transport. Putting several points in her Q will make her more powerful. It will allow her to get out quickly and allow her to do a lot of damage to enemy groups."}
{"text": "Against samira, Whenever Samira has max Style points, she will be able to use her Ultimate R. Avoid trading with her when she has max points.\n\nAt level 6, Samira\u2019s kill pressure increases as long as she has max Style points. Take care as she may look for an all-in when she is at point A.\n\nSamira is at her weakest when she is out of mana or out of Style points. Looking to fight when she has very little of either of them will increase your chances of killing her."}
{"text": "Against camille, Try and stand in the middle of the lane at all times. This will make it harder for her to land her E in a trade. Don\u2019t get close to the walls as this will give her the opening to engage. \n \nIf you\u2019re playing as a ranged champion, try and harass Camille with basic attacks whenever she tries to last hit. Camille lacks sustain in the early game, so you can poke her out of lane easily if you keep auto-attacking. \n\nIf Camille uses her E in lane, she will be vulnerable while it\u2019s on cooldown as it\u2019s her main way of disengaging from ganks. Bait out her E prior to your Jungler arriving in your lane to reduce her chances of survival."}
{"text": "As lulu, Hit Level 2 first and then use your level advantage to gain a meaningful health advance. You need to get some reduction of healing as soon as possible. If you don't, then Lulu will just go out supporting and curing all the damage you're doing to them or CDA Their Ultimate offers them a ton of extra pressure to kill. Play smart and remember when you're weak so Lulu can't use their Ultimate on their ADC to get a kill in the way."}
{"text": "As naafiri, Go in a side lane and start applying pressure to towers while your team does the same.\n\nEnsure you\u2019re also using your Ultimate and constantly looking for ganks with it.\n\nSupports will start walking around the map alone in the mid-game. Capitalise on this to get yourself free kills.\n"}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Its passive can cause chaos when it is used properly in a fight. This is especially true when it tries to flank the flanks as Jungler or when it tries to wander in another way after pushing its way. It is superbly strong when it comes to fighting in closed areas. It provides it with a complete use of its W as well as to do a lot of damage. Its effigies help it with the same and can be used to secure and erase a lot of vision for its team. For the side track, or while the track is gauntling, it can make full use of the track brushes for bamboo enemies. It can continue to hit the enemy team with its E and with good itemization, its E can do a lot of constant damage. Silence is also very valuable, especially against the enchanters."}
{"text": "Against fizz, When you play as a melee champion, don't go for prolonged trades with Fizz because he'll always go out ahead with his W. Unless you take advantage of any other wave manipulation, try to keep the wave even or closer to your side. This prevents him from engaging with you or continuing down. Fizz has a potential for crazy roaming. Don't follow him blindly because he can easily turn around and kill you."}
{"text": "As diana, Try flancing in the team fights with your Q and t to access the enemy rear line and close them. Flank on the side instead of running directly to the enemy as they will be able to disengage or drop you. When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done. Avoid overextension or die alone. When you are dead, the enemy may be able to sit a goal, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "As vex, Once Vex hits level 3 and gets access to each of her abilities, she could look to play aggressively and make a play.\n\nUnlocking Vex\u2019s Ultimate R at level 6 is a valuable power spike for her. Expect her to play more aggressively when her Ultimate R is on cooldown.\n\nEarning enough gold for her first component item offers her extra trading potential in lane. Her damage output will increase and she will be stronger after this.\n"}
{"text": "As sion, Sion can cheese the enemy at level 1. Thus, his level 1 is very strong in the Support role.\n\nAt level 6, Sion can get set up his ADC or his Jungler in lane to get kills. If he can\u2019t set anyone up, he can look to roam and help his Mid or Top laner instead.\n\nAs soon as Sion upgrades his Boots, he can roam with ease. This combined with his Ultimate R makes Sion a good roaming champion early.\n"}
{"text": "As rumble, Another point in his Ultimate b will seriously tip team fights in chokingpoints in his favor. All he needs to do is time it well and drop it at the appropriate places. He will now have several items at his disposal. This means that his damage will increase considerably, and it should have an easy time to melt through the enemy health bars. The presence of Rumble during mid-game fights is really fabulous. He should be able to win several fights just by using his Ultimate b correctly."}
{"text": "As xayah, Three points in her Ultimate R will give her a huge power spike. The ability will be up frequently, allowing her to use it defensively to get away from bad situations.\n\nHer life steal combined with her damage during the late game will make her really good in team fights. She will just need to maintain proper positioning and use her E at the right time.\n\nShe will have multiple items during this phase of the game. It will allow her to dish out tons of damage. Prolonged team fights will see her winning them, but Xayah will definitely need some peel."}
{"text": "Against bard, Bard will leave the road to take Chimes when he's safe. Abusing the fact that he's missing everything in the enemy CDA. Try and stay away from the minion wave at all times. This will make it really difficult for him to land his Q and stun you. Do not stay too close to the wall so he can't stun you in this way either. When you play as a melee champion, don't stay too close to him or the minion wave or else he can bring you down and harass you with basic attacks. Walk forward when you want to harass or hit the last time, but return to safety after."}
{"text": "Against vayne, Vayne will be often left alone to split push and farm. While she\u2019s away from her team, you could look to collapse on her and take her down. Do not commit multiple players to killing her though if she\u2019s bot side and the Baron\u2019s up.\n\nVayne is prone to CC. Locking her down at the start of the fight will make it incredibly difficult for her to kite, deal damage and win the team fight.\n\nPlaying around her Ultimate n  will be a great way of increasing your chances of killing Vayne in a team fight. Forcing a team fight one after another will decrease her chances of surviving in the next one."}
{"text": "As akshan, At level 9, Akshan will max out his Q. This is really important for Akshan as maxing his Q offers him a lot of extra damage.\n\nWhen Akshan puts the second point in his Ultimate at level 11, he will find it quite easy to execute enemies.\n\nAt this stage of the game, teams will be grouping. Akshan\u2019s w will be really good at this stage of the game because he can bring back a recently deceased ally.\n"}
{"text": "As ezreal, The junglers can camp it at this stage as well as it will no longer have any other form of escape, and its E has a very long cooling period. It takes enough time for its itemization to work. It also depends on the fact that it is very skillful to shoot hard and that it will have to place its Qs on the enemy to be effective. Bouffer its E won=t works too well if the enemy has some form of varied CC that it can use to follow on Ezreal after using its E. This obliges it to play a little more defensively, and it cannot push in the wave either, otherwise it can be crushed by the enemy."}
{"text": "As morgana, Morgana is quite decent in team fights as she will be able to run down enemies with her Q and Ultimate R. Her E will allow her to ave her allies from hard CC and engages.\n\nAdding 2 points in her Ultimate R will give her a massive power spike. She will be able to use the ability frequently, impacting team fights often.\n\nAt level nine, her Q will be maxed out. It will let her get frequent picks on the enemy, especially from the fog of war. "}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, At level 6, Mordekaiser\u2019s kill pressure increases. Whenever his Ultimate R is up, you need to play more respectfully.\n\nMordekaiser has a strong all-in potential as soon as he hits level 3, but before that he can be poked out of the lane. Abuse him as much as possible before he hits level 3.\n\nTeam fights are where Mordekaiser can shine. If you\u2019re a carry champion, make sure you invest in a QSS so you can get out of his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As brand, Hecarim can invade the Brand often. Do it as much as possible to set him behind.\n\nYou are a good counter-ganker. After Brand has gone in, try to counter-gank him as you can easily turn around his ganks.\n\nPlaying around your Ultimate is very important. Look to gank whenever your Ultimate is up.\n\nHecarim can easily take those objectives. Get your team ahead by soloing them."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce doesn't really have a peak at level 6 due to his Ultimate G of level one. This also means that he has access to three other variations of ability that his opponent. He should use them to get a pre-6 lead. Jayce is weak early on and relies on his combo w > s to get the enemies out before going for a murder. This will allow him to win an advance and explode the enemy once they are low enough. The track brushes must be used tirelessly to ensure the quick domination of the track. The first component will give a boost to the damage to Jayce and will allow him to play more aggressively. It will allow Jayce to go for frequent gusts after throwing the enemy with his combo w > s."}
{"text": "As sett, Can be kited to oblivion, especially when he is against a ranged carry with some form of dash or peel.\n\nMisuse of his W can get him killed as it is his only form of damage mitigation. He can\u2019t escape easily if someone all-ins him after he uses this ability.\n\nIf the enemy is smart, they will avoid grouping up during fights. This will prevent Sett from using his Ultimate R effectively, as he won\u2019t be able to land a lot of damage or slow multiple members of the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid grouping too closely if the enemy has several knock-ups as this will allow Yasuo to get a very good Ultimate Roff. The grouping but not standing on each other will reduce the effectiveness of his Ultimate R. Do not fight in the jungle because it will be easier for Yasuo to land his Tornado to hit and follow him with his Ultimate R. Fighting outdoors will make the team fight more effective for your team. CC is your best friend in team fighting."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Poke the enemy and harass them as much as you can before trying to fight. Bursting someone with some Q.S. and your Ultimate R will allow you to force a team struggle with numbers or health advantage. Avoid using your E aggressively in the fights at the end of the game that you will be vulnerable briefly. Use it only aggressively if you are 100% sure you can't be abused for it. Stay with your team and avoid walking too far away from them. If you are caught out, your team will lose on a lot of damage in a team fight, and that would be your fault."}
{"text": "Against trundle, When Trundle activates his Subjugate n, back away immediately. He will become much tankier and your tanks will be weak. Re-engage when his Subjugate n has cooled off.\n\nAs Trundle will be split pushing a lot in the later stages of the game, try to team fight when he is not able to be there. If you spot him isolated and away from his team, try and force a team fight with his allies.\n\nAs soon as Trundle engages in a team fight, try to lock him down with CC. While he is a tank, he is very vulnerable to hard crowd control."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan\u2019s level 2 all-in is pretty good. Once he unlocks both his d and e, he can look for a favourable trade.\n\nDepending on his build path, he can either deal a lot of damage, be incredibly tanky, or offer his team a lot of utility. It all depends on his build! This makes Jarvan incredibly versatile. \n\nHis Ultimate m is really good in team fights as it can lock down multiple enemy champions at once."}
{"text": "As samira, Samira fights for the team fight if her team has no follow-up engaged. Once she enters, the enemy will just concentrate it if she is alone. He relies heavily on items in the middle of the game. If she is behind, she will fight to bring down a lot of damage. She is vulnerable to indiscretions and damage when her E and W are both below. She will not be able to block incoming damage or avoid/disengage from it."}
{"text": "As leesin, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nThey can secure objective so much easier than you can. Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nPost 6, avoid fighting them at all costs as they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will easily kill you.\n\nA good player will be playing around their Ultimate as often as it comes up. You need to counter their ganking pressure by doing the same."}
{"text": "Against ahri, Ahri is not very early and needs a little time to come online. Do not play too aggressive in early play especially when your E is on the cooldown. Constantly look at poke and chip away at the enemy health bar before looking for all-in. In team fights, look to peel at the beginning. When an enemy walks too far forward or is taken out of position- look at all-in them."}
{"text": "As trundle, Prone to disengage and all-in. In hard matchups, it will be impossible for him to do much without ganks.\n\nIf Trundle falls behind early after a misplay, it will be really hard for him to get back into the game as he will be behind in gold and XP.\n\nTrundle needs to play aggressive early. If he can\u2019t, then Trundle will not be as strong as he could be. You pick Trundle for early aggression and to make plays. "}
{"text": "As ryze, Can dish out a lot of burst damage while moving around quickly during team fights. This makes it very hard to catch him and kill him in a team fight.\n\nGreat objective control due to his Ultimate R. It can allow him to transition from a Dragon to Baron almost immediately. He can also pull backdoors off with this ability.\n\nThe CC on his W allows him to set plays for both himself and his team. This can be really effective if he manages to CC a high priority target, and get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "As warwick, His E can allow him to take reduced damage in team fights as well as disrupt a fight with fear on his E. This can allow him to change the tide of a fight quite easily. His W can allow him to detect ill health enemies on the map. He can then use this information and communicate with his team. This can allow him to take free goals and secure the dead on unsuspected enemies."}
{"text": "As riven, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen is difficult to play into ranged champions. They can constantly harass and bully her which will make it difficult for her to survive the early game.\n\nYour Q will only be as impactful as you make it. If you use your Q without multiple stacks, the damage will be futile.\n\nHer W doesn\u2019t block tower shots, but it does increase her defensive stats. With this in mind, always think twice before committing to tower dives."}
{"text": "Against volibear, Volibear is a very early Jungler game and will look to gank a lot. Ward its jungle entrances to make it harder for him to get successful ganks. It's good Dragon and objective control in the game early. Make sure you keep the Dragon monitored at all times so you can spot it before it is able to take the goal. If you know Volibear has its ultimate R available and you see your allies on weak health, ping them to remember. Volibear has an incredible diving potential and can pick up free murders under the towers."}
{"text": "As kennen, Stay in your minion wave to avoid being labeled by Kennen's 1 easily. If it strikes, it can follow it with a t in the self-authorized attack for a trick. After Kennen gets his m, his lethality is very enchanted. If you try to fight without your Passive or over half of your health, Kennen can easily counter your E with his m to put his entire kit on you without a way for you to escape it. You will not be able to decide where the wave goes in this matchup. However, try to keep the wave close to your turn if you can, then you can try a commitment once Kennen is not too close to harass you. Be aware that Kennen can use his h to gain a great speed of movement."}
{"text": "As nami, During the laning phase, focus on the descent of the enemy to get a health benefit. When the enemy is low, commit to an all-in. Try your hardest to keep your ADC alive as long as possible in the way. Provide them with W healings whenever they need it. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Hard engagement is the best way to deal with Ezreal during the laning phase. But you will need to wait for him to use his E if your CC is a skill shot. Ezreals poke damage starts to stack if you take too many Qs in the face. Make sure you are still standing behind the minion wave at all times. In team fights, you must not let Ezreal fall before you have the chance to engage. If it is isolated, run on it as fast as you can to start the fight. Do not delay team fights against an Ezreal."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, You should spend a lot of time dueling and killing enemies who are pushing carelessly in the side lanes. Make sure that you use the fog of war to the fullest.\n\nAll your items should be ready by now, making you an extremely powerful duelist. Try not to get CC'd during fights and kill the squishy targets first.\n\nSince you are a dive-based champion, try to get a defensive item when possible. This will let you survive for a longer time. Also, prioritize tenacity."}
{"text": "As sett, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make it easier to access the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}
{"text": "As sona, Very squishy during the early game which makes her quite disposable and easy to set back. She can\u2019t do much if she gets camped in the lane.\n\nHas no form of priority in the lane during the early game as her Q does meager amounts of damage and her W is best not used until absolutely necessary.\n\nMissing her Ultimate R guarantees a team fight win for the enemy team and reduces Sona\u2019s usefulness by a huge amount. Improper usage of her Passive can yield the same results."}
{"text": "As senna, Senna Passive makes her scale unlimitedly. This is good as Senna can easily transition into carrying her team during the game's later stages.\n\nSenna is excellent in late-game fights due to her Passive, heal, and damage. Her positioning will matter a lot, and she should aim to take fights that happen near choke points.\n\nShe will have multiple items by now, making it easier for her to one-shot squishies. With enough Passive wraiths, she will be able to deal with tanks quickly as well."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas manages to get to level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate R. This means that he can initiate fights and displace key enemy targets way more frequently.\n\nAt level 9, Gragas will have his first ability maxed out. This is really beneficial for him as the damage increase will really help him duel. This is especially true if Gragas is going for the full AP build.\n\nDuring the mid-game, the enemy will be busy swapping lanes and setting vision. However, as a laner, he will use this ability to the fullest potential when fighting around clumped areas and neutral objectives."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand is an incredibly motionless champion. It makes him more than one target for the ganks and CC. Brand is also one of the champions who dies the most in the game! As Brand is a poke mage, he relies a lot on mana and can run low quite quickly and he will be unable to use his aggressive W if he is out of mana. You must always keep an eye on your mana pool at all times. In addition to being quite still, Brand is also pretty squishy. It's really important that you don't let the enemy poke you down or land poke that you will have to play passively. You will also need to play much safer when your Flash is down."}
{"text": "As brand, When Brand has hit level 3, he will be able to activate his Passive for maximum damage as he will have access to all 3 of his basic abilities.\n\nBrand\u2019s second power spike is once he unlocks his Ultimate R. It will offer him a lot of additional damage and will help him blow up any squishy Support or ADC.\n\nOnce Brand has picked up the first component item to his Mythic, his damage output will increase heavily. You will see a significant increase in damage with more items and more points in your W."}
{"text": "As anivia, Every time Anivias Passive is down, she's incredibly vulnerable to an all-in-one. Play safer every time it's on the cooldown. Her t is easy to avoid. If she's missing, she's incredibly vulnerable to an all-in-one. You should only throw her out if you're sure you can land her. Anivia relies on mana and will need to get a Tear on her first back. This can delay her Mythic which makes her slightly weaker than the enemy will get their Mythic article before her."}
{"text": "As janna, Janna is a very mobile champion thanks to her d. This allows her to easily escape sticky situations. She is a bully of the lane and can easily harass and harass the enemy over and over again. An aggressive Janna can win solo the lower way.

If they\u2019re in a choke point in particular, it will be hard for them to escape him.\n\nHis Ultimate n makes him incredibly tanky and hard to kill.

Your best bet is to just avoid them and focus on farming early.\n\nHowever, they are a stronger ganker than you in the early game, so be prepared to counter-gank and track them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get a lead from easy ganks, try to invade their jungle and steal away their camps.\n\nPost 6, look to make plays and gank your allies whenever your Ultimate is up.

Your Q has a vast range and hitbox, so make sure that you target both minions and the enemy simultaneously.\n\nKeep track of your Passive timer as it is the difference between a won fight and a lost one. If the enemy relies on diving you, W them to fear them and reposition quickly.\n\nUnlocking your Ultimate R will allow you to roam around freely after shoving the wave in.

{"text": "As bard, Your goal is to hit level two before the enemy and look for an all-en with your Q. Hold on to your Q until you get a little closer to your target, or use it when the target is pinned against a wall. Keep collecting chimes while you are laning. You need to unblock the slow on your automatic attacks and get 5 chimes will allow you to do so. Once this is done, you can place your Q very easily. Always be on the lookout for roaring around the map. The best time to do so will be when the minion wave pushes towards you and you have left the way to collect some chimes. Use your E correctly and possibly paired with your Jungler for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "Against nocturne, Nocturne needs to get level 6 as fast as he can to be able to use his Ultimate has for gank the tracks. Once he hits this power peak, he will look to gank actively whenever his Ultimate is on the rise. Nocturne is a good assassin and will try to kill any isolated target including the position out of mi and the end of the game. Avoid letting him pick up the free dead while remaining in the team."}
{"text": "Against karma, Karma has a potent early game and is quite strong from levels 1 to 3. Try to not let her poke you too much by hiding in between the minion wave and backing off when she moves forward.\n\nRemember that Karma has her Ultimate a at level 1 and can dish out lots of damage if you\u2019re hit by her empowered Q.\n\nKarma doesn\u2019t spike as well as other Supports at level 6 as she already has her Ultimate a at level 1. You can use this to your advantage to kill her at level 6."}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, Jarvan's level 2 is strong enough because it can go for a d en e and get you up. Make sure you touch level 2 first so that you can counter this engagement. Once Jarvan touches level 6, its death pressure gets intensified. If you are without Flash, it can easily lock you up with its Ultimate m that will leave you incredibly vulnerable. After Jarvan has finished its first element, its utility and its strength increases. Keep this in mind that its shield of Aery and its d will be increased."}
{"text": "As azir, Your ability to control a zone/area is quite strong and almost unparalleled.\n\nYou can dish out a lot of consistent damage if you are given the chance. Your sand soldiers and Passive make it much easier for you to stop all-ins in their tracks.\n\nVery high sieging and pushing power when it comes to taking lane towers.

Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As lulu, You will now have your basic objects, and you will be able to intimidate your laner unabated. Keep on your W for situations where you have to interrupt your laner. Continue with your assault after that. Use the track brushes to your advantage in the way to catch the out-of-guard enemies. The best time for all in someone will be when one of their powerful spells (like a mobility spell) is down. Always be ready to help your Jungler if they decide to invade the enemy Jungle or take the Rift Herald. Your ultimate R can really save your Jungler if they are stuck in a bad situation."}
{"text": "As senna, Really effective long ranged poke and Passive procurement agency. Her poke also allows her to heal up with her Q, so she is really good against poke.\n\nHer W can allow her to CC an entire group of enemies with utmost ease.

When he places a Soldier W, move to a safer position out of its range.\n\nGo for a trade after Azir\u2019s Soldier W has disappeared. It\u2019s best to wait for the Soldiers W to disappear first before fighting him as his damage output will be decreased. \n\nAfter level 6 keep a keen eye on the map and Azir\u2019s mana bar.

{"text": "As ryze, Ryze's weakness is quite amazing during the start of the game, so he should make sure he plays safely and carefully around. The main objective is to increase first. His level six will not be very impacted during this phase of the game because he has a long cooldown, and roaming during this phase would be a problem. The first element will allow him to inflict a lot of damage to his enemies and spam his abilities frequently. Nevertheless, he should not play too aggressively and simply rely on the scale."}
{"text": "As viktor, His d is the only form of self-peel for him. Once this ability is lowered, he is quite vulnerable to ganks. In team fights, he can be flanked with ease too. He will try to play safely during the early match and will not have much damage if he can't upgrade his passive core. Playing aggressively and forcing him out of the early track can allow his enemy to get a huge advantage over him. Very subject to all in, especially in the bot track when against a hard crowd control Support. He has some form of buff motion speed with his r but in layers crowd control can easily counter that."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Veigar is at his weakest in early play. Try to abuse him to put him back. Delaying his batteries will make him less effective in the later stages of the game. When Veigar uses his n, try to abuse cool down as he is his only defensive tool in early play and once he is quite vulnerable. In order to get ganks or kill the Veigar, you need to bait his n first. You can do it by constantly tipping into and out of range of him. Make sure you always bait him before you commit to the whole."}
{"text": "As thresh, Pay close attention to your positioning when you want to harass Thresh. Stand behind minions to block his Q (Death Sentence) skillshot, making it more difficult for him to engage or initiate trades.\n\nKeeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map provides better gank opportunities for your jungler. It forces Thresh and his ADC to overextend, making them more vulnerable to ganks and potential kills.\n\nWhen Thresh goes missing from the lane, immediately ping and communicate with your team. Thresh is known for his roaming potential, so it's crucial to alert your teammates to the potential threat and adjust playstyle accordingly.\n\nAvoid getting too close to Thresh, as he can use his E (Flay) to interrupt your movement and CC you. Maintain a safe distance and stand far back to make it easier to dodge his E and Q abilities respectively. Respecting his threat range is essential for your survival."}
{"text": "As shyvana, In the middle of the game, focus on stacking your items and see if you can help your allies get killed around the map. This will help your team a lot, especially if you can catch enemies out of the war fog. Look for peaks during the middle of the game. It should be easy enough for you because of your a and l. Don't forget to use your Ultimate t frequently. By sitting Baron or Dragon, or when you push the enemy under their turn, look for a peak with your abilities.

This helps a lot in catching enemies off-guard and executing your 100 to 0 combo post-six.\n\nOnce you unlock your Ultimate n, you will want to look for more opportunities to land your g on the enemy.

Now Kennen will just have to rely on flanks and the fog of war to set up a good fight.\n\nLate game team fights are often decided in the neutral objective pits while taking an objective.

While she can dish out a lot of damage at levels 1 and 2, she becomes much stronger when she has access to her basic abilities.\n\nThe next major power spike for Cassiopeia\u2019s is when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Her Ultimate R is very versatile and can be used to either engage or disengage from a fight. It can also be used to set up her Jungler.\n\nCassiopeia\u2019s will start to do a lot more damage in trades when they\u2019ve picked up their first item. Landing one Q and then following that up with multiple E\u2019s should give you a severe health advantage."}

This combined with his Passive and Summoner Spells may easily get him a kill on a squishy target.\n\nReally good wave clear with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This causes him to gain priority really fast and it also helps him secure objectives with his Jungler.\n\nPost-six, he can practically one shot an enemy with his combo while simultaneously re-positioning with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to evade ganks with ease."}
{"text": "As viego, Viego's ganks are quite powerful early. It really shines when it comes to overstretched enemies during the early game. His W and E should help him a lot. Level 6 is a massive peak of power because it allows him to escape from the sloppy battles and use it aggressively when necessary. It also will facilitate him to take over the enemy champions. Viego has a very great objective control because his abilities do a lot of damage and he can melt through them very quickly. He should try to gank his bot track, get the enemy to remember, and then ask for help trying to kill the neutral objective."}
{"text": "As ahri, When Ahri reaches level 11, she will have 2 points in her Ultimate. This offers her additional selection potential during the middle of the game. At level 9, Ahri will maximize her Q. She will be able to easily push the wave of minions during this stage of the game. Mix this with the elements she takes in advance, she can constantly keep the enemy pushed in their turn. Since Ahri is a brilliant Assassin Mage, when several elements are finished, she will be able to secure peaks on sketched targets throughout the middle of the game: leading to a possible neutral objective advantage."}

{"text": "Against camille, Try to stay closely together as a team when she plays against Camille so that it is very difficult for her to engage. Camille will want to lock an isolated target with her Ultimate R, but by standing close to him, this will reduce her ability to do so. Camille will often hunt vulnerable targets that are isolated by walking around the map. Stay with your team to reduce Camille's assassination attempts. In addition to regrouping closely, Camille cannot easily run back to the enemy. Instead, she will try to flank the side."}

Expect him to gank overextended lanes whenever he is level 6.\n \nAlways keep an eye on what items he\u2019s buying. Gragas can go tank or can build a lot of AP. If he\u2019s going AP, respect his damage output.\n \nWhenever Gragas has his E up, he is a bigger threat and you need to position and play safely.

Riven won't be able to do much as her entire kit is based on mobility.\n\nYou will want to take her down as quickly as you can in this matchup. The best thing will be to pick her off before a major fight.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As zoe, Its first component will undoubtedly allow it to inflict more damage in the way and to launch its spells with a higher frequency due to the increase of the mana basin. It will also increase the overall production of damage in a major fight. A RNG component of its pick-up understands the fate that it takes with its W. For example, if it takes an Ignite, it will increase its overall offensive capabilities, while collecting a Locket will increase its team game and its survival."}
{"text": "As swain, Your E and W will be crucial enough to win this track. Try to land it when the enemy is about to hit a minion. You will want to be part of as many skirmishes as possible. That's because your AoE abilities will completely disassemble the enemy team. Your Ultimate R will help you a lot during this phase of the game. Try to use it if you feel you're about to be ruined or all-in'd."}
{"text": "As karthus, Powerfarm in the middle of the game. You have to win as much gold and XP as possible so you can level up quickly. Try to secure goals like Baron and Dragon. Karthus can take goals quickly thanks to its 1 and e. Look for choices with your n and your Ultimate e. Catching someone with your n is a great way to get the advantage of numbers while you can use your Ultimate e to choose low-health enemies."}
{"text": "As ahri, Ahri is quite vulnerable when her Ultimate is down. Play safer and avoid engaging aggressive games while he's on cooldown. Ahri has several assists that makes her a little bit harder than many champions. Moreover, her hitbox E is not the biggest, so it can be difficult to land. Ahri can be difficult to play in team compositions with heavy CC. Although she has tools to help avoid these abilities, she will be limited to how and when she can use her Ultimate. For example, she may have to wait for the enemy to use their CC tool before using her E aggressively."}
{"text": "Against zac, Zac really has long periods of cooling on his engagement abilities. Therefore, he can really use them as a tool of engagement or escape only once in a fight. If you know that he is without these abilities- try to fight him. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the pre-6 card. This will make it harder to jump with his E and should increase your overall survival in the way. Zac has really good roaming potential."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes lots of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You need to play her a lot to make use of her kit.\n\nAs she is mechanically difficult, it\u2019s really easy to go wrong on her. If you make a mistake, the enemy can easily capitalise on it and gain a lead. Once Camille is behind, it will be difficult for her to get back into the game.\n\nYou need to be incredibly proactive on Camille to get ahead. If you auto-pilot or do not use your Ultimate R whenever it\u2019s off cooldown, you\u2019re losing out on potential kills.\n"}
{"text": "As ziggs, As Ziggs gets more items, it will cause a lot of chaos in terms of damage. This means that Ziggs can easily fight against enemies to make the team massively unfair for the enemy. Once Ziggs gets three points in his Ultimate R, it will inflict massive amounts of damage in a huge area during team and goal fighting. Fighting in the nested areas will give Ziggs a huge advantage too, especially when he comes to Dragon and Baron fights. Ziggs is good enough to take turns quickly, but as he gets more items, he will completely decimate them with his passive self-attacks. After that, he can just cut the building with his W, which means that the enemy can't do anything to defend their turn."}
{"text": "As talon, If Talon falls behind he isn't going to one-shot the enemy. Make sure you get as much gold and XP in the early game to make your late game more impactful.\n\nIf your allies do not have any follow up damage or CC, it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to help their lane by roaming.\n\nOnce the enemy starts to group, you will find it harder to pick enemies off and further your lead."}
{"text": "As brand, If this is not possible, he should kite the camp around well enough to make sure that he takes small amounts of damage. By unlocking all his basic abilities, Brand should start ruining over-stretched tracks whenever a chance arises. He will want to get an early advance to bring down a lot of damage in the fights at the end of the game. Once Brand gets his ultimate R, he should take part in other fights, mainly neutral objective fights. He should try to take fights around the choking points and use his ultimate R on congested enemies."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin is one of the funniest junglers in the game. He has a crazy choice rate, and basically all players like Lee Sin. He can win the early game alone through early ganks.

{"text": "As chogath, Cho\u2019Gath can easily get kited by ADCs and champions with dashes in team fights. This makes it hard for him to catch out mobile champions.\n\nIf you can\u2019t hit your e or m on a target when fighting them alone, you\u2019re pretty much always going to lose the skirmish as you need to land these abilities to interrupt the enemy.\n\nWhen you\u2019re behind, it\u2019s really hard for you to get back into the game as the enemy can invade you over and over again."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Depending on its construction path, Poppy's power peaks will change as its AD construction and tank have different power peaks. Once Poppy reaches level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate R, it will have much more utility and will be able to disengage from a skirmish. The more the game goes, the Poppy tank will become. Try and reduce its gold income by refusing its farm in the beginning and middle of the game."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, Qiyana's team combat presence is huge. Disperse yourself and don't fight in bottlenecks like in the jungle or under a lap to reduce its usefulness. The thrust in Split could be a good way to counter Qiyanas R, but make sure that the players who are facing it don't get caught by her R as she usually will use it to start the team fight."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Her Ultimate R is game-changing. If she gets one good Ultimate R off, it could win her team the game. In particular, if she is able to fight inside the jungle, she should easily get a good Ultimate R off.\n\nHas lots of mobility which can allow her to get on to enemies quickly or escape horrible sticky situations.\n\nFinally, Qiyana has a lot of burst damage thanks to her Q. This means she can one-shot enemies in the late game in one combo."}
{"text": "As quinn, Investing in early armor will be very beneficial against his basic attacks in the laning phase. Your level 6 power peak is much stronger than his, not be afraid to play aggressive when you get the higher level. Pre-6, keep the wave closer to your side of the map. It will prevent Quinn from zoned you away from the farm and will allow you to play aggressive and look for killers."}
{"text": "As vladimir, Scales up like a monster, especially if he manages to get a few kills early on. Can single-handedly snowball a game and win it for his team due to the sheer amount of healing.\n\nHis l allows him to get out of sticky situations quite easily while also dismantling ganks from the enemy team, thereby wasting the enemy ganker\u2019s time,\n\nCan destroy the enemy team whenever they are grouped due to his Ultimate e and E. Close quarter fighting is a massive strength for him."}
{"text": "Against sett, Avoid regrouping closely as this can allow Sett to get a multi-person E that will help his team win the team fight. Slightly split up will be better for you in the long run. Don't walk too far in setting a goal as Sett can use his Ultimate R to take the closest champion and throw them into their allies behind them. If you are grouped together and online with each other, it will be harder for him to do it. When there is no team fight, Sett will set himself in a side lane and try to divide the thrust. When he is alone, you could look for him or start a team fight with his allies when he is unable to help them."}
{"text": "Against naafiri, The scope of the abuse and the poke capabilities to get its bottom so it can't go for all-in or look for favorable trades. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early to limit its all-in potential. If it hits you with its Q, step back so it doesn't go for a tracking trade that its damage production will be high."}
{"text": "As gnar, With his varied poke and Q, he can continue to chip on his opponent while they try to close, and force them out of the way. His E allows him to disengage and ruin all the attempts on him of the enemy team. This makes it very difficult for the enemy Jungler to spoil him unless the top lane is able to land their CC on him. His Ultimate R can change the tide of an entire fight. When combined with his E, he can pretty easily CC all the enemy team when they are stuck together."}
{"text": "As veigar, At this stage of the game, you want to put yourself in a side lane and focus on getting stacks so you have a stronger late game.\n\nIn the later parts of the mid-game and when the enemy starts to group, make sure you follow suit and start to group with your team.\n\nLook for picks with your n.

It is vital for the late game.\n\nNot showing up to neutral, objective fights will be a cardinal sin that you want to avoid. All your abilities make it very hard for the enemy team to be concentrated near the pit, hence use it to your advantage.\n\nIf the enemy happens to be too mobile or CC-heavy, just get a defensive item like a Zhonya's Hourglass. It will keep you safe from getting one shot before being able to do anything.        "}
{"text": "As qiyana, Level 16 is perfect for Qiyana as her Ultimate R will be maxed out. She will be dishing out way too much damage for the enemy squishies to handle, and that too very frequently.\n\nHer Ultimate R is superb during team fights. She can immediately turn the tide of a battle with a well-placed Ultimate R and help her allies secure crucial objectives during this phase.\n\nShe will pretty much be full build during this phase of the game. This means that her damage output will be phenomenal. She can dismantle an enemy team by securing picks before a significant fight."}
{"text": "Against karma, After it has a few levels behind it and a few points in Q, it will be able to push the wave and keep you pushed in with ease. Make sure you stop it from getting turn plates by matching its clear wave. Karma has a powerful early game and is strong enough from levels 1 to 3. Try not to let her too much by hiding between the minion wave and recoiling when she advances. Remember that Karma has her Ultimate has at level 1 and can dry a lot of damage if you are hit by her self-nomised Q."}
{"text": "As annie, Try and aim your abilities so they hit her and the minion wave simultaneously. \n\nThis matchup is easy early, but post 6 it is going to be harder as Annia has more kill pressure post 6 with her Ultimate. Keep this in mind.\n\nWhen fighting Annie, avoid fighting her when she has multiple stacks on her Passive. Fight her after she has used her CC tool.\n\nEarly on, keep the wave closer to your side of the map. It will protect you from ganks and reduce Annie\u2019s chances of setting up her Jungler."}
{"text": "Against nocturne, Nocturne is good in extended trades when against a Mage Mid laner. Avoid going for extended auto-attack trades as he\u2019ll always come out ahead.\n\nOnce he hits level 6, Nocturne can use his Ultimate a to assassinate you or any targets if he chooses to roam. Avoid overextending if he\u2019s stronger than you at level 6.\n\nNocturne is a good assassin and will try to kill any isolated target whose out of position in the mid and late game. Avoid letting him pick up free kills by staying as a team."}
{"text": "As leona, Level 2 is a massive powerspike for Leona. This is because her main all-in combo is unlocked at that point, and it deals a lot of damage due to her Passive, provided she has follow-up from her ADC.\n\nHer level 6 is another significant power spike in this lane. The Ultimate e is on a very small cooldown, and the range is quite massive. This allows her to set up her CC chain quite easily.\n\nBoots are arguably one of the most important early game purchases for Leona. This unlocks her roaming potential, and she can terrorize other laners just by roaming around."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Level 6 is a significant spike for Mordekaiser as he can convert a fight to a 1 v 1. It becomes straightforward for Mordekaiser to kill his target.\n\nThe first item component will allow Mordekaiser to survive and deal a lot of damage. The clears will be quick, and his ganks will be pretty solid now.\n\nHis early game ganks are really good due to his abilities. He should be pretty comfortable ganking lanes with heavy CC as they will let him get massive leads.        "}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo gets a huge power spike at level 6. He can now focus on poking the enemy with his r tornado and then use his Ultimate R to finish the low health target off. The lane brushes should help significantly when it comes to landing this ability. \n\nYasuo will gain a small spike whenever he puts an additional point in his r. It improves his r poke damage, which allows him to look for all-ins once he hits level 6. The best time to go for an all-in is when the enemy's primary form of CC is down.\n\nOnce Yasuo gets his first item component, he will get a significant boost in his dueling potential. This means that he can easily catch up to and kill any over-extended or immobile target. He can also help his Jungler during ganks with his E dash and r knockup."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Avoid going for prolonged jobs in this matchup as they will usually win them. Your level 6 is much stronger than the Theres, but his poke intensifyes post 6. Focus on poking and limit fights early on. Wait for you to have some items so you can match their automatic attack damage. Keep the wave closer to your side of the map early on. It will help keep you safe, and they are still and you can capitalize on it with your Jungler."}
{"text": "Against ivern, As Ivern will be building utility items to help his team, looking for picks before a team fight occurs will severely reduce Ivern\u2019s team fight potential.\n \nIvern will use his Bushes W to scout vision for his team. If a bush has been placed nearby- put two and two together and expect that Ivern is in the vicinity.\n \nTry and lock Ivern down with CC as quickly as you can. He is pretty immobile and focusing him first will prevent him from being able to heal and shield his allies with his W. "}
{"text": "As soraka, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As shaco, It is not only a physical threat, but the mental war it instills on the enemy squishies allows Shaco to make multiple pieces that other Champions cannot make. It can leave the way and wander easily enough to get a cheese gank (even if it is laning). Its x can allow it to disengage as well as surprise all-in champions easily. It also acts as a counter to wear which have dashes and rely on kitting to win fights. Its e allows it to get out of sticky situations with ease."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Look for short burst trades in this matchup as much as you can. What you want to do is keep harassing enemies from the lane brush, go in and then fall back once they are knocked up.\n\nYou should have a really easy lane provided you can keep the river warded. It will keep you safe from ganks and will allow you to play the lane on your terms.\n\nRemember that your dash is your only means of escape and engage. Using it at an improper time can get you killed quickly and lose you a major fight."}
{"text": "Against vayne, If Vayne ever uses her e, use the cooldown to play aggressive and try to kill her. She is rather vulnerable when her e is down.\n\nAvoid extended trades with Vayne as her s will deal extra damage to you. Only commit to trades if you\u2019re 100% sure you\u2019re going to win them.\n\nOne way of abusing Vayne\u2019s weak early game is by forcing her to overextend for farm and then calling your Jungler to kill her. Alternatively, you can push her in and take tower plates to gain a gold lead."}
{"text": "As swain, Very immobile and is weak during the early laning phase. This is especially true if he is facing a champion who can all-in and CC him.\n\nIs quite vulnerable when his E is down as it is his main form of CC. \n\nGrievous wounds can completely counter his kit during the early game and also affect his mid-game. He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he won\u2019t have the amplified healing and AoE damage."}
{"text": "As lissandra, After your bot path has moved to the middle track, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. When no team fight occurs, go to a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done. As you are good for getting peaks and killing isolated targets, try to lure and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, call for a nearby goal."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 11 is not a massive peak because it only gives a slight increase in capacity damage. That being said, the lower cooling certainly helps. Pantheon is quite decent during the middle of the game. That's because it can dry a lot of damage in a short time and can secure peaks all around the map. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This means that it can inflict a massive amount of burst damage to any enemy that it gets too close."}
{"text": "As udyr, Udyr's objective control is excellent as he can run around the map quickly and get from one objective to another in a jiffy. This also makes him quite valuable for ganks and counter-ganks.\n\nUdyr's early game ganks are phenomenal and scary. He should be able to run down immobile enemies who are overextended in the lane.\n\nSince he has his Ultimate R from the beginning, his level 6 won't be as lucrative as other champions. Even then, he poses a massive threat to his enemies.        "}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm needs to make sure that he activates his E mid-fight. Activating it too late is useless because the enemy will disengage, and you will waste the shield. It is very motionless, which means that it is really easy to pursue even with his W up. If the enemy freezes the way, he can do nothing to escape an all-in-one. As Tahm Kench is a champion of melee, the laning against various champions is very difficult for him because they can trap him whenever he moves or positions himself a little aggressively."}
{"text": "As zyra, Zyra\u2019s early game poke is very good. Once you have a few levels behind you, you\u2019ll be able to constantly harass the enemy with your Q and E. Gaining an early health lead could set up your Jungler or could allow you to get an early kill.\n\nOnce Zyra has upgraded her Boots, her mobility and damage output will increase. Zyra should get Boots and upgrade them as quickly as possible to increase her damage output.\n\nAt level 6, Zyra\u2019s damage output and kill pressure further intensify. Play around your Ultimate R to look for aggressive plays with your ADC. Your Ultimate R will deal a considerable amount of damage, so you should be able to get kills with it easily."}
{"text": "As lux, Lux will now have his core of articles and will be injured like a truck due to his AP ratios. Any squishy who gets caught by his g will certainly end up dying. She will peak very hard at level 11. This is mainly due to his Ultimate n upgrade, which will increase the damage of this ability while drastically reducing his cooldown. Lux is usually good during team fighting, but she will excel during fighting in the bottlenecks. The enemy will not be able to do anything to avoid Lux's g and will be zoned by his poke."}
{"text": "Against kled, Keep in mind that Kled will try to play super aggressive in the early game to get a kill. Stay at max distance and avoid overextending if you\u2019re weak early game laner.\n\nWhen duelling Kled, keep an eye on his secondary bar. If it\u2019s almost full, he will mount during the skirmish and he\u2019ll be able to kill you. Avoid going for extended duels when he is about to remount. \n\nTry and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make his all-in less effective. Neither will he be able to chase you down with his Ultimate R once you walk up to farm."}
{"text": "As azir, The early game should be focused on farming. The main goal is to get your first item quickly while making sure you don't get CC'd and all-in'd. Use your W and r with the utmost discretion.\n\nShove the wave when possible and punish the enemy laner with your soldier-directed auto-attacks. It will slowly allow you to get a healthy lead in the lane after which you can either look to all-in or roam.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to do a lot more in this lane. The plan is still the same, whittle down your enemy first, and then look to all-in with your Ultimate R. Take the position of the enemy Jungler into account first."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce doesn't really spike at level 6 due to his Ultimate G from level one. This also means that he has access to three more ability variations than his opponent. He should use them to get a lead pre-6.\n\nJayce is weak early on and does rely on his w > s combo to poke enemies out before going for a kill. This will allow him to garner a lead and burst the enemy down once they are low enough.\n\nThe first component will give a damage boost to Jayce and will let him play more aggressively. It will allow Jayce to go for frequent burst trades after poking the enemy out with his w > s combo."}
{"text": "As volibear, The third point in his Ultimate R will make Volibear almost unkillable in significant fights. It will also let him get easy team fight wins in choke points.\n\nVolibear is going to be really tanky during this phase of the game. He can serve as both an engager and a peeler for his team, depending on what his team needs the most at this point.\n\nVolibear's pick potential is really high during the mid and late game. This is due to the shorter cooldown of his Ultimate R. He should always try to kill enemies who have been caught off guard."}
{"text": "As nunu, Really good Objective control due to his Q and Smite. It also allows him to heal up both in the lane and in the Jungle, which provides him an innate advantage against other Junglers.\n\nGreat ganking potential due to his W, especially if there is no vision set-up by the enemy team. This can lead to a great CC chain.\n\nHis Ultimate R can allow him to set-up phenomenal death brushes while contesting objectives. This can allow him to end the game or take the objective quite freely."}
{"text": "As twitch, His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will dramatically increase his damage and leave his squishies at one stroke if they take many automatic attacks from Twitch. Once he has 2 points in his Ultimate c, he will easily be able to resume team fighting and disrupt them as well. His positioning will be very important."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Watch your positioning at all times so she cannot land crucial spells on you.\n\nHer level 6 is much stronger than yours. Disengage if she clicks R.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to force her to over extend for farm.\n\nTry to match her pushing power though, as you don\u2019t want her to gain a gold lead by getting early turret plates.\n"}
{"text": "Against zac, His early game is rather weak but killing him can be difficult. Expect him to focus on farming rather than fighting in the very early game. \n\nZac is really good in team fights as his kit has tons of CC. Try to disengage whenever he E\u2019s in to make it harder for him to get a good knockup.\n\nOnce Zac hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his kill pressure increases. Expect him to either play aggressive and go for a kill or expect him to set up his Jungler for a gank."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, Ward your flanks as Mordekaiser may try to attack from the side in order to get on a high valued target with his Ultimate R.\n\nIf Mordekaiser misses his E in a team fight, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad time to focus him down as he will be unable to pull your team in when his E is on cooldown.\n\nAvoid starting major objectives like the Baron or a Dragon when Mordekaiser is nearby as he can take your Jungler into the Shadow Realm with his R which will make taking the objective risky."}
{"text": "As varus, At level 11, Varus will be able to add 2 points into his Ultimate R. This makes it really easy for Varus to pick off enemies, especially when Varus is trying to swap lanes.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will allow him to deal a lot of damage to his opponents in the lane. It will also provide him the incentive to carry for his team if he is already ahead.\n\nVarus' AoE poke and Ultimate R make clumped fights disastrous for the enemy team. They will suffer if Varus manages to get an excellent Ultimate R during neutral, objective fights.        "}
{"text": "As graves, Group with your allies. Do not leave their side in the late game otherwise the enemy will have the numbers advantage.\n\nBe prepared to peel for your allies in team fights.

You have good follow up damage, so look for plays with your allies to gain the numbers advantage."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, At level 9, Aurelion will maximize its 1st ability. It is a very good peak of power for it because it will allow it to flatten more damage, and clear waves more easily. In the middle of the match, Aurelion Sol should have completed several elements. It should be able to flatten a lot of damage in team fighting with its Ultimate and Passive. Level 11 is another good peak of power for Aurelion Sol because it gets to put a second point in its Ultimate."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Its level 2 is quite an essential powerpike as it can now look for all-in and knockup enemies with ease. The use of track brushes for this purpose only amplifies the effect. Level 6 is another important power peak as it allows Jarvan to add another layer to its all-in combo. It can also separate someone from their team and can easily choose targets. Jarvan is quite oppressive in the track. Its all-out threat is sufficient to keep enemies at hand, and keeping track brushes down will allow Jarvan to catch the out-of-guard enemy with ease."}
{"text": "As sivir, At level 6, Sivir's potential increases. Avoid overvoltage without a vision post 6. Stay away as far as you can from the minion wave. This will limit the power it has. Try to keep the wave closer to your side of the map, or even (without vision). It has good all-in-all potential and you are completely motionless and subject to all in. Limit the automatic attack jobs. Focus on the pose and do not take any damage in return. It will normally win automatic attack fights with you."}
{"text": "As sett, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}

Do not go for an extended trade unless the enemy's primary ability is on cooldown.\n\nIf you manage to shove the wave in, try to roam with your W. If it so happens that the enemy side laners are low, you can quickly E in and get some kills.\n\nYour Ultimate will help you a lot in this game but make sure that you position correctly.

{"text": "As sett, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate R is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As akshan, Putting the third and final point in Akshans Ultimate at level 16 is really beneficial to him. In the late part, depending on his articles, he may be able to pay tons of damage to a squishy target. At level 13, Akshan goes max on his E. The extra mobility is very powerful in the later stages of the game. Once again, as the teams regroup in the late part, if he can get the closure on a marked enemy, he can bring back an ally to life that could turn the tide of the game."}
{"text": "As zilean, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in lane.

Once they\u2019re low enough, you can commit to an all-in.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve hit level 6 and purchased key component items, look to harass and constantly push the enemy into their tower.

{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas gets to level 16, he will have his Ultimate R maxed out. It will give him a massive damage boost, and the low cooldown combined with the knockback will help him pick high-priority targets.\n\nGragas will either be highly tanky or a glass cannon dependent on landing his combo depending on the build. As a Jungler, Gragas will mostly be the latter, so his main goal will be to blow up the enemy backline when he gets the chance.\n\nHis dash and Ultimate R make up for a significant amount of peel for his carries. Should he go for the tank build route, he will successfully absorb a lot of damage for his team while his team follows up on Gragas' engagement."}
{"text": "As udyr, Quite strong duelist during the early match and can 1 v 1 any Jungler opponent with ease. Duel power increases considerably if he has his Red Buff. Really good Objective control due to his quick card movements and camp-taking abilities. He can take early Dragons quite easily, especially if the enemy team has no form of vision on it. His potential of choice during the middle of the match is quite massive. He can work with his Support and E to get some free dead and snowball his lead."}
{"text": "As bard, Once you reach this stage, you should focus more on roaming and the impact of the map with your Ultimate R & E. When you keep in depth, make sure to keep your E ready to escape any sticky situation. Before leaving your track, drop some W shrines here and there. This will help your ADC stay healthy, especially when they are against a poke track. Always try to lure enemy travellers to push and use the wall behind them to E and then stun them with your Q. The association with your Jungler/other travelers will give maximum efficiency and enemies generally do not plan such coins."}
{"text": "As swain, His tankness and damage are really high during this phase of the game. He can also use his Zhonya Hurglass to be impassable for one while inflicting damage all the time. A maximum-out Ultimate R will allow him to survive the fights with ease. The damage will be pretty devastating for the enemy team as well. Swain's late match is strong due to his prowess fighting team. He can immediately kill the enemy team if he manages to catch them near a choke point."}
{"text": "Against karthus, If you see Karthus using his Ultimate e at the beginning of the fight, try the CC to cancel his Ultimate e. If you kill Karthus at the beginning of the fight, try to reposition and move away from his Passive. This will reduce his damage exit and make the survival of the team fight easier. If you spot Karthus in a side track pushed by division, you can start a team fight. But, you must keep in mind that he can influence the existing fight with his Ultimate e."}
{"text": "As soraka, Try to follow Soraka's ultimate cooldown post 6. It's important to do so because you don't want to be caught by Soraka's top damage pole 6. Make sure that the minion wave is positioned closer to your side of the map so that your Jungler can gank your way and easily kill Soraka. Your Ultimate makes you strong. Every time it goes up, try to use it! You can increase your chances of winning by playing smart and around your Ultimate. Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. It will allow you to everything in Soraka and continue them in the way. If you push, you will never be able to engage, and you will not be killed in this matchup."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Level 11 is not a massive spike like other Supports. It gives only a measly increase in the damage and no utility, unlike other Supports. That being said, the lower cooldown certainly helps.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This means he can deal a massive amount of burst damage to any enemy he gets too close to.\n\nPantheon is quite potent during the mid-game. This is because he can dish out a lot of damage in a short time and can secure picks all around the map.        "}
{"text": "As nocturne, Nocturne is a great assassin who can come out on anyone who walks alone around the card. This makes his potential of choice incredibly high. Has a quick and healthy clear. This makes him a Jungler who can hold their own and farm a storm and get their article and level power spikes relatively fast. Nocturne is easy to learn and does not take hundreds of games to learn like some champions in the game."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille is a mechanically difficult champion. She takes a lot of practice to master and she has a sharp learning curve. You need to play her a lot to make use of her kit. As it is mechanically difficult, it is really easy to get wrong on her. If you make a mistake, the enemy can easily capitalize on her and win an advance. Once Camille is behind it, it will be difficult for her to get back into the game. You have to be incredibly proactive on Camille to move forward. If you automatically pilot or not use your Ultimate R every time he is out cooldown, you lose on potential murders."}
{"text": "As akali, Abuse your range advantage as much as possible.\n\nKeep her pushed in early on so she is unable to roam.\n\nTry and always keep your spacing versus her. Only w forward if she misses E.\n\nLook for an all-in at level 2 with your W.\n"}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao will have two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. It will allow him to use the ability more often, making it easier for him to convert fights into a 1 v 1 as and when required.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out by the time he hits level 9. This is a crucial power spike as it massively increases his damage output and dueling capacity.\n\nXin is excellent in team fights and picking of enemies due to his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to single out enemies, allowing him to be immune from ranged carries.        "}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Watch your positioning in late game team fights. Stay as safe as possible so you do not get killed first. Cassiopeia is one of the strongest late game champions, so staying alive is key.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook to initiate and start a fight with your Ultimate R. Being able to land a multi-person stun will make the fight much easier for your team."}
{"text": "Against karthus, If you see Karthus channelling his e, try to cancel it with any CC abilities. This will reduce his and his allies chances of getting kills. \n\nKarthus will be looking to farm as much as possible early so he can unlock his Ultimate {{championSpells.KarthusFallenOne}. Try to put him behind by playing aggressive and requesting ganks.\n\nAs soon as Karthus hits level 6, communicate with your team so they know he can impact fights with his Ultimate e. Ping as soon as he is level 6."}
{"text": "As yasuo, You're really good at getting picks and killing isolated targets. Try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective.\n\nFlanking is your friend during this game. Use your r tornado and the fog of war to get knock-ups on careless enemies and then kill them quickly.\n\nYou should be sitting in a side lane during this phase of the game. It allows you to chase down enemies and will let you efficiently farm and scale up.        "}
{"text": "As shyvana, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game. Getting them and securing the Dragon Soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nLook for picks with your team. If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "As neeko, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss out on extra damage and CC.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Gangplank's Ultimate R will be a force to reckon with now as it will have multiple upgrades and will give added benefits to him. This will increase his team fighting strength by a lot.\n\nNow he will have three points in his Ultimate R. With the reduced cooldown and the damage, Gangplank will be able to take over the game effortlessly.\n\nThis is the point of the game where Gangplank becomes really scary. He has a truckload of items, his barrels can legitimately one-shot someone, and he can effortlessly chase people down with his Ultimate R. The enemies will have no other option than to walk the plank at this stage."}
{"text": "As irelia, In the last game, continue to divide the push if your team is not at risk of dying or getting caught. If your team is going to get caught or if the game is not one way, you have to group with your team to help them fight. Play on the side of the card that has the next major goal up so that you can turn to take it with your team. Otherwise, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the card and use it to get it to your team."}
{"text": "As soraka, Can sustain both herself as well as the friendly laner throughout the laning phase. Her Q empowered W provides a lot of healing as well.\n\nHer E is very advantageous in grouped fights. It can send the enemy team into disarray and forces them to play defensively. \n\nHer Ultimate R allows her to impact any fight on the map with ease. This allows her to change the results of skirmishes and duels throughout the game."}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, Always make sure behind a minion so it is harder for him to land his Q. If he is able to land his Q, he can look for a fight. As soon as Tahm Kench activates his Grey Health E, disengage from the fight because he will offer him protection and you may be unable to kill him through the health bonus. Tahm Kench is quite still. If you can, try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will force him to overextend for the farm, which may allow you to hunt him, or set up your Jungler to kill him."}
{"text": "Against nidalee, Nidalee is an early game dominant Jungler. Ward her jungle entrances to spot her leaving her jungle to make ganking harder for her. \n\nDeeper wards are preferred against Nidalee as she can use her k to jump over walls and manoeuvre around commonly warded bushes. Keep this in mind when placing wards. \n\nNidalee is easy to kill if the enemy Jungler hasn\u2019t been kiting camps correctly. Try and invade and kill her early on as she doesn\u2019t always have a healthy clear."}
{"text": "As lulu, Focus on the enemy of the range and use your Q to slow down if they try to fly and catch up to you. It will allow you to scale and intimidate your opponent unabated. Do not push too far in this path without putting the right vision around. Junglers will certainly try to gank you because of your immobility. You can play more liberally once you get your Ultimate R. It will also allow you to lure enemies into diving when you are weak in health. Combined with your W, you can quickly secure the murders."}
{"text": "Against yorick, Before a team fight, try to choose his Maiden from the Mist R. You'll want this dead beast before a fight happens because it inflicts a ton of damage and it will do any fight looks like a 5v6. Yorick has a high healing with his Q and R wounds. Grievous will reduce the said healing and make it less powerful. Yorick will look for an E W engage on one of your team members."}
{"text": "As pyke, If you miss your Ultimate R, you\u2019re going to miss out on the potential resets and you\u2019ll definitely miss out on gold and damage. Try your hardest to know who has Flash and who doesn\u2019t to increase your chances of landing your Q.\n\nHe is a mechanically difficult champion to learn and will take a lot of getting used to. Expect to put in a lot of work trying to learn him.\n\nUnfortunately, Pyke has nothing to offer when his Q is down. Missing this ability will be devastating and you\u2019ll have to play safe until it\u2019s back up. Try to get as close to the enemy or bait out any dashes before using your Q."}
{"text": "As taliyah, It is an agricultural matchup. Focus on agriculture and just harass with your abilities. Stand outside the minion wave at all times. They will try to push, and by standing out of the wave, you force them to choose between using mana on the wave or you. Investing in early boots can help you avoid their skill strokes and make the laning phase less stressful. Be prepared to sacrifice CS for XP and health."}
{"text": "As kled, The all-in potential with his E and Q is really strong. It also allows him to set-up ganks for his Jungler and get free kills in the lane.\n\nKled\u2019s Passive is one of his greatest powers in a full-blown skirmish. He can use it to instigate tower dives and soak tower shots, while if he happens to take a lot of damage and get dismounted, he can easily get Skaarl back.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to initiate a team fight with ease. It can be used as an ability to score picks on immobile champions as well. The team movement speed increase makes sure that he generally gets sufficient follow-up."}
{"text": "As kayle, Kayle is weak early on; hence she will have to depend on her Q for most of her poke and farming in the lane. This is the phase that needs to be played very carefully by Kayle.\n\nHer level six is a massive power spike due to her ranged auto-attacks. This will allow her to play more liberally and let her play the lane more safely.\n\nKayle's first item will help her a lot with trading and farming. This is really helpful for her and will help her scale up quickly from now on.        "}
{"text": "Against nami, Nami is quite deadly. Don't let her intimidate you to level 1 so it's harder for her to look for level 2 all-in. Once Nami reaches level 6, her death pressure is intensifies as her Ultimate R is an excellent tool to start skirmishes or disengage from fighting. Make sure you have the vision in your way as she can use her Ultimate R to set up her Jungler. Nami is very good when she has 1 or more basic healing elements because she will be able to support and heal her allies to complete health quickly. Try to put her behind in the early game to deny these power peaks."}
{"text": "As nautilus, On getting 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will use the ability quite often. Team fights will be a breeze for him from now on.\n\nHis ability to make the team fights unfair due to his pick potential will be quite apparent during this game phase. All he needs to do is Ultimate e his enemy from out of vision.\n\nHis tankiness will know no bounds during this phase of the game. He will soak up both tower shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow up on his engagement."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao is incredibly strong at the beginning of the game thanks to his E and Q. He will win the largest number as long as he looks for favorable jobs around abilities.

{"text": "As yasuo, Try and force him to over extend for farm by keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will also protect you from all-ins.\n\nTry and abuse your range advantage, especially in the early levels. He is melee, so keep harassing him as much as possible.\n\nStand away from minions and keep your distance while harassing to reduce his chances of all-ining you.\n\nAt level 6, you need to be more careful when fighting him. Continue to keep your distance, but be prepared to Flash or E away so he cannot knock you up and kill you.\n"}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin will try to gank as often as he can in the early game. He is a strong duelist and will seek to abuse his early play force. Once Lee Sin is level 6, his pressure to kill increases as his Ultimate k can be used to set up ganks or finish enemies. He is very strong at level 6. As soon as Lee Sin has finished his juggling element, his death pressure will be very high because it will have lower cooling and more damage."}
{"text": "As syndra, Its R, E combo can CC an entire enemy team if they are grouped. This can also be used to select high priority targets. Its E is a multipotent capacity that can keep it safe even when it pushes upwards. With a good guard and this ability, it is quite safe in the track."}
{"text": "As drmundo, It's a tank versus tank matchup. Probably avoid fighting it that you're going to waste time. Fight it only if you're 100% sure you're going to get the murder.

Play smart and recall when you\u2019re low so Taric cannot use their Ultimate to execute you.\n\nTry and harass Taric as often as possible with your superior range. Bully them as often as possible and then look for an all-in when they\u2019re low.\n"}
{"text": "Against soraka, Invest in a Calling or Morellonomicon Executers if your champion takes advantage of it. This will reduce the healing potential of Soraka's W and Ultimate R to help you win the team fight. As Soraka will be positioned in the backline, it will be difficult for you to get her down quickly. To kill her more easily, try to flank her side rather than run straight to her in a team fight. Soraka is unable to cope with split thrusts during the middle of the game. If you are able to, you could set yourself in a side lane and force her to challenge your push. Then you could all in her while she is alone."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Tremendous wave clearing potential with a lot of poke built in his kit. His Q alone can force the enemy to recall back to base if they keep getting tagged by it.\n\nCan displace enemy units into his E by using his W.

{"text": "As vayne, You can use track brushes fairly liberally for this purpose. Your n will be your best friend in the way if you're dealing with an early tank. Make sure you spare him from moving away from the enemy if they manage to land their CC on you. Getting your Ultimate n will help you a lot and will allow you to pass through tanks quite easily. Just make sure that your positioning is correct."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Similarly, make sure to use Flash to escape his Ultimate R so that he can't get the reset and win the fight. Ward flanks when siging goals that Pyke can attack on the side or take someone with his Q and win the fight. Lock Pyke with CC as soon as he commits will make it really difficult for him to inflict damage and execute anyone."}
{"text": "As lillia, It must hit level 6 as quickly as possible to make its ganks more efficient. As Lillia is usually built AP, it will fight against teams that have cutting-edge damage. It also fights against poke and disengagement, which can make the team fight difficult for it. Although its Ultimate R is an excellent team combat tool, it takes some time to come into force. Your allies can also disrupt your damage if they inflict damage to a sleeping target."}
{"text": "As zyra, Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. So your goal during the laning phase is to look for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As chogath, Cho\u2019Gath has almost unlimited sustain thanks to his Passive in lane. Just make sure you land the last hit on minions so you get the health back!\n\nHis e has a very large range. This makes it easier for him to land and CC. The only problem is that it can be difficult for him to land it against champions with dashes or escape tools.\n\nCho\u2019Gath is a strong scaler with a versatile build path. This means that he is great in the later stages of the game regardless of how ahead or behind he was in the earlier stages of the game."}
{"text": "As gnar, This is the point of the game where grouped fights become common. This means that Gnar can now decimate the enemy team with proper usage of his Ultimate R.\n\nAt level eleven, he will have two points in his Ultimate R. This is really good as it increases the overall damage dealt by the ability and reduces the general cooldown.\n\nHis Q is his primary poke tool in the lane and in the game. It will be maxed out at level nine, ensuring that he can harass enemies relentlessly and force them to recall abruptly."}
{"text": "As illaoi, During the mid-game, split push and apply pressure to the edges of the map while your team applies pressure elsewhere.\n\nIllaoi is very strong in team fights, so it\u2019s recommended that you find opportunities to group with your team. In particular, you are good around objectives and inside the jungle.\n\nDelay team fights for as long as possible. This will provide time for your Passive to kick in and for you to get some tentacles down."}
{"text": "Against renata, When she hits level 6, she can set up her Jungler to gank your lane and kill you. Keep this in mind post 6.\n\nShe is good in team fights thanks to the large radius on her Ultimate R.\n\nOnce she has completed her Mythic item, her utility, peel and trading potential increases heavily. Expect her to be stronger once she has completed this item."}
{"text": "As malphite, Malphite is a strong Jungler, especially after he reaches level 6 because he can easily gank his allies with his Ultimate h.\n\nMalphite has a very versatile build path. He can either go damage, off damage or full tank, depending on what his team needs.\n\nMalphite\u2019s very good in team fights because he can potentially land a five-person Ultimate h. Knocking up multiple champions could win his team the fight.\n"}
{"text": "As jax, His Q being maxed at level 13 will give him a massive power boost, and he will be able to win duels with ease from now on. Jax should try to split push and duel anyone if he isn't too far behind.\n\nJax's main spike comes when he reaches the late game and has multiple items in his inventory. Now he can actually 1 v 5 against the enemy team and come out on top. He can play a mind game and see if he can catch the enemy carrying farming in the side lane. The brushes in the Jungle are great spots to hide in to achieve this goal.\n\nSince Jax can deal a lot of consistent DPS and is heavily item reliant, he will be mighty once full build. He should get a defensive item, though, as he needs to survive to actually deal the damage."}
{"text": "As nunu, He can absorb a lot of damage and then regenerate a lot of health by using his Q.

{"text": "As kayle, Another point in her Ultimate R will see that she is the most powerful she can be in the game. She can now cut through the enemy team with a good positioning.

Her 3rd empowerment is essential and will make Kayle very powerful."}
{"text": "Against akali, In the team fights, Akali will seek to dive the backline and take out the most squishis champions. As soon as she engages, try to lock it with CC/ peel it away from you and your allies. CC is your biggest friend when it comes to beating her. If Akali engages and is hidden inside her W, step back from the Shroud until it disappears. This will make it much harder for her to fight and survive if she can't hide in it. In the last stages of the game, try to stay in the team and try not to wander the card alone. Akali has a ton of explosion and can easily assassinate squishy targets that walk alone."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Try to finish the game as fast as you can as long as the game goes, the stronger Kayle becomes. Kayle will tend to be split pushing during the middle of the game. You can use this time to force a team to fight with the advantage of numbers as she pushes into a side track. Kayle is rather vulnerable when her Ultimate R is on cooldown. Try to force the fights and kill her while her Ultimate R is on the ground."}
{"text": "As akali, Akali runs out of energy quite easily. You\u2019ll need to keep a constant eye on your energy levels and only go in for aggressive plays when you have lots of energy.\n\nAkali and assassins like her struggle against teams with lots of CC. In team fights, you\u2019ll have to wait for the perfect opportunity to go in so you do not get CC\u2019d and killed pretty much instantly.\n\nAkali is one of the hardest champions to master in the game. Playing around her energy levels, her Passive, her W and her two mobility spells takes a lot of practice. Expect to put in a lot of effort if you want to learn Akali."}
{"text": "As talon, Its level two is the strongest in the whole game and should allow it to accumulate an early advance. It will want to let the wave push towards it during level 1 to maximize the strength of its level 2. Level 6 is a massive power peak for Talon as it increases its damage from the global burst. It also allows it to roll around a lot and kill enemies in the side track without any warning. The first element should allow it to flatten a lot of damage in the track or when it is roaming."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan IV will unlock his d > e combo at level two, which will allow him to catch and surpass the enemies with the greatest ease. This will also allow him to show extreme prowess during Jungle's duels. Jarvan's first element will give him a massive boost to his duel and survival. He will now be able to put his d Passive to good use, especially if he manages to catch an enemy on his own. Jarvan IV will unlock the ability to completely separate an enemy from their team and lock them at level 6. It is incredibly beneficial when the main objective is to separate a single target and get rid of them quickly."}

Respect her all-in and do not push without vision as her Ultimate R.\n \nAfter Camille has completed her jungling item, she will be incredibly strong when skirmishing. Avoid fighting her alone unless you have a clear advantage."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Hecarim is a strong duelist in the early game and will try to solo kill you early on. Do not underestimate his early game damage as he will usually come out ahead.\n\nLook at what Summoner Spells Hecarim has taken. If he\u2019s taken Ignite, he will be looking to play ultra-aggressive early to get kills. If you\u2019re low, do not try and trade with him as he will finish you off with Ignite.\n\nTry and keep trades short and sweet as Hecarim does really well in extended trades thanks to his W which will heal him and his h which is on a low cooldown."}
{"text": "As teemo, It is vulnerable when its t is down, and can be engaged if its speed of movement k is reduced. Its ultimate t can easily be rid by the enemy by buying Control Wards. Enemy Junglers with jumps and dashes can also bypass these mushrooms by taking strange routes. It falls quite drastically during the end of the game and can only resort to split thrust. This puts his team in a disadvantageous state and causes a lot of tension to accumulate within the team."}
{"text": "As skarner, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nFurthermore, your best bet is to invest in an early pen item. They will be building tank items, so you need some pen if you want to kill them.\n\nBrand has good objective control, so prioritise taking those objectives when you can.\n\nHe will be ganking a lot early on. Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As kayn, He is quite versatile and can play around what his team needs. If his team finds himself having a lot of damage, he can go for the Darkin shape and act as a front line for his team. If he takes the form of Assassin, he can easily shoot targets in the enemy backline. With the speed of the E movement, he can quite easily bring them down."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Avoid fighting around objectives as Poppy may use her Ultimate R to knock away the Jungler and cost your team the Baron/ Dragon.\n\nIn team fights, disengage and avoid team fighting in the jungle as it will allow Poppy to get a good knockup with her Ultimate R or pick off a key target with her E.\n\nFighting around Poppy\u2019s Ultimate R is a good way of winning team fights. She will knock back the frontline and then engage on to the carries while the frontline is missing. Try to dodge her Ultimate R, or use CC abilities on her so her channel is interrupted."}
{"text": "As yasuo, The incorrect use of his W can cause him to kill in the way. This is especially true against various matchups. The alternative is to step back, which allows the enemy of just Yasuo area of the wave. Very vulnerable to crowd control because it prevents him from throwing his E for a while. He can't throw E on the same target twice, so he can easily be taken out."}
{"text": "As sion, An additional point in his Ultimate R will increase his overall damage and allow him to use the ability frequently. He will help him massively during team fighting or trying to secure peaks. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be respectable enough now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability by hiding in a brush. His tankness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will absorb the turn shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow his commitments."}
{"text": "As nunu, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting with out it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As teemo, Very squishy and layered crowd control can get rid of him immediately. He is vulnerable when his t is down, and can be engaged upon if his k movement speed is reduced.\n\nHis Ultimate t can easily be gotten rid of by the enemy by purchasing Control Wards. Enemy Junglers with leaps and dashes can also bypass these mushrooms by taking odd routes.\n\nHe falls off quite drastically during the late game and can only resort to split pushing. This puts his team in a disadvantageous state and causes a lot of tension to build up within the team. "}
{"text": "As masteryi, If you want to fight him, you need to bait his Q first or else he'll just win the 1v1. Post 6, don't steal his Ultimate because he won't help you too well in the 1v1 against him. It's an early game stronger Jungler than you. Try to match his pressure in any way possible (flying camps, countering the glove or taking goals)."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Level nine is a massive powerspike for Heimerdinger. He will now have maxed out an ability and will be dishing out a lot of damage depending on his maxed ability. As an ADC, it will probably be his Q, so he will have an easy time wave clearing and defending himself during all-ins.\n\nAdding another point to his Ultimate R will skyrocket his overall power in the lane. Again, this is because the empowerments will be more powerful, and Heimerdinger will use them both offensively and defensively.\n\nHeimerdinger excels during team fights as he can control a large area with his Q turrets. This will be really useful in clumped areas like the objective pits and the Jungle paths."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks Ultimate R is very good in team fights, especially in closed areas as it will allow him to deal damage to tons of champions at once.\n\nFurthermore, in team fights, his W will heal him a lot. The extra sustain/damage will be really beneficial in team fights.\n\nFiddlesticks laning phase is pretty simple. He is also pretty safe in lane. Focus on poking, trading, and not falling behind."}
{"text": "Against ekko, Lock Ekko in the team fights will prevent him from using his Ultimate R to escape with. Keep track of his Ultimate R in the fights as he can use it to set up an escape or engagement. Keep the vision in typical flank locations like Ekko will try to set up an engagement with his W from out of sight. If you see him running towards you, step back for a few seconds as he would have used his W. When no team fights happen, Ekko will try to divide the thrust. Avoid leaving him alone in a side lane by making sure that there is always someone who matches him."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton's first item component will help him massively with his laning. His dueling power should increase quite decently now.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike for Renekton as he gains his Ultimate t now. It will allow him to initiate all-ins and zone the enemy off during neutral, objective fights.\n\nRenekton is quite a solid early game champion. His ability to duel enemies and impact neutral objective fights is massive and should allow his team to dominate during the early game."}
{"text": "Against alistar, Alistar will not hesitate to Flash over walls to start fight. Be sure to ward your flanks when sieging an objective or starting the Baron or Dragon.\n \nAlistar\u2019s Ultimate provides him with a ton of extra defensive stats. In team fights, don\u2019t focus him as it will be very hard for you to kill him. Instead, try to peel back and wait for his Ultimate to end before focusing him down.\n \nAvoid grouping very closely as a team and never stand together inside the jungle. Alistar\u2019s basic t>e combo has a rather large AOE and you may lose the team fight if he can get a multiperson knock up."}
{"text": "As vex, At level 14, Vex will complete the upgrade of its second ability. Again, its release of damage and the global threat will increase. Almost all the champion peaks at level 16 when they put the 3rd point in their Ultimate R. Teams will be grouped in the end of the game. Vex is good in the team fights, so she should do pretty well in the team fights at the end of the game."}
{"text": "As camille, When no team fight happens, go in a side lane and look to divide the thrust. You are strong in a 1v1 and should be able to fight against anyone who tries to stop you. Every time you are divided push, look at what your team does and be ready to move from the side lane to help your team. Flank the enemy with your E to access key targets. Look for choices in the middle of the game with your E or Ultimate R. Catching someone when your team is nearby can easily lead to a murder and possibly a goal after it."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, After level 6, you will need to utilize the brushes and your d to leave him in low health for an all-in with your h.\n\nIf you find yourself in a trade, you need to consider and be aware of his shield bar, and also not commit completely to it until he uses his W, since it can turn the tide of a fight.\n\nPush aggressively and look for trading windows until level 3, then back off and let the wave push back to you. In this time, you should resort to spamming d to deal damage to Mordekaiser.\n\nMordekaiser's weakest point is at level 1 since he doesn't have his abilities and can't stack his Passive reliably, so you can afford to prolong trades with him to a degree."}
{"text": "As vex, Maximizing damage output can be really difficult on Vex, especially when laning against champions with dashes.\n\nEven with her W, she still struggles against some all-in champions.\n\nWhile she has good wave clear, she can get out pushed and out poked by champions with superior range and damage."}
{"text": "As leblanc, Heavy champion of snowball. If Leblanc gets killed or two, she can make the snowball the track and move forward more easily. At a closer gap / ability to escape thanks to her W. This makes her a huge threat in the way and makes her a little safe from the ganks. Leblanc has a good clear wave thanks to her W. This allows her to compete or exceed most of the loans."}
{"text": "As zilean, His Q W Q combo can allow him to stun a group of enemies which is highly beneficial in close-quarter combat. His scalings are quite high as well so he can deal a lot of damage through that combo.\n\nHis Ultimate t, when used properly, is one of the most obnoxious and overpowered abilities in the game. That combined with his p can make one of his carries nearly uncatchable and unkillable.\n\nHis p allows him to guarantee a Q W Q hit on a specified target. This can be highly beneficial in setting a death brush before a major objective fight."}
{"text": "Against darius, If Darius invades you, just run away. He is one of the best duelers in the game, so don\u2019t overstay your welcome.\n\nWhen fighting Darius, try to reposition so his e doesn\u2019t hit you. Moving outside of the ring or towards him will reduce his damage output.\n\nTry and secure objectives and gank your allies as frequently as possible. Darius will be trying to do the same,\n"}
{"text": "As lulu, This champion is quite motionless and is subject to CC. If they get caught by any CC, they will probably die. Lulu relies on her team to carry while she provides them with healings and shields. Lulu is a squishy champion with low points of success. This makes her rather vulnerable and easy to kill."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Look for regular exchanges with your g and e. It should allow you to get away easily without taking a lot of damage in return. Your Ultimate e should help you massively when it comes to dealing with any kind of mobile enemy. Just make a point to commit to an all-in when you use the ability. Roam if possible, especially if one of the enemy travelers is overstretched. It will allow you to get an insurmountable advance and will tilt the enemy team."}
{"text": "As camille, Keep the wave closer to your side of the map to force Camille to overtake for the farm. It is weak early, so you can force her fall in CS to go. Take advantage of your reach advantage to intimidate her and get an early health advance. In particular, she is self-sufficient when your self-authorized is up, and when she climbs up to the last strike. Try and stay in the middle of the track at all times so that it prevents Camille from landing easily on you. Post 6, you should keep the wave closer unless you are in advance."}
{"text": "As milio, Unfortunately, Milio has long cooldowns, especially with his Ultimate. It\u2019s key that he doesn\u2019t waste his abilities or else he will be an easy target.\n\nPositioning can be hard for Milio as he can easily get killed and locked down with CC. If he gets CC\u2019d he cannot use his Ultimate, so it\u2019s important he never gets CC\u2019d.\n\nFurthermore, Milio is quite susceptible to CC. He is quite immobile and squishy, so positioning is key.\n"}
{"text": "As warwick, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make it easier to access the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}
{"text": "As ahri, At level 2, Ahri will have access to both her Q and E. Once she hits this level, she can look for a favourable trade.\n\nAs soon as Ahri hits level 6, her kill pressure and pick potential increases. You can look for kills with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve recalled and picked up your first component item, your Q damage and wave clear will increase dramatically. You will be able to push the enemy into their tower with ease once you have this item."}
{"text": "As nidalee, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies forward. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure to try to exploit your early advantage. Look to secure the goals as often as possible. This will give your team an advantage as the game unfolds. Find a healthy balance between the ganking of your allies, farming your jungle and securing goals. Make sure you don't fall back in XP trying to gank constantly."}
{"text": "As zed, Make sure you're close to your team at all times so you can fight quickly. After your bot track has moved to the medium track, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to close and win XP. As you're good at getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambushed and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Rift Summoners alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby goal."}
{"text": "As lucian, When Lucian reaches level 6, play very carefully. Constantly ward the nearby bushes to not get caught off-guard by Lucian and save up your E when he tries to all-in you.\n\nEzreal outranges Lucian. Use the range advantage to safely farm and to avoid Lucian\u2019s harass with his Q and auto attacks.\n\nLucian has very high burst in the early game. Respect his damage and keep any trades short, by maintaining your distance away from him. Poke him with your Qs and your W.\n\nLucian has a lot of wave push power. Utilize this by freezing the lane near your Tower to expose him to ganks and prevent him from bursting you down."}
{"text": "As lux, Level six is a massive peak of power because it unlocks Lux's 100 to 0 combo. Any enemy who gets caught by its g will be in a world of pain from now on. Its first element will allow it to spam its abilities with a higher frequency, to inflict more damage, and to assert the domination of the way due to its long range. Its early play is not so bright because its damage is not too significant due to any element."}
{"text": "As pantheon, The first element will allow him to inflict more damage and spam his abilities due to the increased mana. Level six is a massive peak due to his ability to get his Ultimate R. This will allow him to play around the card and get his team before. He is really a great starter champion that his damage bursting during the start of the game is phenomenal. Anyone who is still will have problems with him."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Avoid committing to extended trades with the enemy in the very early game. Wait until you have a few levels under your belt before looking to fight.\n\nPlay around your Q hotspots in lane, and avoid using them unless you\u2019re able to trade. When your Q is on cooldown, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and will lose 1v1 fights.\n\nMake sure you make use of your Passive empowered auto. If you\u2019re able to use it periodically on the enemy laner, your chances of winning the lane increases."}
{"text": "Against zilean, Every time he uses his Ultimate t, try to abuse cooldown and play aggressive as he drops. Once Zilen has finished his first element and once he has enough levels behind him, he will be able to pull a single blow from the minion wave and push incredibly fast. Stay out of the minion wave at any time, he is unable to poke and push at the same time. Do not disrespect Zilen=s Bombs Q damage to the middle and end of the game. He can make a surprising amount of burst damage if he is able to get a catch."}
{"text": "As garen, At level 9, Garen will have his first maximum ability. It is a decent power peak because it allows him to easily dull enemies and go for regular short-term exchanges. Once he manages to get 2 points in his Ultimate R, he will have an effortless time catching the out-of-guard enemies and killing them. He should use the river brushes to pretend to wander and then turn on the enemy mid-laner if they try to follow. His survival is excellent during the middle of the game, and he can run the enemies by peeling for his wears. If he takes a lot of damage, he can quickly retreat and leave his Passive kick."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, In lane, always make sure there\u2019s a minion between you and him at all times to make it really difficult for him to land his g.\n\nWhen playing as a ranged champion, try and abuse your auto attack range to poke him down and gain a health lead. Do not over-commit to poking though.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing as a utility Support, try taking Relic Shield instead of Spelltheif\u2019s Edge to make the laning phase safer."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of kill pressure in the mid-game, especially once she puts 2 points in her Ultimate R. The reduced cooldown and additional damage make her a huge threat during this stage of the game.\n\nCass should have her Tear stacked by this stage of the game. She will have a somewhat endless mana pool once it\u2019s maxed out.\n\nAt level 9, Cass will max out her E. As long as she lands her Q, her bully potential will be incredibly potent. Her all-in heavily intensifies at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "As jhin, By getting his Ultimate R maximized, he will be able to inflict massive amounts of damage and can completely decimate squishy targets. He will also be able to choose enemies for his team with his Ultimate R. His 4th shot will hit like a truck during this phase of the game. This means that the squishy enemies will never be safe, especially when Jhin is properly peeled by his team. Its release of damage and kiting potential will increase in the late game due to his articles. This also means that it will be pivotal towards obtaining neutral goals."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Gwen will be stronger when she has 4 piles on her Passive. Avoid committing to fight when she has maximum piles. When Gwen unlocks her Ultimate R, she will be much stronger and her trading power increases considerably. Extended trades will always work in her favor, especially once she's finished one or two items."}
{"text": "As diana, Play safely and wait until you have access to your main abilities. Don't let the enemy shoot you in the game very early. Whittle the enemy down with your Q before looking for all-in. Just because you land your Q, this doesn't mean you have to go in. However, you can crush the enemy easily if you are able to find a good all-in opportunity. In the toughest matchups or when the enemy is playing ultra-safe, look to wander. Diana has good roaming/all-in potential post 6 and can help her ally snowball. If you can't kill the enemy, look to wander with your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As poppy, Level 11 is relatively weak because it only gets the cooldown on the reduced ability. Compared to the other Junglers, it does not bring much to the table. Poppy is extremely powerful during this phase of the game because it can inflict constant damage and CC enemies for days. Its tankness makes it impossible for the enemy team to kill it as well. Level 9 is when its first ability will be maximized. This will allow it to treat a lot of damage to the enemies it has managed to catch. It will also allow it to counter the enemy's escape attempts."}
{"text": "As fiora, Really good duelist and can one vs one anyone if she manages to get a lead early on. Her Passive along with her Q allows her to do a lot of damage to both squishies and tanks alike while allowing her team to do what they want.\n\nHer W is the most important ability in her kit and she can completely negate any form of damage and CC with that ability. The fact that it can block the Ignite tick damage in itself can be tilting for her enemies. When used properly, she can even CC a group of enemy champions by countering any source of enemy CC.\n\nIf she manages to find someone separated from their team, she can one vs one them easily, even if she is behind. This is due to the amount of damage that she can dish out with her Passive and her Ultimate R. Such picks can easily allow her to pressurize and take over a portion of the map."}
{"text": "As morgana, Care for her range advantage and be mindful of her poke in lane.\n\nBait out her Q before attempting an engage to avoid getting caught in her crowd control.\n\nHer level 6 is stronger, as she can counter your all-in with her ultimate.\n\nStand away from minions to avoid being hit by her W while farming and to limit her wave push."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn cannot team fight easily. She will try to flank from the side with her Ultimate R and get on to a carry. Ward your flanks to make it harder for her to engage for free.\n\nIf Quinn can\u2019t team fight, she will stay in a side lane and try to split push. You can either send someone who has TP to prevent her from taking side towers, or you can quickly engage on to the enemy team and start a fight. Do not delay a team fight as it will give Quinn time to take an objective or rotate to join her team.\n\nQuinn\u2019s pick potential is high. When sieging an objective, make sure nobody in your team is too far forward as she can pick them off with her E and start the fight."}
{"text": "As pantheon, See if you can secure picks during this phase of the game when possible. You will begin to fall off, so you must avoid 5 v 5 team fights when possible.\n\nKeep track of the enemy Jungler and stay near-neutral objectives as much as possible. You don't want to get spotted on the other side of the map and lose a crucial objective out of nowhere.\n\nThe fog of war is your friend, and you will want to use it to flank the enemy when possible. The goal is to get rid of the enemy carries as quickly as you can. You may also opt for a tanky build and act as a frontline if need be."}
{"text": "As neeko, A maxed-out Ultimate R will let Neeko use the ability quite frequently. All she needs to do is find a flank on the enemy team.\n\nHer late-game team fighting is really potent. She can disrupt an entire team with a well-placed E or Ultimate R.\n\nHer damage during the late game is absolutely massive. One E > Q combo is enough to half-health any squishy target."}
{"text": "As zoe, Can a-shot squishies as soon as she gets her Ultimate R. Being hit by her E is a post-six death penalty, and her mobility Ultimate's R allows her to avoid hot skills. Her W is a power and can allow her to provide a lot of utility both for her team and herself. This ability can allow her to gain the way quite easily if she gets lucky. Zoe's E can be used to set up long-range ganks."}
{"text": "As akshan, Keep the wave closer to your side of the card in the game very early. It will protect you from the ganks and those who zone you away from the farm.

Keep it falling with your Q and W, but avoid pushing too much."}

Catching someone out when your team is nearby can easily result in a kill and possibly an objective after it."}
{"text": "As milio, Move towards the medium track and stay with your ADC in the medium track or shake hands with your Mid laners to prevent the enemy from taking the medium track level 1. Make sure to place the vision around the nearby tracks and targets. If you can spot the enemy moving around the map, your team may be able to collapse on them and get a free murder. Avoid moving too far away from your allies at any time. If you get caught out, the enemy may be able to take a nearby goal like Baron, Dragon, a tower or even win a 5v4."}
{"text": "As kayle, Play safely in the game early. You need time to come online and if you fall behind, you'll have trouble in the line and you'll delay your first major power peak. Focus on electric farming and minimize trading up to your level 6. Once you unlock your Ultimate R, you can start to be more aggressive. Once you're level 6, you can look at playing more aggressive than you can use your Ultimate R as a trading tool and something to come back on."}
{"text": "Against orianna, Orianna struggles against strong all-in. Try to all-in her when her Ball is far away from her.\n\nPay close attention to the location of Orianna\u2019s Ball throughout the laning phase.

If you stand close to them, the enemy may be able to CC both of you when they cast their Ultimate d on you."}
{"text": "As gangplank, Its Ultimate R should have an upgrade now. It will increase its overall efficiency in a fight, and the reduction of cooling time will help Gangplank win battles quickly. Gangplank will soon be able to put another point in its Ultimate R. Once done, its presence around the map will increase massively. It will also help a lot when it deals with neutral goals."}
{"text": "Against janna, Janna may try to ward alone in the mid and late game. If she does, try to ambush her by camping in a bush near the Baron or Dragon.\n\nIn team fights, Janna will try to use her e and d to knockback/knockup enemies to delay their engage. If you need to get on to the enemy to kill them, be prepared to flank from the side to make it harder for her to anticipate your movements. \n\nFor AD champions, invest in an Executioner's Calling when Janna is ahead. This will reduce her healing and shielding capability on her allies."}
{"text": "Against draven, You must be very respectful against Draven as he can bring down tons of damage if he gets a few dead in the laning phase. Keep an eye on his itemization as the game develops and plays accordingly. Draven is difficult to play in team fights as he must control his Axes g. In team fights, try to lock him up with CC to make it really difficult for him to pick up his Axes g and flatten the damage. Try to kill Draven every time his Adoration piles are high. He will deprive him of a huge influx of gold after getting a murder."}
{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze will try to avoid team fighting in the middle of the game because he still needs time to come online. The search for fights as soon as the laning phase is over is favorable. Team fighting in the last game is where Ryze can shine. Finishing the game as quickly as possible will reduce his chances of coming online and winning the fight for his team. Warding your flanks will reduce Ryze's ability to get a good final R and surprise your teammates. Avoid pushing too far forward when you don't know where Ryze is to reduce the chances of catching you with his ultimate R."}
{"text": "As senna, Level 2 in the lower lane is the first wave of minions followed by the next 3 minons of melee. Your goal during the laning phase is to search for murders and abuse the enemy as often as you can. Try to play aggressive frequently to get an advance.

She may be able to dodge CC or skill-shots this way and turn the exchange around.\n\nKai\u2019Sa will get buffed up by her Support in a team fight. Try to take down her Support first so she is left rather defenceless. "}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Pantheon is very strong in early play. Keep this in mind and be ready for him to play aggressive and go to kill. Once Pantheon is level 6, his death pressure does not increase much in the way, but his card and roaming potential does thanks to his Ultimate R. As soon as he disappears, make sure to communicate with your team as he can seek to wander. When Pantheon finishes his first article, his death pressure only increases. You will need to respect his potential of all-in-one when he has his first article."}

You will want to use your Q regularly to win fights."}
{"text": "Against rammus, Team fighting can be difficult for Rammus as most players will disengage as soon as he runs towards them.

{"text": "As kayle, The 2 points in his Ultimate R will give him another significant peak of power. This will allow him to get rid of a lot of damage. His first ability will be maximized to level 9.

Help them by destroying his wall and killing the Ghouls as soon as they spawn."}
{"text": "As lucian, Once Lucian unlocks his 3rd stage Ultimate R, he will be able to dish out tons of consistent damage, especially to low health targets. It will make it easier for him to burst down enemies.\n\nLucian will gain access to multiple items during this stage of the game. He will both be able to sustain himself, as well as deal hefty amounts of consistent damage.\n\nLucian's Q and E will be maxed out during this game stage. It will let him all-in enemies consistently and will allow him to reposition himself frequently."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn doesn\u2019t have a duelling Ultimate R. This makes her weak post level 6 when it comes to all-ins.\n\nShe cannot fight straight 5v5. She will need to flank in team fights. If the enemy has vision or knows where she is, she will be unable to team fight properly and will be forced to split push.\n\nYou are a champion that is prone to all-in and CC. Mix that with the fact that Quinn is quite squishy, it can be challenging to deal with enemy teams that have a lot of CC."}
{"text": "As tristana, The enemy can try to get away from her to prevent her from getting her E completely loaded, which has not managed to reset her to facilitate an escape. Her E without her Q is completely ineffective during the early match because she has no form of external attack speed on her. If she uses it negligently, the enemy can look for a commitment on her. She is completely useless if she falls behind during the early match. She is dependent on the articles and without them, the game could also be a 5 v 4 due to her inefficiency in the game."}
{"text": "As leesin, You have a lot of presence during the early game. Roam every opportunity you get, especially on pushed-up enemy targets, to get a lead.\n\nWarding will be an essential part of your playstyle during this phase of the game. The most important thing you want to do is keep a Control Ward in your inventory to use your Ultimate k efficiently.\n\nEfficient wave clearing is necessary to ensure that you can roam frequently. Don't be a miser when it comes to using your abilities as your Energy regenerates quite quickly."}
{"text": "As shaco, On maxing his Ultimate l, Shaco's ability to solo kill enemies will increase drastically. The AoE aspect of his Ultimate l will prevent enemies from grouping out as well.\n\nHe will be dishing out a lot of poke damage during this phase of the game. He can burst down squishy targets as well by invading the enemy backline from the fog of war.\n\nHe will fall off during the late game, so he will want to use his early game lead to win the game quickly. He should use the neutral, objective fights to snowball his lead as those are the places where he can use his Ultimate l most effectively."}
{"text": "As khazix, As you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective.\n\nTry to secure the Baron or Dragon whenever possible. Securing objectives is key as a Jungler during the mid-game.\n\nContinue to farm your jungle as well as gank and help your allies. It\u2019s important that you do not fall behind in gold and XP by just ganking."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, Aatrox is strong from 2-6 levels. Make sure to keep your distance to make it harder for him to land his Q and push you down. Aatrox peaks when he gets his first article (as well as both components). Respect his everything in the potential when he has finished the recipe as his damage production will increase sharply. Aatrox is really strong no matter if you can't avoid all the cases of his Q. Practice makes perfect, but try to avoid them every time you are able to."}
{"text": "As diana, Play safely and wait until you have access to your main abilities. Don't let the enemy shoot you in the game very early. Whittle the enemy down with your Q before looking for all-in. Just because you land your Q, this doesn't mean you have to go in. However, you can crush the enemy easily if you are able to find a good all-in opportunity. In the toughest matchups or when the enemy is playing ultra-safe, look to wander. Diana has good roaming/all-in potential post 6 and can help her ally snowball. If you can't kill the enemy, look to wander with your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As ekko, When Ekko hits level 3, he can start to look for aggressive plays as he would\u2019ve unlocked all 3 of his basic abilities. Until that time, he can fight, but he will unlikely gain any significant advantage.\n\nAs Ekko can deal a lot of burst damage, once he has completed his Mythic item, his kill pressure intensifies.\n\nAt level 6, Ekko becomes an incredible threat. He can go for risky plays and use his Ultimate R to escape. His Ultimate R can also be used aggressively, which makes it incredibly versatile. You can look for riskier all-ins post 6 as long as you cast your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As janna, Look to harass the enemy as often as possible in the early game. This will allow you to get your Support item quest done rather quickly.\n\nYour main focus in lane should be to peel and protect your ADC as much as possible. If you or they fall behind, it\u2019s going to be harder for you to win the lane and the game.\n\nKeep an eye on your positioning in lane. Try to adapt your positioning accordingly and play around where your ADC is stood at all times. If you\u2019re too far back, they will struggle to farm and you\u2019ll have no priority in lane."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, Ward your flanks as Mordekaiser may try to attack from the side in order to get on a high valued target with his Ultimate R.\n\nIf Mordekaiser misses his E in a team fight, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad time to focus him down as he will be unable to pull your team in when his E is on cooldown.\n\nAvoid starting major objectives like the Baron or a Dragon when Mordekaiser is nearby as he can take your Jungler into the Shadow Realm with his R which will make taking the objective risky."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Place the vision inside and close to its entrances into the jungle. This will reduce its usefulness and its ability to spoil as your team can see before it gets to their track. It will also reduce its ability to use its Ultimate. Fiddlesticks will try to powerfarm up to level 6 where it gets access to its Ultimate. Try to invade it if you notice it on the opposite side of the map to delay its level 6 power peak. Unless you can surprise it (like attacking from inside a bush), it will be quite difficult to kill it alone because it will often use its Q and run away. If you invade, try to stick to the bushes to make it easier. Otherwise, team up with an ally and try to collapse on it."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan IV will unlock his d > e combo at level two, which will allow him to catch and surpass the enemies with the greatest ease. This will also allow him to show extreme prowess during Jungle's duels. Jarvan's first element will give him a massive boost to his duel and survival. He will now be able to put his d Passive to good use, especially if he manages to catch an enemy on his own. Jarvan IV will unlock the ability to completely separate an enemy from their team and lock them at level 6. It is incredibly beneficial when the main objective is to separate a single target and get rid of them quickly."}
{"text": "As sett, When fighting Sett, make sure that you don't go for extended trades. Sett will be able to chunk you out easily otherwise.\n\nHe may try to get some healing reduction early on. It can significantly hinder your survivability so make sure you keep an eye out for it.\n\nSett will try to ult you into your team. Make sure you reposition yourself quickly so that Sett has a hard time doing so.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As swain, Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take control of the fights very easily. Its damage output will be quite phenomenal as well. His presence in the middle of the game and his combat style is really great. He can delimit the enemies and separate the enemy front line from the rear line. He can also choose targets out. The first ability will be maximized at level 9, adding a lot of brilliant damage to his kit."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Keep poking the enemy with your Q and E in the lane. Try not to use your Q in the middle of the lane to ensure that you can regularly throw multiple pellets of your Q.\n\nYour C will be handy during this phase of the game. Remember to all-in the enemy from out of vision for maximum effectiveness.\n\nYour Ultimate R will allow you to roam around a lot more in this game. It will enable you to prevent enemies from entering crucial points like the neutral objective pits or separate out enemies.        "}
{"text": "Against kindred, Once Kindred hits level 6, she will be much stronger as she can use her Ultimate R to go for more unorthodox ganks.\n\nAs the game goes along, Kindred will become stronger and stronger with the more stacks she gets. Try to secure them whenever possible to slow down the snowball effect.\n\nAfter Kindred has completed her jungling item, she will be a much stronger duellist and really good at kiting. Keep this in mind and think twice when fighting her."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Once Xerath is level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate 2, it will have a lot of poke and extra damage. Do not stay at Lane 6 post as it might be able to sting you. Xerath is good in team fighting as long as he is able to poke and harass with p before a fight starts. It is not very good in team fighting if he is unable to poke in advance. So, make sure to engage as soon as you spot him."}
{"text": "As shaco, Look for choices all around the map during this phase of the game. If you can take a portage from the enemy team, the next fight will be about a guaranteed victory. Use your Ultimate L carefully during this phase of the game. Remember that you can easily target the enemy backline with it while your team deals with the enemy front line. When fighting around bottlenecks, make sure that you adjust your x correctly."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As irelia, In the late game, continue to split push if your team isn\u2019t at risk of dying or getting caught out.\n\nIf your team is going to get caught out or if the game isn\u2019t one-sided, you need to group with your team to help them fight.\n\nPlay on the side of the map that has the next major objective up so you can rotate to take it with your team. Alternatively, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the map and use it to get to your team."}
{"text": "Against teemo, At level 6, Teemo's pressure increases thanks to its Ultimate t giving it additional damage and the possibility to place mushrooms t all around the map. The more haste Teemo buys, the more it can place mushrooms t around the map. Try to take an unorthodox path to prevent walking through them. Nashors Dent is a central element for Teemo. It gives it a lot of additional statistics- which makes it more of a threat."}
{"text": "As yorick, Once his Ultimate R maiden is killed, he loses a lot of sustained DPS in a team fight. Picking the maiden off before a fight won\u2019t let him dish out a lot of damage to you.\n\nIn the lane, Yorick will use his Q ghouls to get him the push advantage, as well as the poke advantage in the lane. Killing these ghouls first will take a lot of damage off Yorick.\n\nUsing waveclear abilities against Yorick will put a period to his pushing power. Following his movements on the map will give you an opportunity to always thwart his split-push attempts. Also, the team may need Grievous Wounds to beat Yorick."}
{"text": "Against brand, The more the game goes, the stronger the brand is thanks to the items it will get. Try to place it behind in the early game to reduce its gold income and prevent a snowball. Once the brand reaches level 6, its release of damage and the ability to kill you will be much higher thanks to its Ultimate R. If you are weak, make sure you remember that it can easily burst and kill you. The brand is not very strong in the early game. You can use this to your advantage by getting as much as you can to get your allies before."}
{"text": "Against brand, When you play as a champion of engagement, target him as soon as he advances to harass you for free. Don't let Brand harass you. Try to stand back and out of his reach so that he is unable to attack you and harass you with his W. Make sure you stay healthy otherwise you will never be able to fight him. A good time to fight Brand is when he comes out of mana or has a ability on cooldown. This will make the trade much better for you because he won't be able to flatten a lot of damage (or maybe stun you if his Q is on cooldown) as he will have 1 less ability to use."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce doesn't really have a peak at level 6 due to his Ultimate G level one. This also means that he has access to three other variations of ability that his opponent. He should use them to get a pre-6 lead. Jayce is weak early on and counts on his w > s combo to get the enemies out before going for a murder. This will allow him to win an advance and break the enemy once they are low enough. The first component will give Jayce a boost to the damage and allow him to play more aggressively. It will allow Jayce to go for frequent bursting exchanges after he has torched the enemy with his w > s combo."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine has low base stats and is pretty vulnerable in the early game. Play safe and avoid taking damage to increase your survivability.\n\nSeraphine lacks an escape tool. This reduces her chances of dodging skill shots and makes it harder for her to escape an all-in from the enemy.\n\nThe shield and heal you get from your W is pretty lackluster, especially in the early game. Do not rely on it to save you or your ADC\u2019s life."}
{"text": "As rumble, You will want to avoid fighting him when his resource bar is more than half filled in this matchup. You will be taking a lot of damage otherwise.\n\nUse your Passive properly along with your e. Also, make sure that you CC him when his resource bar is about to be half filled, and back off immediately.\n\nDo not go in without your team close by during fights. This is to ensure that you don't get separated from your team.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As leesin, If Lee Sin falls behind in the early game, he will struggle in the later parts of the game.\n\nLee Sin is vulnerable to hard engage and CC. If the enemy has lots of CC, you will need to play around their CC tools if you want to perform any cool manoeuvres with your Ultimate k.\n\nHe struggles in the lane when playing against champions with good counter engage, short cooldowns and range: especially if they know how to manage the minion waves."}
{"text": "As kayn, Once Kayn gets 2 points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to all-in enemies much more frequently. It will be perfect since he will also get his form.\n\nHis Q will be maxed out at level 9. This is really helpful for him as it is his paramount damage ability. It will allow him to dish out a lot of damage and kill squishies and tanks (depending on his form).\n\nDuring the mid-game, he should be able to get multiple picks on the enemy team. Since the enemy team will be in disarray, securing picks will become very easy for Kayn, especially on the enemy Support."}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz is an incredibly weak champion up until at least level 3. If he gets poked down, he will not be able to look for an early all-in or first blood.\n\nEven though he is incredibly mobile with his E, when it is on cooldown, he is incredibly squishy and immobile. Even with his E available, he is pretty squishy if he gets hit with CC. \n\nFizz needs to get ahead early to do well in the later stages of the game. If he loses lane or doesn\u2019t have a lot of gold, he will not be much of a threat in the mid-game."}
{"text": "As soraka, Level 16 is an excellent peak for Soraka as her healing will be very powerful and will rise quite frequently. Since she eliminates slender injuries, the team struggle has become easy for her team. So much her W and Q will be maximized during this game phase. She should face a lot of constant damage, and her healing will be above par. Killing her wearings will be phenomenally easy. Her W will be completely maximized and will let her heal her allies for significant amounts. Her Ultimate R will be the final nail on the coffin for the enemy team because it will eliminate the slender wounds and give her team a massive recovery."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Nautilus can start crashing as soon as he reaches level 3. As he has the most CC out of any champion in the game, he can easily gank early. His level 6 power peak is incredibly strong. A good Nautilus will continue to crash every time his Ultimate e is in place. When Nautilus finished his Mythic element, his trading power and his ability to 1v1 the enemy Jungler will be very high."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Use the track brushes to get a edge on the enemy travelers. You can easily CC and poke them with your basic capabilities as you will be hidden. If the enemy's lantern wanders, don't bother trying to challenge their roaming. Instead, push the minion wave and start winning the gold turret. You will naturally push the minion wave with your Q. As you push, keep a constant eye on the map. Heimer is vulnerable to the ganks if he doesn't have his Q turrets, so keep that in mind."}
{"text": "As yorick, Tremendous push potential with a habit of taking the entire lane if left unchecked for a while. This power is increased when his Ultimate R is available to him.\n\nYorick\u2019s basic abilities can be really obnoxious to the enemy in the lane, especially when he is against a melee matchup. He can use this power to further increase his pushing/catching up potential, and secure a gold lead over his laner.\n\nHis Ultimate R can be released down a lane to push that lane in his stead. This can put the enemy team in a disarray, as both Yorick and his maiden can push two different lanes simultaneously."}
{"text": "As talon, A maxed-out Ultimate R should help Talon a lot during this phase of the game. This will help him a lot by escaping unpleasant situations or trying to kill a heavyweight. He will begin to fall during this phase of the game as the enemy will build defensive objects now. He should keep track of cooldowns of the items so he can hit at the right time. Most of his abilities will be maximized during this phase of the game. This means a lot of damage to his end and he is extremely slippery during the fights. CC will be his worst enemy during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "As malphite, His game plan for early play should involve power farming until he gets his Ultimate h. That's because he has no way of gank other tracks unless they are drastically overstretched. Level six is a massive peak of power that Malphite will now be able to pull ganks and disrupt the flights. This is really useful when the enemy is still and does not have Flash. Its first element will allow him to take more fighting and clean the jungle camps quickly."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Stand behind the minions at all times to minimize Taliyah's Q damage. Blow out his W before committing to avoid being overturned. Its level 6 allows him to counter your roaring, so consider moving from the base to the place. Avoid standing in the minion wave after she has obtained her first article to reduce the damage taken from her thrust."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Can inflict heavy amounts of damage in very short time, which gives the enemy very little time to react. Such a C E Q combo can ruin the lives of enemy travellers. Its Ultimate R allows him to cross a long distance almost immediately and can provide a lot of utility in the bottlenecks. It will also give him traction to easily land his C. His E is really effective against enemies who have some form of dash. It can thus make life a living hell for travelers who rely a lot on dashes."}
{"text": "As xerath, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning. You need to poke the enemy down and delay fights in the late game, but you need to watch your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not get picked off by trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As xerath, Very immobile and susceptible to crowd control from the enemy team, especially when he is charging his p up.\n\nCan be easily all-in\u2019d if he uses his r carelessly and he doesn\u2019t have his Flash up. Can be flanked with ease when he is pushed up in the lane due to his in-built waveclear.\n\nHis Ultimate 2 can easily be interrupted and can be used as a traction to target him and get rid of him immediately. Xerath will need to position properly before using his Ultimate 2 , else there is a good chance that he will get killed immediately."}
{"text": "As gragas, Its Ultimate R can easily be avoided by enemies who have dashes or tools of movement. If the enemy has a good positioning in the track, it will be very difficult for you to engage or use your E in the track. It is because your E can be blocked by minions if the target is not directly behind them."}
{"text": "As leona, This champions level 2 is incredibly strong. They can often gain a health advantage or Summoner advantage in the lane by playing aggressive and looking for an early all-in.\n\nYou have very good roaming potential once you have Boots of Mobility. This gives you tons of map pressure. \n\nWhenever your Ultimate e is up, you have a lot of extra kill pressure. Look for picks whenever you have your Ultimate e up."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Unfortunately, Nautilus does not have the fastest clear in the game, but it is a little healthy. It does not have as great objective control, so you will need your allies to help you take the Dragon and Rift Herald. Can be difficult to gank your allies if the minion wave is between you and the enemy."}
{"text": "As zilean, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}

{"text": "As rengar, He is the number one public enemy for any squishy wear in the game. He can practically a-shot with one or two items and can tilt someone hard enough to win the game easily. His early duelling power is really strong, especially if he is in the front line and has access to the track brushes. He can throw a snowball this way, which can easily allow him to win games."}
{"text": "As viego, Just focus on agriculture while keeping the wave on your side of the track. You don't want to overextend, as you will certainly be ganked. You should go for short burst trades when possible. Use your E on the side walls to make sure you can use the stealth function to escape sticky situations. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should try to fight more often."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm needs to ensure that he activates his E mid-fight. Activating it too late is pointless because the enemy will disengage, and you will waste the shield. \n\nHe is very immobile which means he is really easy to chase down even with his W up. If the enemy freezes the lane, he cannot do anything to escape an all-in/gank.\n\nAs Tahm Kench is a melee champion, laning against ranged champions is very hard for him as they can poke him down whenever he walks forward or positions somewhat aggressively. Ranged champions can also zone him incredibly well."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Its ultimate makes it very difficult for the enemy not to take any poke damage. It is especially true if Kog. Maw goes for AP construction. With the appropriate coat, it can take a game quite easily due to its Q and e. It also has a certain amount of self-peel with its e, but it is better for him to keep his distance from CC."}
{"text": "As fiora, Look for constant skirmishes with the enemy to gain health or kill lead. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in early play. This will allow you to hunt and all-in-the-enemy when they walk to the farm with your Q. Once you are level 6, use your strength to fight the enemy and go for a kill. Your Ultimate R is an excellent duel tool and can help you get a lead in the way."}
{"text": "Against hwei, Step away from the wave of minions so it can't push you and push you simultaneously. Abusing its still nature by forcing it to lie down, then ask for a gank and turn it off.

{"text": "As jax, Once you are complete build, you should be able to decimate the entire enemy team with your Ultimate t and o. Just make sure that you don't dive too deeply into the enemy team without your team supporting you. It should be easy for you to get spikes on the side track. Use the war fog and Jungle brushes to set up ambushes for the enemy team. Your e has the potential for CC all the enemy team. Use it from the fog of war and the flank to enter the enemy rear line. Separate the enemy front line from the rear line should be relatively easy for you."}
{"text": "As ornn, The second point of its Ultimate R will increase the damage to the ability and allow it to play games frequently. Several articles will allow it to absorb a lot of damage in the fighting. It should be part of as many fights as possible. The first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will cause a lot of damage to the enemy team and increase the frequency of use of this ability. Anyone near the terrain will have a difficult time."}
{"text": "As maokai, If Maokai throws a Sapling in a bush, you can walk up to it then dash out of the way with your E so it doesn\u2019t damage you. If a wave is nearby, run to it. The damage from the explosion of his Sapling will be on the wave which will force it to push towards you which leaves him in a vulnerable place for an all in.\n\nExtended trades work heavily in your favour against Maokai. Try to keep them going for as long as possible as he will not be able to out damage you early.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This will force Maokai to over extend if he wants to farm. Keeping the wave here also allows you to zone him away from farm, or trade aggressively if he attempts to last hit a minion.\n\nMaokai can escape your W and dodge your Q's easily with his W. Either wait for his W to be on cooldown before committing to a fight or bait it out and use his overextended positioning to finish your combo."}
{"text": "As rumble, Use the lane brushes and regularly burst down Rumble when possible. This is the easiest way to win this lane over.\n\nAvoid fights when his resource bar is half filled. You will take a lot of damage and will probably even die if his ultimate is ready.\n\nHis Ultimate can easily separate you from your allies, resulting in you getting signled out by Rumble's team. Be very careful about it.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ezreal's first power peak is when he takes Sheen. His Q damage will increase considerably and he will look to poke constantly. Once Ezreal has finished his Manamune and upgraded it to Muramana, his damage output and maintain will be much higher. Every time Ezreal has his E, it is much safer and harder to kill. Try to abuse cooldown whenever you can."}
{"text": "As illaoi, Stick with your team in the later stages of the game. Avoid moving too far away from them.\n\nLook for picks with your E in the late game. Landing an E with the follow-up damage from your team could result in a kill or a favourable fight.\n\nContinue to delay team fights when possible so you can get your Passive tentacles down."}
{"text": "As shaco, The first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This ability will now hit like a truck, and he can quickly assassinate enemies if they are low.\n\nShaco is pretty decent during team fights. This is mainly because his clone can cause all-around mayhem for the enemy team. His ability to sneak behind the enemy team is phenomenal.\n\nTeam fights will become better for Shaco.

Do not let him take your towers for free while you skirmish in the mid lane. "}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Disengagement is Master Yi's worst nightmare. As soon as he activates his Ultimate r and runs to your team, disengagement so that he can not resume the fight. When he is weak, make sure to get over it even if Master Yi is not there. If he takes free and easy blows, he will make heavy snowballs and take over from the next team fight. Try to wait for Master Yi to use his e before locking him up with CC. As he can use his e to avoid skill blows and CC if time is correct, it is best to wait for him to use this ability before trying to kill him."}

Although Annie has a lot of damage, she starts to fall at the end of the game as the champions start building defensive elements. Keep this in mind before trying to make aggressive games. At level 16, Annie will have 3 points in her Ultimate R. Tibbers will do a lot of damage if it is used in conjunction with the rest of her abilities and Passive."}

The first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will help him to reduce a lot of damage to enemies that he manages to get his hands on. During this phase of the game, several articles will allow him to flatten a lot of damage while surviving fights with ease."}
{"text": "As akali, At this point, your knowledge of the map should be at its peak. You should always try to push the wave with your Q and try to go towards any path that has an extended laner. This will allow you to use your E and Ultimate to catch up with such wide targets, and get rid of them quickly. When you fight for a neutral goal and you manage to land an E on an enemy champion, you do not need to always go-in. That's because your presence, and the threat of your E, W and R that automatically keeps the enemy away from you. This will eventually allow the enemy team to be zoned. The correct use of your W is very important during this stage of the game. If used freely, the enemy laner can drag you into such an all-in and then get rid of Akali quickly."}
{"text": "As twitch, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall behind in the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure to continue growing! As you are a Jungler, you must try to secure each Drake during the middle of the game. Get them and secure the Dragon soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game. Look for choices with your team. If you can choose someone, make the call for Baron or Dragon to continue your lead."}
{"text": "As darius, If Darius is able to land his E on you and shoot you in, do not use your W immediately. Use it once Darius has used his W so you can remove the slow and potentially escape. Before looking for a whole in it, make sure that Darius is below 50% health by dropping it with your Q. If he is more than 50% health, don't bother aggressively trading. When you fight in Darius, try to avoid long trades with him as he will come out with his Passive. Keep pleasant and short trades, preferably where you are able to stay outside his E range. Always keep mental distance between you and Darius. If you are close to him, he will be able to pull you with his E. Try to stay out of reach of that ability at any time."}
{"text": "As galio, Stay near your team at all times in the late game. While your Ultimate R has a long range, the enemy may force a fight when you show elsewhere on the map.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R and wait for one of your allies to engage. Once they\u2019ve gone in, use your Ultimate R on them. Alternatively, wait for the enemy to engage and then cast your Ultimate R on a carry.\n\nPeel for your carries in late game team fights. Keeping them alive for as long as possible will increase your chances of winning team fights."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, The more articles it gets, the harder it will be to kill. Keep this in mind and try to deny it firm, XP, gold and resources to reduce its efficiency in the later parts of the game. At level 6, Nautilus will be extremely scary. It can get Jungler help in the way to kill you as its Ultimate e is a great gank configuration tool. It will be good in team fighting thanks to its Ultimate e that is point and click on CC. It also has tons of CC that will make it really effective in fighting."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus is at his weakest in the early game. Try to deny as many stacks as possible so he is unable to scale quickly.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Nasus gets. Make sure you end the game as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile he will be focusing on farming, once he has his Ultimate R, his kill pressure will increase and so will his survivability. Make sure you\u2019re not too cocky otherwise he can turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "Against ekko, Lock Ekko in the team fights will prevent him from using his Ultimate R to escape with. Keep track of his Ultimate R in the fights as he can use it to organize an escape or engage. Keep the vision in typical flank locations like Ekko will try to set up a engagement with his W of out of sight. If you see him running towards you, step back for a few seconds as he would have used his W. When no team fights occur, Ekko will seek to divide the thrust. Avoid leaving him alone in a side lane by making sure that there is always someone who fits him."}
{"text": "As sejuani, It is exceptionally tanky during this phase of the game. Its articles will make it take significantly less damage, and it can even instigate dives turn to finish the enemies. The Ultimate R is a massive peak that allows Sejuani to use the ability frequently. The damage of the ability increases quite decently as well. Its team struggle is quite decent during this phase of the game. It can CC its enemies for a long time, and the damage inflicted by it is quite powerful."}
{"text": "As senna, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin\u2019s early game is very strong. He can go for aggressive plays frequently during the laning phase to get an early lead over the enemy.\n\nAt level 6, Lee Sin will unlock his Ultimate k. His all-in and kill pressure heavily increases at this stage of the game.\n\nThe first item will allow him to get a damage boost and increased survivability during all-ins. It will give him more chances to get a kill during a duel."}
{"text": "As chogath, The longer the game goes, the more stacks Cho\u2019Gath will have. This makes him quite strong in the late game.\n\nWhen he hits level 16, Cho\u2019Gath will put the third and final point in his Ultimate t. He will be able to easily bite down on and execute enemies who are caught out of position by his team.\n\nDepending on his build path, Cho\u2019Gath will either deal a lot of damage in late game fights or be incredibly tanky."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven is a dominant early-playing champion who can take the way through short trades. Try not to trade with her unless you can match her trading potential. Riven will often play hyper-aggressive and try to overplay with her e. If possible, try to lure her main abilities and then reconnect with her when she has cooldowns. This is your best bet during laning against a Riven. Keep the minion wave frozen near your turn. If you play near your turn, her all-in-pot potential is limited as the tower will protect you and she won't be able to look for frequent trades."}
{"text": "As diana, Her post-six potential is really strong. This allows her to shoot down any squishy target she manages to put her Q on, which makes it very difficult for the enemy squishies to push up in their tracks. Unlike her counterparts, Diana has integrated the tankness that allows her to do everything with her Q, t, and Ultimate R combo quite easily. It's very valuable trying to pull out a group of three or more champions, especially when the enemy team is not aware of your position. Maybe one of the best flankers in the game. She can pull out the enemy backline almost instantly during a team fight if she is left unchecked."}
{"text": "As irelia, If you can get a kill or get a health advance early, you will have an easier time during the laning phase. Once you are level 6, play aggressive and look for a murder. You should try to get them low before committing to the all-in, but it should be the simple veil. Remember that your Q will reset if you use it on a weak health minion. Keep a constant eye on the minion wave and look for these aggressive games."}
{"text": "Against brand, The brand is really strong at level 2 and 3 when it gets access to more abilities. Be ready to back down slightly when it gets the level up so that you don't risk losing your health bar. The more the game goes, the stronger brand gets thanks to the items it will get. Try to put it behind in the game early to reduce its gold income and prevent a snowball. Once the brand reaches level 6, its release of damage and the ability to kill you will be much higher thanks to its ultimate R. If you are weak, make sure you remember because it can easily burst and kill you."}
{"text": "Against shen, When there are no team fights occurring and when Shen\u2019s Ultimate R is up, you\u2019ll find him split pushing. Make sure there is someone who can match him in the lane with him so he is unable to split push for free.\n\nTake care as Shen has good ambush potential in the mid-game thanks to his E. Do not go to ward/ walk in unwarded parts of the map if you know Shen has been nearby as it may result in your death.\n\nForcing team fights when Shen is unable to impact them (such as when his Ultimate R is down) will help your team come out ahead. Force a fight once his Ultimate R is down."}
{"text": "As briar, When you get your first component element, your damage output will be quite high and you will be fatal in the skirmishes. At level 3, you can technically start to glove like you unlock every 3 of your basic capabilities. At level 6, you will have your Ultimate R. You must be proactive and look for gank every time your Ultimate R is up."}
{"text": "Against alistar, Alistar can and will probably engage as soon as you enter the range. Try to stay within the maximum range at any time to limit its ability to engage with its t>e. Even if Alistars Headbutt is a point and click capability, you can still dodge it by pointing, flashing or flashing before it hits you. You can also interrupt the dash with punches, punches or punches. Alistar will try to wander if the track is blocked. Make sure to punish it by trying to fight the enemy CDA or zone them away from the farm while it's gone. Make sure that you ping as soon as it leaves the track so your allies know it's gone."}
{"text": "As lucian, Get Level 2 first and look for a favorable trade with the enemy. Earning an early health benefit will help you. Focus on agriculture and looking for aggressive games once the enemy uses a ability. Play around their abilities and try to abuse their cooldowns with your early game damage. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle track and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a golden lead."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax is a strong ganker, and his ganks are easy to perform. All he needs to do is get close and use his e to CC the target.\n\nJax\u2019s skirmishing power is excellent, and he can trade with or out fight pretty much all enemy Junglers.\n\nHe is good at securing objectives on his own. This allows him and his team to get an excellent objective lead for free.\n"}
{"text": "As lulu, Lulu can keep her allies alive for a long period of time with her E and Ultimate R in team fights. This increases her allies ability to deal damage and survive team fights.\n\nYou have a lot of poke thanks to your Q and E. This can allow you to win 1v1 fights with the enemy. You can also use your E to shield yourself rather than using it on the enemy.\n\nHas tons of utility that can assist her in a plethora of scenarios. Lulu is a solid pick and can fit into plenty of team compositions."}
{"text": "As xerath, The third point of its Ultimate 2 will allow Xerath to inflict increased damage to the enemies. The number of shots will also increase, giving Xerath more chances to hit an enemy reliably. It offers a lot of poke during the later parts of the game. This comes within reach before neutral objective fighting, as the enemy team will not be able to do everything or contest this goal because of their escape. Xerath is huge during team fighting because its capabilities can burst several targets with a single shot. It will destroy the enemy if it happens that they are piled together."}
{"text": "As lillia, She will be able to maximize her Ultimate R at level 16. This will have a significant impact on team fighting since her Ultimate R will be on a very short cooldown. Lillia is excellent in team fighting at the end of the game. This is due to her AoE abilities and mobility, which can allow her to get a 5-man Ultimate R. Lillia will now have several articles."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Lissandra will use her Q & E to push the wave. Stand outside the minion wave so she is forced to choose between pushing with her Q or trying to poke you instead. When Lissandra is level 6, you will need to play a little safer because she has increased the pressure to kill and can install her Jungler very easily. Make sure you have enough vision around your path to spot the enemy Jungler before they show up and spank you. When you play as a melee champion, try to stay at maximum range at any time so it is harder for Lissandra to you CC with her W. Be careful when you walk forward for the last strike, and play respectfully if she zoning you to not take tons of damage."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, When there are no team fights, go to a side track and focus on agriculture and win XP and gold. In team fights, try to flank the enemy. This will increase your chances of getting a good R Ultimate."}
{"text": "As malphite, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate h is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss out on the potential knockup it provides.\n\nYour Ultimate h will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As sett, He is pretty intense early on and can burst down enemies by going for regular trades against them. His W should help him a lot during this phase of the game.\n\nThe first item component will increase his overall capability to fight and survive. His W will hit like a truck now. \n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as it allows Sett to pick off one enemy and separate them from the team. He will want to suplex a tanky enemy into the enemy team, though        "}
{"text": "As camille, She can pretty much duel anyone during this phase of the game. The only thing Camille should be careful about is her E usage. Missing it will probably end up with her getting chunked out massively.\n\nCamille should try to focus on the enemy backline and zoning them off the enemy frontline when possible. Picking off the enemy Support should be pretty easy because they will be focusing on warding around the map.\n\nHer Ultimate R will be the icing on the cake during this phase of the game. It can easily allow her to separate one of the enemy champions from their team, allowing her teammates to immediately collapse on them."}
{"text": "As urgot, Three points in his Ultimate R will make Urgot really scary. Anyone who gets caught by Urgot will probably end up dying because of the amount of damage he can dry out in a short time. Urgot is really tanky at the end of the game. Due to his articles, he will have a respectable amount of support, which will make it really difficult for the enemy to kill him. Team fights will be Urgot's bread and butter as he can do the front line quite efficiently while pulling tons of damage to the enemy team. He can also separate the front line from the enemy team from the backline line, denying the threat of all-in on his team."}
{"text": "As drmundo, This is a tank versus tank matchup. Probably avoid fighting him as you\u2019ll be wasting time. Only fight him if you\u2019re 100% sure you\u2019re going to get the kill.\n\nBe proactive with your Ultimate as it will heavily increase your likelihood of getting kills from ganks. Gank whenever your Ultimate is up.\n\nFocus on securing those objectives. You must take Rift Heralds and Drakes whenever you can.

{"text": "As veigar, At this stage of the game, you want to get into a side track and focus on getting piles so you have a stronger game late. In the later parts of the middle game and when the enemy starts to group, make sure to follow up and start grouping with your team. Look for choices with your n. If you can catch someone during the middle game with it, your team should be able to kill them pretty quickly. Once you've killed someone, make the call for Drake or Baron."}
{"text": "As twistedfate, You should only w in when he just used his w. Abus the cooldown to go for a greedy business. Stand outside the wave so he doesn't land his w or q on you when he pushes the wave. Post 6, keep him pushed in so it's impossible for him to wander. At level 6, tristana is much stronger than twisted destiny. Use this to your advantage to get an advance."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim is an early game strong Jungler. Try your hardest to gank as often as you can for you and your allies in advance. As it is a strong skirmish, look to invade the enemy jungle to steal their camps. This not only reduce their gold income, but it will make you stronger overall and make your mid-game much more effective. Although ganking is the key, you need to find a healthy balance between farming and ganking. If you focus on either, it will be harder for you to win the game."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana is very weak pre-6, and you are much stronger than her. Go and invade her and try to fight her to deny her gold and XP.\n\nPost 6, it will be harder to fight her alone, so keep this in mind if you want to play aggressively.\n\nTry to gank as often as you can early. You\u2019re much stronger than her and can get a lead just by being active on the map.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about Shyvana\u2019s Passive.

This will help her shut down the enemy.\n\nThe first item component will allow her to increase her overall dueling potential. She will be doing a lot of damage as well as casting more abilities with it.        "}
{"text": "As senna, Just like in the middle of the game, you have to stay with your support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone because you will die easily. Do not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and automatic attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will concentrate and down you. Continue kiteing in team fights and systematically adapt your positioning."}
{"text": "As braum, As you are a Support, avoid dealing alone in the late game. If you are chosen, the enemy will be able to take goals nearby or use their digital advantage to win a team fight. Constantly place the vision around the map to help your team secure goals and get choices. Having a vision around the Baron and Dragon is necessary to help your team win. In the late game, make sure you are with your team at any time. If you leave them, the enemy can start a fight without you being there to protect them and keep them alive."}
{"text": "Against zoe, Stand at the opposite side of the lane at all times. This will make it harder for her to land her Q and E.\n\nEnsure that you\u2019re always behind the minion wave and not inside it. As Zoe\u2019s Q deals AOE damage, you will take damage if you\u2019re near the minion line.\n\nWhen trading, keep an eye on what spell (if any) Zoe has picked up. If it is an aggressive spell, expect her to look for a trade. If it\u2019s Flash, expect her to be more mobile and if it\u2019s a defensive spell, it will be harder for you to kill her."}
{"text": "As sion, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As neeko, Don't fight at the end of the game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available because you're going to miss the extra damage and CC. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooling time in the last stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your efforts to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As thresh, Thresh is one of the hardest Supports to master. It will take you a lot of time and effort to play him to his full potential.\n\nIs pretty squishy. If you look for a pick and miss, the enemy can collapse on you and kill you with ease. This makes it incredibly important that you land your skill shots.\n\nIs skill shot reliant and his skill shots are not easy to land. This is a drawback as you\u2019re only going to be useful if you can consistently hit those Qs."}
{"text": "As warwick, Focus on farming and hitting level 6 as quickly as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your ganking potential.\n\nYour Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Whenever it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get kills.\n\nTry to secure objectives with your team. If you can, try to keep it warded at all times if you\u2019re not in a position to take it yourself."}
{"text": "As taric, Once Taric has managed to get his boots, he will be much more effective in roaring and skirmishes. That's because he's going to stick to his target for a longer time and stack his Q. Level 6 is an important pick-up because Taric gains the ability to not completely any form of damage from all of his team for a short time. It's perfect when it comes to strong and commitment-based teams. At level 4, Taric will have two points in his Q. It's really beneficial because the amount of constant healing he gives to him and his ADC/teamates can really change the tide of a fight."}
{"text": "As annie, Annie\u2019s first power spike is at level 3 when she unlocks all 3 of her abilities. She can protect her ADC or herself with her E, which is traditionally taken third. This offers her more playmaking potential and also more survivability.\n\nAnnie will always be a little bit strong when she has her stun ready or almost ready. If the enemy looks to fight you while you have max stacks, you can quickly turn around the fight.\n\nAnnie\u2019s best power spike in lane is once she unlocks Tibbers R. She can look for aggressive picks and Flash plays with Tibbers and her stun."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Can deal heavy amounts of burst damage in a very short time, which gives the enemy very little time to react. One such C E Q combo can ruin the enemy laners life.\n\nHer Ultimate R allows her to traverse a long distance almost immediately and can provide a lot of utility in choke points. This will also give her traction to easily land her C.\n\nHer E is really effective against enemies who have some form of dash. She can thus make life a living hell for laners who rely a lot on dashes."}
{"text": "As sett, It can be trapped to the oblivion, especially when it is against a varied carrier with some form of pelure tip. Misuse of its W can cause it to kill because it is its only form of mitigation of damage. It cannot easily escape if someone includes it after using this ability. If the enemy is intelligent, they will avoid regrouping during the fighting. This will prevent Sett from effectively using its Ultimate R, because it was not able to land much damage or slow down several members of the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is good in team fights thanks to its AOE Ultimate R. Force a fight or fights when Swain is nearby will make it easier for your team to win team fights.

Try to catch him before a team fight starts."}
{"text": "As poppy, Keep ganking and counter ganking when possible. Your presence makes it very hard for the enemy to escape as they can't go near terrain.\n\nWork with your Support and invade the enemy Jungle when possible. This will allow you to easily set vision around, as well as get some picks.\n\nYou will want to make team fights unfair by picking off enemies when they are overextended or are playing carelessly.

This can make it hard for him to survive the laning phase, especially when he is up against a solid early game champion.\n"}
{"text": "Against gragas, Gragas can start ganking once he has access to all 3 core abilities. Keep this in mind and try to track him so you can counter gank at level 3.\n\nLike most champions, Gragas spikes again at level 6 as his Ultimate R is a really good tool when it comes to ganking. Expect him to gank overextended lanes whenever he is level 6.\n\nAlways keep an eye on what items he\u2019s buying. Gragas can go tank or can build a lot of AP. If he\u2019s going AP, respect his damage output."}

{"text": "Against aphelios, In addition, get away from the Tower if you are pushed under it like her AOE cars will hit you if you are behind the tower. Do not trade at level 1 with Aphelios if you play as champion AP. It is based AD and will do more damage than you early. Aphelios is subject to crowd control and all in. If possible, try to lock it as quickly as possible when you exchange to reduce its output damage. Aphelios is also super squishy and easy to kill, so it could even blow Flash when you try to commit."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax's objective control is excellent as his e allows him to CC multiple targets with ease. This is especially true in choke points like the objective pits.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive spike for Jax. This is due to the increased resistance he gets when he activates his Ultimate t. It will help him a lot when it comes to using his Passive and attacking consistently.\n\nJax's first item component will allow him to get an advantage over the enemy. It will increase his overall dueling potential and will completely dismantle the gameplan of any enemy who is overextended and hasn't set vision around the map."}

{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid grouping too closely if the enemy has multiple knock-ups as it will allow Yasuo to get a really good Ultimate R off. Grouping but not standing on top of each other will reduce the effectiveness of his Ultimate R.\n\nDo not fight inside the jungle as it will make it easier for Yasuo to land his Tornado r knock up and follow it up with his Ultimate R. Fighting in the open will make team fighting more effective for your team. \n\nCC is your best friend in team fights. Locking him down with CC will make it very difficult for him to stack his r, dash with E and inevitably use his Ultimate R. Try to CC him as quickly as possible and take him down."}
{"text": "As fiora, Grievous Wounds can counter her heavily as it reduces the healing (which is a huge portion of her dueling power). Since her early game is the point where she is the weakest, building such an item can be pivotal towards shutting her down.\n\nMisuse of her W can straight-up cost her the lane. Once that ability is down, she can be CC\u2019d to oblivion and gotten rid of quite easily. This is especially true if she dives into the enemy team.\n\nHer Ultimate R can be avoided easily if the enemy team disengages as soon as she places her Ultimate R on a member of her team. During the laning phase, Fiora\u2019s opponent can prevent her from proc\u2019ing her Passive by using the terrain to block the direction in which the Vital appears."}
{"text": "Against garen, Garen's construction path can be very different from one game to another. Keep an eye on its itemization and play according to what it buys. If it's in full damage, you probably haven't been able to fight it alone. It will be difficult for Garen to engage or start a team fight because it lacks hard CC. This means that he will try to flank in team fights with his Q. Make sure that you keep your side at all times and kite upside down as soon as it appears. Avoid losing valuable resources like Summoner Spells or Ultimates on Garen unless you are sure you are able to kill it. Garen can quickly complete his health bar full thanks to his Passive that will lead your team to lose on key spells for the rest of the fight."}
{"text": "As malphite, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "Against ksante, Remember that he can use his **W** to CC several enemies. Don=t group super tight together so he can't CC all your team. Look for fights when he doesn't have his **Ultimate** as he will be weaker and easy to kill. He likes to divide the thrust after the laning phase has finished. When he shows in a single side track, you can start a team fight with his teammates. Have quarters on this side of the map, however, if he makes his way to join the battle."}
{"text": "As kled, The all-in potential with his E and Q is really strong. It also allows him to set-up ganks for his Jungler and get free kills in the lane.\n\nKled\u2019s Passive is one of his greatest powers in a full-blown skirmish. He can use it to instigate tower dives and soak tower shots, while if he happens to take a lot of damage and get dismounted, he can easily get Skaarl back.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to initiate a team fight with ease. It can be used as an ability to score picks on immobile champions as well. The team movement speed increase makes sure that he generally gets sufficient follow-up."}
{"text": "As twitch, Use the track brushes and continue to land your k on the enemy. Once they have 3 piles of your passive, use your e. Your s should only be used when the Jungler is in the process of gloves or when you have decided to go into your ADC. Be very careful to get too close to your enemies. Make sure to continue stacking your support element regularly. In addition, you are entitled to a certain farm on the track provided your ADC is dead or has recalled with the wave to a bad place."}
{"text": "Against evelynn, Get wards down! Evelynn might be cloaked when walking but not when doing camps. Place vision on her jungle camps rather than inside lane bushes.\n\nEvelynn will look to execute someone before a team fight or an objective spawns. Do not move around the map alone whenever a major objective is about to spawn. Stay as a team if possible.\n\nKeep track of Evelynn\u2019s Ultimate R. When it\u2019s down, she is a lot less mobile and cannot escape skirmishes without using her Flash."}
{"text": "As jhin, Its immobility is its main weakness because it has a large target painted on its head because of this. If the enemy manages to catch it, it will die. Due to its passive, it is not really good against tanks, especially those who can put themselves on its face. It will take ages for it to get rid of a real tank. The Ultimate R root it in place. This allows the enemy both flank and concentrate it with ease."}
{"text": "As bard, Your use of Q and Ultimate R needs a lot of refinement when you just take the champion. That's because an Ultimate R moved from your end can lose you a whole team fight. Its skill curve is massive and is quite difficult to overcome. Getting caught with your E on the cooldown, especially during the start of the game, will get you killed. Moreover, if you continue roaming, the chances are that your ADC will fall massively behind and will get killed frequently, especially if you are in a low elo support."}
{"text": "As graves, Focus on farming early. You need time to come online, and you just need to focus on getting gold and XP.\n\nHowever, if you do find a ganking or counter-ganking opportunity nearby, don\u2019t be afraid to take it.\n\nIf they invade you early, just back off; you do not win early skirmishes with them.\n\nTry to secure those major objectives when you can, as you have decent objective control. You could gank bot, then take Drake afterwards."}
{"text": "As nunu, Really bad against the disengaged champions because he can't do anything to avoid being disturbed while using his W. Disengage and CC can also interrupt his Ultimate R, which can lead to much less damage to his end. The healing reduction can easily counter him during the early match. This will allow the enemy to take Targets quite easily after getting rid of Nunu as he won."}
{"text": "Against volibear, Buy items that provide Grevious Wounds like Executioner\u2019s Calling or Morellonomicon. This will prevent him from healing and surviving team fights.\n\nIn team fights, avoid grouping too closely as it will allow Volibear to get a great Ultimate R off. Group, but do not stand too close together.\n\nVolibear has great pick potential in the mid-game. Avoid going in unwarded parts of the map if you know Volibear is in the vicinity. "}
{"text": "As maokai, It's a tank against tank matchup. Your best bet is just to avoid them and focus on early farming. However, they are a stronger ganker than you in the game early, so be ready to counter-gank and follow them. If you can't get an advance of easy ganks, try to invade their jungle and steal their camps."}
{"text": "Against akali, Once Akali has finished her first article, her death pressure increases and her damage release too. Respect her total pressure once she has finished it. Akali is capable of champions all hardened at level 6 because she gets tons of mobility and damage thanks to her Ultimate. If she hasn't played aggressively before level 6, expect her to do so once she has reached the level. Try not to give Akali kills in the early game. She is a heavy snowball champion and once she has some gold under her belt, she can easily take the card."}
{"text": "As nilah, Its W blocks automatic attacks and improved automatic attack capabilities. This includes capabilities like Twisted Fate. Your passive helps you gain XP advantages over enemy tires, which can help you hit power spikes before them. Its E gives Nillah 2 dashes. It's good for it because it can quickly enter and exit skirmishes."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lisandra has to commit to an all-in in order to make use of her kit. This can be a problem if her team is not on the same page as her.\n\nHer Ultimate R is more of a utility tool rather than a damaging tool. This can be an issue against stronger mid lane champions.\n\nIf you\u2019re behind, you\u2019re going to deal no damage in team fights and your poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Do not let the enemy team have a fair team fight. You may be able to kill brushes in the enemy jungle with your Ultimate t. Also, keep an eye on the side tracks and see if you can go and kill an enemy who is recklessly pushed up in such a way. A defensive element should help you a lot when diving into an enemy team. If you are behind the game, move your attention to peeling for your team rather than making aggressive games."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ezreal's first power peak is when he takes Sheen. His Q damage will increase considerably and he will look to poke constantly. Once Ezreal has finished his Manamune and upgraded it to Muramana, his damage output and maintain will be much higher. Every time Ezreal has his E, it is much safer and harder to kill. Try to abuse cooldown whenever you can."}
{"text": "As syndra, Stay with your team in the late game. Do not separate or get away from them; otherwise, the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and on the positioning of your allies. You need to push the enemy down and delay fighting in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass."}
{"text": "Against milio, Lock him in the team fights. Make sure to hit him with your CC tools so he can't use his Ultimate to save his allies. Don't fight in the jungle vs Milio because the teams will be regrouped and if he's well positioned, he can easily counter your hard engagement. It's better to fight in the open and away from the goals and in tight parts of the map."}
{"text": "As shaco, Place your x boxes early in the track and inside the track brushes. This way you will be able to get a lot of poke damage on the carefree enemies. Roam a lot in this way and see if you can help your Jungler and mid-laner out. This will annoy the enemy team and tilt them massively. Once you get your Ultimate I, your roam frequency should increase considerably. Make sure you use this peak power to the maximum."}
{"text": "As lulu, Level 11 is when Lulu becomes a real problem to deal with for the enemy team. That's because his Ultimate R will now have two points and won't let her die easily. Lulu's efficiency in team fighting really comes into play during this phase of the game. His W and Ultimate R will help him face enemies who like to flance and reach his backline."}
{"text": "As karma, Karma's d will be maxed out at level 13. This means that she will be able to peel her teammates with ease and keep them out of troubles way.\n\nKarma will have multiple items completed during this stage of the game. This will allow her to dish out a lot of damage while peeling for her carries at the same time.\n\nHer damage output will be really high during the late game, which will allow her to poke enemies out relentlessly. She will make team fights really unfair for the enemy, especially around choke points."}
{"text": "As nautilus, If you constantly push the wave of minions, it will be difficult for you to play aggressively. The enemy can also zone you away from the farm and XP. Can easily be overturned by various champions in the way. Watching your positioning is the key when you play like this champion. Must commit to all in. If you go, you will be in a super-long position that could allow the enemy to turn the exchange and kill you."}
{"text": "As zoe, Its early enema is incomplete and it can be exploited quite easily due to the lack of mobility in its kit. Its loss of E will make it vulnerable, especially before it touches level 6. This will make it really weak against any enemy who has a dash or blinks in its kit. Quite vulnerable to the ganks when it is pushed up and has no spell because of its W. Once the crowd is controlled, it has no form of escape because its Ultimate R will only return it to the location of the original recast."}
{"text": "As kayle, It is important that you concentrate the closest enemy champion and your allies concentrate. Unless your ADC is behind you, you could use your Ultimate R on them to keep them alive while they take the damage. If you're ahead, keep your Ultimate R for yourself."}
{"text": "As ashe, At level 6, Ashe\u2019s kill pressure in the lane increases. Her Ultimate w is very versatile and can set up kills with her team. Make sure you play around your Ultimate w to get kills over and over.\n\nOnce Ashe has a few points in her y, her poke can be incredibly challenging to deal with. Make sure you harass the enemy as often as you can \n\nAfter your first back, you will pick up your first component item. The extra damage it provides will help you in extended trades with your Q, and increase your poke damage with your y. Start playing more aggressive after your first back."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Morgana is good at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Until then, her death pressure is not the best, but it increases once that ability unlocked. Once Morgana has Zhonyas Hurglass, her survival in team fighting will increase. Try to fight her when her Zhonyas is downstairs, so she is unable to defend herself. When Morgana has her Blackshield E available, it will be difficult for you to kill her because he can block CC and damage."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn will try to poke you at a safe distance. Don't stay entangled with minions, you'll get crushed massively. Quinn can try to wander post-six. Let your travelers know if it's missing, and see if you can put pupils in the river before. Stick to the track and force Quinn to wander by making the way completely dormant. Look only for all the in when your Jungler arrives. Keep the wave near the tower and focus on getting tankier in this game. Doing it can easily allow the enemy of you all-in."}
{"text": "As rengar, He is the public enemy number one for any squishy carry in the game. He can practically one-shot them with one or two items and can tilt someone hard enough to win the game easily.\n\nHis duelling power early on is really strong, especially if he is top lane and has access to the lane brushes. He can initiate a snowball this way, which can easily allow him to win games.\n\nHas good split pushing potential in the mid-game, and good assassination potential on squishy isolated targets."}
{"text": "Against lulu, In team fights, try to catch Lulu out of position or lock her down with CC. If you can take her down first, her ability to protect her carries will be lessened. If you can\u2019t kill her, you might be able to force herself to self-cast her Ultimate R.\n\nFor AD champions, invest in an Executioner's Calling when Lulu and her team is ahead. This will reduce her healing and shielding capability on her allies.\n\nForcing team fights when Lulu\u2019s Ultimate R is on cooldown is the best way to win fights as she will be unable to protect herself or her allies."}
{"text": "As ornn, Ornn can be really strong in early play when paired with a good ADC. However, his early play force depends on many different factors. His first major power peak is at level 6 when he unlocks his Ultimate R. At level 6, he can look for more aggressive games and set up his Jungler. When he finishes his first component element, he can look for more aggressive games and win more trades with the lower enemy track."}
{"text": "As lillia, Her first major power spike in the laning phase is when she hits level 6. She can set up ganks for her Jungler, or look for kills to get an early lead.\n\nWhen Lillia has completed her first component item, her damage output will heavily increase. She can look for more skirmishes with the enemy laner and will be able to trade frequently with them.\n\nBetween levels 4 and 5, she would\u2019ve put multiple points in her Q. Her damage output and trading ability will be quite strong during this time.\n"}
{"text": "As riven, Another point in its Ultimate e will significantly increase its damage. All it needs is its time well and use its multiple target r to CC. It will now have its basic elements which means that it will do a lot of damage. It should have an easy time to melt through the enemy health bars if it manages to catch them out of sight. Riven's presence during mid-game fighting is really fabulous. It should be able to win several battles and zone enemies easily using its Ultimate e."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine is an easy champion to learn. You don\u2019t need to spend as much time into learning her compared to someone like Akali or Camille.\n\nShe has a lot of CC thanks to her Passive, E and Ultimate R. She also has a heal and shield with her W. This makes her a great utility champion.\n\nHer Ultimate R has the potential to hit the whole enemy team. The more champions you hit too, the further it will go. If you\u2019re able to get a good Ultimate R off, you will increase your chances of winning the team fight."}
{"text": "As lillia, Continue playing around with your Ultimate R to get more kills and more picks. Picking off the right target can let you take the Baron or Dragon.\n\nKeep trying your hardest to secure objectives with your team so you can gain an overall advantage over the enemy.\n\nContinue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!        "}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 6, Ezreal will unlock its Ultimate R. Its Ultimate R is an excellent tool at all stages of the game. It allows it to inflict a considerable amount of damage to anyone on the card. After Ezreal on first return, it will recover its first component. Its release of damage will intensify and it can look for more aggressive parts once it has it. When Ezreal completes its Mythic element, its release of damage will increase again. A good Ezreal will seek to bring down the enemy with his Q before launching a whole."}
{"text": "As quinn, You may resort to split-pushing during the mid-game as it will allow you to gain solo XP and gold. Just make sure that you ward around yourself to keep you safe.\n\nMake sure that you use your E properly and timely in this matchup. The enemy will be trying to bait it out so don't do anything impulsively.\n\nYour Ultimate R can be a really good escape tool if you manage to use it out of vision. When pushing a wave, make sure that you have some safe spots around you to hide and run.        "}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Mordekaiser is quite immobile. If the enemy has lots of mobility or has dodge tools, it will be hard for him to catch up with the enemy.\n\nPre-6, if Mordekaiser misses his E, his ganks will fail. This is because he has no other forms of CC and it will be hard for him to get on to the fleeing target.\n\nIn the later parts of the game, pen and healing reduction will reduce his survivability heavily in late game team fights."}
{"text": "As nasus, Make sure that you use your Q to regularly kill the monsters. It is a surefire way to get multiple stacks and take over the game later on.\n\nIt would be preferable if you avoid any conflict and focus on stacking your Q up. It is a really safe way to get ahead in the game.\n\nEnsure that you put some vision around the Jungle entrances to check for invades. It will allow your team to collapse on the enemy should they decide to invade.        "}
{"text": "As twitch, You will also want to make sure that you continue cleaning the control guards on the map. During neutral objective fighting, you should close the Jungle paths from where the enemy is about to come. Your k should allow you to do it easily but drop it in one of the river entrance brushes. Protecting your ADC should be important but not going around your life for it. If your ADC has become a responsibility, don't hesitate to take things in hand."}
{"text": "Against lulu, Lulu's early game can be incredibly hard to play against if you are a melee champion. Opt for support and defensive statistics in the early game. Once Lulu has finished his first element, his protection and shielding ability will increase dramatically. At this stage, she will also make a huge amount of damage during trading. Team fights are where Lulu shines thanks to his E and Ultimate R that can be used on his allies."}
{"text": "As zed, The first item procurement will make Zed a deadly champion to deal with. He should be looking to roam to other lanes and clean up kills on low-health/overstaying enemies.\n\nLevel 3 is a decent power spike as Zed will now have access to his overall burst combo. He can quickly go for short burst trades and proc his runes with these abilities. He can spam them quite fast as well since he is not dependent on mana.\n\nLevel 6 is a significant power spike for Zed. This is where he unlocks his full potential and can make the plays and the moves to make enemies wonder what that was. He should also be able to dive low health enemies and escape unscathed."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, Ward your flanks like Mordekaiser can try to attack on the side to get on a high-value target with his Ultimate R. If Mordekaiser misses his E in a team fight, it would not be a bad time to focus it because he will be unable to shoot your team in when his E is on the cooldown. Avoid starting major goals like the Baron or a Dragon when Mordekaiser is nearby because he can take your Jungler into the Shadow Realm with his R that will make it take the risky goal."}
{"text": "Against khazix, Control of the crowd is a necessity when you play against Kha-Zix because it reduces his assassination and jumps the potential E. Try to lock Kha-Zix as soon as he jumps E to prevent him from entering and leaving. Grouping closely together will make it harder for Kha-Zix to inflict tons of damage as he will not get any damage bonus from his Passive when the targets are grouped."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan can look for an early aggressive game once he unlocks his Q and E. He can look for an aggressive game if he has been able to intimidate the enemy down to level 1. One Akshan has supported and recovered his first component element, his release of damage and his ability to trade increases. He should look for aggressive games once he has brought his first component element. Level 6 is good for Akshan. That's because he unlocks his Ultimate. He can help him kill and execute the enemy lantern."}
{"text": "As twitch, His e, when combined with his increase in attack speed is a strength to count with. He can get several early murders with this combo (and decent support if he is ADC). When in the jungle, the Red Buff can amplify the effects of this combo. His Ultimate c and Passive allow him to shred through the enemy team with ease when they find themselves grouped. This gives him a very strong advantage in the choking points. He can use his s to scrutinize and fix a vision for his team too."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, Force team fights when Shyvana doesn\u2019t have her Dragon t form so she is unable to effectively trade or fight back with your team.\n\nShyvana will try to delay a team fight so she can harass and poke you down with her l in Dragon t form. Fight as soon as you can so she is unable to burst you down and from afar.\n\nShyvana can flank from the side with her Ultimate t and her l. Make sure you have your flanks warded so you can see her before she gets the chance to poke and burst you down."}
{"text": "As quinn, She should try to abuse her lantern early with her basic abilities. Her W should provide her with a lot of vision while wandering around in an unrewarded territory. The increase in attack speed is very powerful, so. Her Q will come in very practical combats that occur in tight spaces. She can most likely land a blind five-men, which will be huge for her team."}
{"text": "Against zed, Zed\u2019s skirmishing power is very high early on. Keep this in mind when attempting to fight him in the very early game.\n\nWhen invading the enemy Zed, try and wait inside a bush or only go in on him when he is low on energy so he will find it hard to trade back with you.\n\nZed\u2019s early scuttle crab prowess is very strong. If you\u2019re weak at level 3, don\u2019t bother trying to contest the scuttle against him as he may probably kill you. The less gold Zed gets early- the better."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, If a Fiddlesticks predict suddenly ceases to have Tremors on Rek-Sai-Sense W, it is very likely that it channels its Rand, you should run out of the potential Fiddlesticks.

Moreover, Rek-Sai-Sai can easily be used to punish an immobile Fiddlesticks if he tries a gank. Avoid trying to invade Fiddlesticks unless you know where he is. You can win 1v1-S against him as he has many options of disengagement and can easily escape an invasion. Try to steal his camps when he is somewhere else on the map."}
{"text": "As diana, At level 9, Diana will max her Q. Her Q offers her a lot of extra wave clear and more poke in lane. She will be a real threat when she hits level 9.\n\nAt level 11, Diana will put the second point in her Ultimate R. It will be on a lower cooldown that allows her to go for more aggressive all-ins. With the lower cooldown comes additional damage. She will deal a lot of burst damage in the mid-game if she is ahead.\n\nAs Diana is an assassin, she will be able to pick off targets in the mid-game that are walking around the map alone. In particular, she can ambush the enemy Support as they try to ward upcoming objectives."}
{"text": "As veigar, He can easily start pulling people once he manages to get his first element. Extremely powerful when he fights in closed spaces as he can easily land his e and r on several targets while the crowd controlling them with his n. Very high potential to set up gank with his n. This can allow him to call his Jungler to gank his way and help him get an early lead, which will be pretty devastating for the enemy team."}

This means that he can look for picks and can quickly get kills on isolated targets.\n\nAt level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate t. This means that he will absorb more damage, completely dive the enemy backline, and still survive.        "}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 16, Ezreal will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will deal a lot of burst damage to anyone who is hit with it in the late game.\n\nWhen Ezreal is coming to completing his build, he will have incredibly low cooldowns on all of his abilities. This is good for him as he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight occurs. Also, his E will be on a short cooldown which allows him to escape skirmishes easily.\n\nEzreal is great in the mid-game, but he does start to fall of in the late game as it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}

{"text": "Against anivia, If it uses any ability on the minion wave to hit last, make sure that you abuse cooldowns. Don't forget Anivias Passive. It has a long cooldown, so once it's jumped, make sure you try to kill it when it's the most vulnerable. Call for help and ask for ganks while it's down.

If he uses them, try to abuse the cooldowns and look to trade with him while they\u2019re down.\n \nIf you\u2019re ranged, use your range advantage to harass him with basic attacks whenever he walks forward to last hit.

{"text": "As nami, Nami has a lot of poke thanks to her W and E. This can allow her to bring down the enemy and win trades with ease. She can also use her W to heal if a trade goes wrong. A lot of pressure to kill in the laning phase and in the middle of the match with her Q and Ultimate R. This makes her a huge threat in team fighting. Can keep her allies surmounted by HP thanks to her W and the items she will pick up. This increases her allies' ability to inflict damage and survive team fighting."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Having three points in his Ultimate R is a massive powerspike for Xin Zhao. This will allow him to use the ability frequently, giving him an overall benefit during fights.\n\nXin will have two of his abilities maxed out by level 14. This is a significant boost to his dueling power, and it will let him dominate 1 v 1's with utmost ease.\n\nDuring this phase of the game, Xin will be really tanky while simultaneously dealing a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that he will be tough to take down, and immobile or CC'd enemy carries will mostly die if they can't get Xin away from them."}
{"text": "As lux, You\u2019re weaker than them whenever they have their Ultimate up. If you\u2019re at risk of dying, always recall at level 5 so you do not get killed when they hit level 6.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re adjusting your positioning according to where Lux is standing in lane. They have the range advantage and if you\u2019re standing too far forward, they will harass you for free.\n\nKeep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them after they\u2019ve used an ability as they cannot use it to trade back with. Lux is less of a threat when they have an ability down.\n\nGood times to trade vs Lux is when they\u2019ve used one of their damaging abilities as they will lack damage to out trade you."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, If Wukong falls behind, it will be really difficult for him to get back into the game. Wukong expects to be a nuisance and get an early advance to take control of the card. Its there is his only real disengagement tool. Once it is down, or if he abuses it, his enemies can easily kill him in the way. If Wukong falls behind, he can build a tank, but he will only do little or no damage in a team fight. Keep this in mind, but be ready to adapt."}
{"text": "Against quinn, At level 1, don't let her intimidate you with her basic attacks. Unlike the other champions, Quinn's level 6 power peak does not offer her much in the way. But her Ultimate R offers her a lot of roaming potential. As soon as she reaches level 6 and disappears, communicator with your team to let them know that she is on the left. Once Quinn has finished her first element, her death pressure increases. If you are behind, avoid fighting her at all costs because she will probably beat you in 1v1."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Avoid fighting around the goals as Poppy can use his Ultimate R to shoot down the Jungler and cost your team the Baron/ Dragon. In team fighting, disengage and avoid team fighting in the jungle as this will allow Poppy to get a good boost with his Ultimate R or choose a key target with his E. Fighting around Poppys Ultimate R is a good way to win team fighting."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus is at his weakest in the game at first. Try to deny as many piles as possible so that he is unable to scale quickly. The more the game goes, the stronger Nasus gets. Make sure you finish the game as quickly as possible. Although he will focus on agriculture, once he has his Ultimate R, his death pressure will increase and his survival. Make sure you are not too cuckolded otherwise he can turn the exchange around."}

He may look for an aggressive play as soon as he gets the level up.\n\nWhen Xin has brought his first component item, he will be really strong in 1v1 skirmishes. Keep this in mind when trying to fight him.\n\nXin is very good in the mid-game. Expect him to frequently look for plays around the map, or look to kill you over and over again."}
{"text": "As camille, The mid-game should be focused on picking off the enemy laners and champions who are squandering about the map. Her potential to duel and pick off enemies should be capitalized on by her.\n\nNeutral objective fights will have to be dealt with differently. Camille should always try to get into the enemy backline by using the fog of war to her advantage during such fights. This is mainly because she doesn't have any consistent AoE DPS ability in her kit.\n\nHer core items should allow her to take up any fight without significant hindrance. She should be focusing on ganking her laners frequently to help them accumulate a lead during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "As amumu, As Amumu has 2 s\u2019s, he can easily catch out one of the enemy laners as they walk outside of \n\nAmumu\u2019s first power spike is when he unlocks his Ultimate y. Hitting level 6 is crucial, and you need to hit it as early as possible to help your allies.\n\nOnce Amumu has completed his first item, he will be much more robust and more of a menace on Summoners Rift. Make sure you find a healthy balance between ganking and farming to not delay your first item."}
{"text": "As zeri, Unique Mechanic with his Q and the basic attacks. This can be difficult to master. She is pretty weak from behind, but again are many other champions.

You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Use the track brushes to regularly land your e on the enemy. This will soon allow you to cut your enemy off the track. Your e must be used with extreme discretion in this matchup. Make sure the enemy has no form of CC on them before deciding to use the ability in the middle of a fight, Once you unlock your Ultimate r, you should have a really easy time running down not only in your way but also in other ways. Make sure you do everything you need to get a lead."}
{"text": "As akshan, The early game should be mainly focused on taking short trades against the enemy with your automatic and passive attacks. Do not go for a prolonged trade unless the primary ability of the enemy is on the cooldown. If you succeed in pushing the wave in, try to ride with your W. If it happens that the side travellers enemies are low, you can quickly E in and get some killed. Your Ultimate will help you a lot in this game, but make sure you position properly. Remember that you can use the ability while you are E'ing, so make sure you don't stay still while it is locked."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 11 is not a massive peak of power because it provides it with nothing but a lower cooling. It will allow it to get a lot of backdrops. Its first capacity will be maximized to level 9. This will allow it to flatten a lot of damage during the duels that will be advantageous against the squishy targets. Its team combat potential is really high because it can do a lot of damage based on the AoE. Its C and E should come in very practical."}
{"text": "Against twitch, AP Support Twitch has power peaks similar to ADC Twitch. Keep this in mind, especially around the level power peaks. Once Twitch has finished Lich Bane, its damage release and burst damage increase dramatically. Be careful to play the cheesey with its s as it might seek to kill you once you return to the track. At level 6, Twitch will unlock its Ultimate c. It offers it a lot of additional death pressure in the track."}
{"text": "Against shaco, Shaco can assassinate targets in the middle of the game. Make sure you stay on the team so that it can't take anyone down. Once Shaco is level 6, its ability to solo the Dragon or Rift Herald increases thanks to its Ultimate I. Make sure you keep these goals monitored so you can spot it before it takes them."}
{"text": "As leona, After level 6, it is important to stay attached to your ADC because Leona can easily integrate and engage with you if you are separated. Watch out for Leona's E (Zenith Blade) cooling. Take advantage of the opportunity to detach your ADC when she is wasting her E, allowing you to booze or reposition safely. Keep the wave closer to your turret to limit Leona's all-in potential. This provides a safer position for you and makes it harder for Leona to engage with you and your ADC. If Leona errs, focus on punishing the enemy CDA by trying to get a murder or apply pressure. Leona is known for her roaming potential, so anticipate her frequently leaving the way."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio should be getting his build completed by now. This will give him a massive spike in his ability to peel for the allied carries. His damage output will be pretty high as well.\n\nGalio's Ultimate R will still be handy during fights due to its knockup and low cooldown. He can easily split push and show up to fights with his Ultimate R in a jiffy.\n\nLevel 16 isn't that big a spike for Galio. Although his Ultimate R cooldown is reduced and the cast range is increased, he won't have any incentive to use it for himself."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Once level 6, Maokai\u2019s kill pressure in lane will increase. At this time, he might start getting ganks as his Ultimate R is a great tool for initiating ganks.\n\nAt level 3, Maokai can start to play more aggressive as he will have access to all his basic abilities.\n\nMaokai is good in team fights as his Ultimate R has a large area of effect. Make sure you split up or disengage as soon as you see him so he is unable to utilise this ability."}

Deny his surprise engages by warding around your team.\n \nSeek fights when Fiddlestick\u2019s R is on cooldown because with it down his team fighting potential decreases a lot.\n \nDo not group to closely together when dancing with the enemy.

But don\u2019t over force it as he has a lot of burst damage.\n\nGragas can tease an engage when his Body Slam E is up. Try and stand behind or near minions at all times. However, do not stand too close to them since the ability does have an AOE and if you\u2019re close to them, you\u2019ll be hit by his E.\n\nIf Gragas uses his W, it\u2019s because he wants to do something such as setting up his Jungler or going for a trade.

{"text": "As drmundo, Dr Mundo\u2019s main power spike during the early game is when he reaches level 6. His Ultimate R offers him a lot of additional protection, and the additional movement speed it provides will make it hard for the enemy laner to escape from his ganks.\n\nMundo can start ganking from level 3 onwards. While his Q doesn\u2019t deal a lot of damage in the early game, the slow it provides is very handy when it comes to ganking his allies.\n\nOnce Dr Mundo has completed his first item, his damage output and overall tankiness will increase. At this stage of the game, his duelling ability and kill pressure will be very high."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cass is a monster at the end of the game. As long as she is not late, she will be incredibly strong in the end of the game. At level 13, Cass goes to max on her Q. By associating this with her max E, she will be able to do a lot of damage in a skirmish. At level 16, Cassiopeia will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will do a lot of damage, stun the enemy for a long period of time, be on a short cooldown and have the potential to win his team the game."}
{"text": "Against karthus, If you see Karthus channeling his e, try to cancel it with any CC capability. This will reduce his chances and his allies to get killed.

{"text": "Against lulu, When playing melee champions, do not let Lulu bully you down with auto-attacks. When you\u2019re not looking to engage, stand back so she cant auto-attack you. \n\nWaiting for Lulu to use her E before fighting or poking is a good way of coming out ahead. Try to bait this ability out and then play aggressive while it\u2019s on cooldown.\n\nPost 6 and when Lulu gets her Ultimate R, her survivability increases a lot. Keep in mind that it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to kill her when her Ultimate R is up. Do not commit to the all-in unless it\u2019s down or she\u2019s out of mana."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, His early play is quite decent because he can simply go for coherent jobs and return to safety because of his y. He will not take much damage either with the proper use of this ability. The first element is a decent peak because it strengthens his survival and damage. He will help him to take the track easily. Level six is a massive peak because he can now impact team fighting overall. He can also look for flanks and dive the enemy rear line."}
{"text": "As xerath, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As maokai, Once Maokai's Ultimate R is exhausted, the enemy will not have a perfect time in the game. Maokai's team will quickly capitalize on its CC, however. Its tankness is massive during the last game. His Passive will not let him die while he plunges the enemy's rear line, inflicts damage on them, and ensures that they cannot join the fight. He is decent during late fighting like his W, and Q can easily CC a high priority target and prevent them from fighting. This gives his allies time to damage the other enemies or collapse on target CC'd."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Track brushes must be used a lot of time when you are trying to land your C and E on the enemy. It will easily allow you to disrupt the fighting with ease. Always use your Q in the middle of the track. It will give you more area to dodge and you will be able to hit most of the shards on the enemy. After six, you should be able to block enemies from escaping or entering the river during neutral objective fighting. Make sure to use it properly although otherwise you might very well end up dying."}
{"text": "As orianna, Orianna is a very mechanically difficult champion to master. It will take a lot of practice to play her to her full potential. Don't hurt us, she's easy to pick up. Orianna is quite motionless in the first parts of the game. If she grows, she can be susceptible to enemy Jungler ganks. Make sure that when you push, reposition or have a vision around your way. Quite vulnerable to all-in-one and difficult to engage in team fights. If she gets caught out of position, she will die instantly."}

{"text": "As kalista, Its r should be stacked and used only when a murder is guaranteed. Kalista's Ultimate x can be very practical during this stage of the game. It can come out of the vision with its Ultimate x activated, and allow its Support to immediately get to the top of other laner/laners. In short, it can better wander once its wave is pushed up. Fighting in open areas should be its modus operandi. This will give it additional power because it can use her Passive to kite the enemy team. A CC'ed Kalista is a dead Kalista."}

Once the target is hit, it will allow him and his streetlights to reach the automatic range of the target as long as they have a vision. Ivern has a decent objective control post 6 due to Daisy.

He will both be able to sustain himself, as well as deal hefty amounts of consistent damage.\n\nLucian's Q and E will be maxed out during this game stage.

Combined with her W, her allies will be pretty healthy during the game.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow her to use the ability quite frequently and dish out a lot of damage at the same time. It will be great during clumped fights.\n\nShe is outstanding in late-game fights due to her overall utility and CC on her Q. That CC can easily be chained with her Ultimate R for maximal effectiveness."}

This way, you will be able to get a lot of poke damage off on careless enemies.\n\nRoam a lot in this lane and see if you can help your Jungler and mid-laner out. This will annoy the enemy team and will tilt them massively.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate l, your roam frequency should increase drastically.

If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}

To work around this, either look to roam or use your t from an unwarded bush to engage.\n\nRell is very immobile when she is dismounted. This makes her incredibly vulnerable when she is dismounted t.\n\nIf you\u2019re behind, it\u2019s going to be impossible for you to get a good Ultimate R or t off as you\u2019ll be too squishy and die as soon as you go in."}

Expect him to look for or force ganks once his Ultimate R is up."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac's level 6 is a decent power spike for both team fights and duel. It will allow him to displace key targets while also dealing damage which can be highly beneficial when dealing with low health or squishy targets.\n\nAdding more points in his W will allow Zac to deal more damage in the long run. This is beneficial in the top lane as it deals percentage max health damage, and the top lane is generally occupied by high HP targets.\n\nThe first item component will give Zac a lot of power and survivability in the lane. He will also have access to the lane brushes, which will provide him with the element of surprise, and the enemy will have to play with a constant fear of being all-in'd."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana is very weak before-6, and you are much stronger than her. Go and invade her and try to fight her to deny her gold and XP. Post 6, it will be harder to fight her alone, so keep this in mind if you want to play aggressively. Try gank as often as you can early. You are much stronger than her and can get a lead just by being active on the card. Don't forget Shyvana. Make sure you take these Dragons away from her whenever possible."}

Both of them are beneficial to Shen and his team.\n\nHis tankiness will be prominent during this phase of the game. Combined with his W and Q, that will make it really hard for the enemy to kill him.\n\nLevel 9 is when his first ability will get maxed.

When Lillia finished her first component element, her damage production will increase sharply. She can look for more skirmishes with the enemy lantern and will be able to exchange frequently with them. Between levels 4 and 5, she would have put several points in her Q. Her production of damage and trading ability will be quite strong during this period."}
{"text": "As karma, Karma's d will be maximized at level 13. This means that she will be able to peel her teammates easily and keep them out of the trouble path. Karma will have several articles completed during this stage of the game. This will allow her to flatten a lot of damage while peeling for her aircraft carriers at the same time. Her release of damage will be really high during the end of the game, which will allow her to tear off the enemies unabated. She will make the team fights really unfair for the enemy, especially around the bottlenecks."}
{"text": "Against gangplank, In team fights, try to destroy his Barrels E before he can blow them up. This will reduce his AOE damage and his ability to win fights. Try to avoid fighting in areas that are tight as around the goals or in the Dragon that his Ultimate R will hit your entire team. Fight in the tracks rather than in the jungle and make sure you are not grouped closely together. Every time Gangplank has his Ultimate R, ping your team so they know that it can impact skirmishes."}

Capitalise on this to get yourself free kills.\n"}

This is especially true if she is going for the AD build.\n\nCan\u2019t be very effective if the enemy sets proper vision around and can notice Neeko changing her forms or hiding in a brush to land her E.\n\nDue to her pushing power, she can be very susceptible to ganks especially after she has used up her W."}
{"text": "As ziggs, The first component of Ziggs will give it a boost and mana pool. It will allow it to frequently use its Q to continue to hit the enemy and force them to remember abruptly. Level 6 is a massive power peak for Ziggs because it has access to a finishing capacity that is AoE in nature. It can also use it to help teammates finish targets while wandering around. Its Q is really heinous, and it just becomes more powerful by adding points to that ability. This will allow it to burst the enemies quickly, and it will push the wave quickly. This will allow it to sit its enemy tower languish."}

If he is laning against a tank Support, he can steal their stats and be incredibly tanky."}
{"text": "As zeri, Zeri's first power peak is at level 3 when it unlocks each of its basic capabilities. It will be relatively strong at level 3. Its next power peak will usually be once it unlocks its first component element because it allows it to go for more favorable trades with the enemy lantern. At level 6, Zeri will unlock its Ultimate R. It is a good peak for Zeri and it will allow it to win all in even in the hardest matchups."}
{"text": "As janna, Move towards the medium track and stay with your ADC in the medium track or shake hands with your Mid laners to prevent the enemy from taking the medium track level 1. Make sure to place the vision around the nearby tracks and targets. If you can spot the enemy moving around the map, your team may be able to collapse on them and get a free murder. Avoid moving too far away from your allies at any time. If you get caught out, the enemy may be able to take a nearby goal like Baron, Dragon, a tower or even win a 5v4."}

At level 6, Ashe=s kills the pressure in the track increases. Her Ultimate w is very versatile and can set up kill with her team. Make sure you play around your Ultimate w to get killed again and again. Once Ashe has taken her first component, her jobs will be extremely powerful.

{"text": "As sion, Its tankness will be really high during this phase of the game due to its articles. This, combined with its W, will make it almost indestructible and will allow it to absorb a lot of damage. A completely exhausted maximum Ultimate R will further strengthen its all-in-all potential and the overall damage inflicted in the long term. It will be a massive peak of power for it because it can ensure easy choices with it. It is great during the fighting of the team of the end of the game due to its Q and Ultimate R. Its efficiency increases if it manages to find a flank on its enemies or land its Ultimate R on a group of enemies stuck together."}

{"text": "As heimerdinger, If the enemy team focuses on destroying its Q turrets before invading it, it will have to play defensively until it can bring back its turrets. Missing its E will put it in a vulnerable place, especially if it is laning on its own or when it is pushed upwards. This error can easily cause it to kill. It is very effective when fighting in closed spaces like the Jungle. The enemy can reduce this by fighting in the tracks and then matching its thrust if he tries to divide the thrust."}

Also, keep an eye on the side lanes and see if you can go and kill an enemy who is carelessly pushed up in such a lane.\n\nA defensive item should help you a lot when diving into an enemy team.

By associating this with her max E, she will be able to do a lot of damage in a skirmish. At level 16, Cassiopeia will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will do a lot of damage, stun the enemy for a long period of time, be on a short cooldown and have the potential to win his team the game."}

At this stage, his kill pressure also increases.\n\nKassadin is a later game monster and once he\u2019s level 16, he will be very slippery thanks to his Ultimate k and short cooldowns.

The second point of his Ultimate R will allow him to do more damage with the ability. It is necessary to make sure that he throws the target in the right direction. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to inflict massive amounts of damage during the ganks and mid-game fights."}

Avoid separating or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you are gone. Play around your Ultimate t in the later parts of the game.

Teemo is not really a massive threat, but make sure you remove it from every chance you get in this matchup.

That's what makes him really good with champions who have hard CC or slowed down in their arsenal. He can continue to make regular short trades with his self-attacks and Q.

Provides a lot of vision with its E, which also makes room for the control of the brush. Combine its slow E with its W, it can practically choose a target and CC for a while while while its team has just followed it."}

This is highly valuable when trying to take out a group of three or more champions, especially when the enemy team is unaware of your position.\n\nPossibly one of the best flankers in the game.

You will be able to look for peaks frequently and you will also be able to get your second bup after landing or missing your first. In the late game, Blitzcrank would be almost complete. It should be very tanky and offer his team a lot of utility. Keep in mind that it will still be vulnerable and still, but it will be able to absorb more damage."}

Keeping the beach with your Q and Umbral Dash can allow you to inflict damage while preventing his engagement. Pantheon has very hard power-spikes at levels one to three. Be careful and watch what minions are dead and play safely until you have your ability to fight.

She will do a lot of brilliant damage in the middle of the game if she is ahead. Since Diana is a murderer, she will be able to choose targets in the middle of the game that walk on the map alone. In particular, she can ambushed the enemy Support as they try to protect the upcoming goals."}

As your team will be grouped closely, he will be able to land devastating blows with his s and that could cost you your team the goal and your lives.

{"text": "As zac, You should be a part of neutral objectives as your Ultimate R will allow you to disrupt fights easily. Your Q can let you kill enemies who decide to come through choke points.\n\nAlways make sure that you are peeling for your carries during the fight. Your tankiness and Passive should allow you to do so very easily.\n\nSet up engages by using the fog of war relentlessly. This will allow you to pick off enemies who are aimlessly wandering through their Jungle.        "}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Putting the second point in Fiddlesticks Ultimate R at level 11 is very important for him. It will put his Ultimate R on a shorter cooldown and allow him to look for more aggressive plays.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Fiddlesticks should\u2019ve completed an item or two. His damage output will be quite high which can allow him to win mid-game team fights.\n\nIn the mid-game, teams start to group. This is good for Fiddlesticks as he benefits from teams grouping closely together as his Ultimate R is an AOE tool."}
{"text": "As riven, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "As zyra, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As neeko, Keep using your Q and E to poke the enemy out. You may work with your Support and use the lane brushes to get as many picks on the enemy.\n\nWhen using your E, try to get both minions and the enemy with it. It will help you waveclear and empower the ability at the same time.\n\nOnce you get your first item, your burst damage will be really high. Just make sure that you don't get CC'd during a major all-in else you will definitely end up dying."}
{"text": "As graves, His first ability will be maxed out at level nine, which will help Graves bolster his overall burst damage in the Jungle. His clears and ganks will be more effective as a result.\n\nDue to his items, he will have a lot of kill pressure during the mid-game. His e and e will also let him catch enemies off-guard, and he can kill them very quickly due to his Passive.\n\nAt level 11, Graves will have two points in his Ultimate t. It means that the potential of that ability finishing off low health enemies increases drastically, especially if he is going for the lethality build."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Once Fiddlesticks has his Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass, it allows his R to really hit home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonya\u2019s, you can\u2019t attack him when he goes into stasis.\n\nWhen Fiddlesticks gets access to 3 abilities, he is really difficult to deal with because they offer him so much utility. If you\u2019re trying to go for an all in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing.\n\nOf course, Fiddlesticks biggest power spike is his level 6. You can counter it by having constant wards around your lane. If he goes missing post 6, ping your teammates."}
{"text": "Against akshan, The first power peak of Akshan is when he unlocks the 3 basic abilities. Although, his early play damage is pretty good at level 1 and 2. When he unlocks his Ultimate at level 6, his death pressure increases. Keep this in mind and avoid staying in the way when weak. After Akshans first return, he should have taken a component element for his Myth. Unless you've matched him, be careful because he will win jobs and all-in."}
{"text": "As graves, Group with your allies. Do not leave their side in the late game otherwise the enemy will have the advantage of numbers. Be ready to peel for your allies in the team fights. You are a strong skirmisher, but you should concentrate the closest enemy to keep your allies alive for longer. Look for peaks in the late game with your team. You have good tracking damage, so look for games with your allies to win the advantage of numbers."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Has to powerfarm early game and hence has no impact unless the enemy overextends or overstays. He will mainly focus on cleaning up during the early game.\n\nHis e can easily be interrupted by any form of hard CC. This can make tower dives risky and can get him killed almost instantly if he doesn\u2019t use the ability properly.\n\nCan\u2019t do much if the enemy team just disengages when his Ultimate r is active. Very susceptible to CC, so if the enemy saves their CC for him, he will die."}
{"text": "As lucian, Very vulnerable when his E is down which can allow him to be very susceptible to ganks. Enemy Junglers can take this opportunity to camp him relentlessly.\n\nReliant on items to win the game. If he is set back during the early game, he won\u2019t be able to do a lot in the late game as he just falls off.\n\nIf he manages to get an early lead, he may be able to snowball if left unchecked. He falls off massively though so the longer the game goes, the worse it is for Lucian."}
{"text": "As lux, Really good burst potential with her entire g, l, Ultimate n combo. This can delete a squishy enemy with ease starting from level six itself.\n\nHer e shield is deceptively strong as it can allow her to save all her team members from a lot of poke. This is also applicable when she is Support.\n\nHer g can be used to secure picks inside the enemy Jungle or from blind areas. This can be extremely beneficial if the picked target happens to be the enemy Jungler or the ranged carry."}
{"text": "As lucian, Once Lucian unlocks his 3rd stage Ultimate R, he will be able to bring tons of constant damage, especially to low health targets. This will make it easier for him to break up enemies. Lucian will have access to several articles during this stage of the game. He will be able to both support himself, as well as provide high amounts of constant damage. Lucian Q and E will be maximized during this stage of the game. It will allow him to systematically and will allow him to reposition himself frequently."}
{"text": "As morgana, During the laning phase, focus on the descent of the enemy to gain a health benefit. When the enemy is low, engage in an all-in. Look for pro-Q peaks and trades. Use your Q only if you are guaranteed to hit it. If you throw it and miss it, you will have no pressure in the track and will be rather vulnerable. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle lane and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Improper usage of his W can get him killed in the lane. This is especially true against ranged matchups. The alternative is to back off, which allows the enemy to just zone Yasuo off the wave.\n\nVery vulnerable to crowd control as it prevents him from casting his E for a while. He can\u2019t cast E on the same target twice, so he can easily be caught out.\n\nAlthough a power house, he is very squishy and can easily be burst down if he happens to mis-step. This can happen quite a lot if he is pushing the sidelanes, and overextends."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ezreal\u2019s first power spike is when he picks up Sheen. His Q damage will increase substantially and he will look to constantly poke. \n \nOnce Ezreal has completed his Manamune and upgraded it to Muramana, his damage output and sustain will be much higher.\n \nWhenever Ezreal has his E, he is much safer and harder to kill. Try to abuse the cooldown whenever you can."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Once she has 2 points in her Ultimate e, she will easily be able to take over team fights and disrupt them as well. Her positioning will be the defining factor from now.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will significantly boost her damage and will let her one-shot squishies.\n\nMiss Fortune excels at team fights. This is due to her Ultimate e and Passive combined with her kiting potential. She just needs some peeling to become a demon in team fights.        "}
{"text": "As sylas, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Stay with your team at the end of the game. Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "As chogath, Cho\u2019Gath has almost unlimited sustain thanks to his Passive in lane. Just make sure you land the last hit on minions so you get the health back!\n\nHis e has a very large range. This makes it easier for him to land and CC. The only problem is that it can be difficult for him to land it against champions with dashes or escape tools.\n\nCho\u2019Gath is a strong scaler with a versatile build path. This means that he is great in the later stages of the game regardless of how ahead or behind he was in the earlier stages of the game."}
{"text": "Against lulu, When playing melee champions, do not let Lulu bully you down with auto-attacks. When you\u2019re not looking to engage, stand back so she cant auto-attack you. \n\nWaiting for Lulu to use her E before fighting or poking is a good way of coming out ahead. Try to bait this ability out and then play aggressive while it\u2019s on cooldown.\n\nPost 6 and when Lulu gets her Ultimate R, her survivability increases a lot. Keep in mind that it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to kill her when her Ultimate R is up. Do not commit to the all-in unless it\u2019s down or she\u2019s out of mana."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Do not regroup closely when you sit with a goal or a combat team because it gives Gragas the opportunity to hit your entire team in his own with his Ultimate R. When you fight, make sure you're not too forward or get away from your team. If you're too forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught like this could lead the enemy to take a goal soon after. You can often tell Gragas is nearby when Predator starts running. As soon as you see the marker, step back to security so you don't get killed."}
{"text": "As quinn, Investing in early armor will be very beneficial against her basic attacks in the laning phase.\n\nYour level 6 power spike is much stronger than hers, don\u2019t be afraid to play aggressive when you get the level up.\n\nPre-6, keep the wave closer to your side of the map. It will prevent Quinn from zoning you away from farm and will it\u2019ll allow you to play aggressive and look for kills.\n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about baiting out her E before looking to fight. Many Quinn\u2019s will use their E while your mid-combo actually counter themselves and get themselves killed. Keep this in mind when fighting.\n"}
{"text": "As rammus, Rammus has really good ganks once he has unlocked his t . He should have a high success rate when ganking his allies.\n\nThanks to his l, Rammus is incredibly tanky. This means he can always be the frontline that his team needs regardless of how far or behind he is.\n\nRammus\u2019 Ultimate 2 is on a short cooldown and can be used to get picks. This will allow you to gank a lane, push and then attempt to take the tower. "}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Your Ultimate e makes you unkillable for a period of time. This makes it hard to kill you which can provide you time to kill the enemy.\n\nIs incredibly mobile which allows him to escape sticky situations, waste the enemies time and outplay the enemy too.\n\nTryndamere is a great split pusher and duelist. He can 1v1 most enemy champions in a side lane during the mid game."}
{"text": "As neeko, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss out on extra damage and CC.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As lulu, Her last game is phenomenal since she can peel for her team for days. No one can get close to her team as long as her W and Ultimate R are in place. Lulu's Ultimate R at level 16 is a strength to count with. It will be difficult for the enemy team to eliminate Lulu's team due to the short cooling period of the ability, and killing Lulu will really be next to impossible. Lulu will be fully built by then in the game. Her shielding potential will be out of the world, and she can allow her entire team if she manages to use her abilities properly."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce is really good at bringing down the enemies with his combo w > s. He can even targets at a single shot if he is well ahead of the enemy team. This will allow him to create an advantage for his team before a major fight. Once Jayce is complete, no squishy enemy target in the game is sure. That's because he can easily blow up the enemies with his combo w > s. Sometimes, a single combo is all it takes to kill a target (such as a squishy support, for example). Jayce will not point to level 16 either because his Ultimate G will not provide with much raw statistics, what the ultimate champions offer them. He will always have to rely on flanking and use the fog of the war to bring down the enemies. The more the number of enemies affected, the better it is for his team and him."}
{"text": "As ornn, The final point in his Ultimate R will grant him a massive spike, and he will be able to dish out tons of damage to the enemy. Since the ability will be up frequently, he will be able to easily pick off targets with his team.\n\nOrnn is really great during team fights as he can peel for his team and set up picks for them when required. Any dispute near terrain will be favorable for him.\n\nHis tankiness will be phenomenal during this phase of the game. Combined with his deceptive damage, it will become tough to deal with him for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Stand behind minions at all times to minimize Q damage from Taliyah.\n\nBait out her W before engaging to avoid getting knocked back.\n\nHer level 6 allows her to counter your roams, so consider roaming from the base instead.\n\nAvoid standing in the minion wave after she gets her first item to reduce the damage taken from her pushing."}
{"text": "Against jayce, Jayce will try to delay a team's fight as long as possible so that he can fight with his s and w combo. Do not delay team fights at any cost so that he can't shoot you down. Don't try to take goals like the Baron or Dragon when Jayce is nearby. As your team will be grouped closely, he will be able to land devastating blows with his s and that could cost you your team the goal and your lives. If Jayce is in a side lane pushed by division, make sure to keep an eye on his positioning at all times. He can quickly erase the waves and take-off towers with his d. Don't leave him uncontested for too long."}
{"text": "As irelia, Prone to CC once she goes in. This is lethal for her if the enemy team has layered CC, or if she delves too deep into the enemy team and has no form of follow up from her team.\n\nHer Q usage needs a lot of practice and awareness. If mistimed, that ability will go on cooldown and she won\u2019t be able to do much if she isn\u2019t close to her target. This will also make her prone to CC.\n\nLanding her Ultimate R on ranged carries can be a grueling task, especially if the enemy has some form of dash. Once her Ultimate R is down, her all-in potential goes down by a bit as the enemy can kite her out."}
{"text": "As malphite, Try to hit level three as quickly as you can. It will give you a boost in your clearing speed, but your ganks will pretty much remain non-existent till you are level six.\n\nSince your early clears are pretty weak, you will want to make sure that you don't get invaded. Ward the Jungle entrances so that you can detect any invaders coming towards you.\n\nUnlocking your Ultimate h will give you the ability to freely gank from now on. Ensure that you don't let enemies push up in their lanes without being punished from now on.        "}
{"text": "Against kayle, Kayle is really weak in the beginning of the game. Try to abuse her as much as possible so she is forced to retreat early and delay her first major power peak. Once Kayle touches level 6, she will become varied and get a lot of extra protection thanks to her Ultimate R. You must always consider her Ultimate R by trying to fight her position level 6. As Kayle becomes stronger than the game goes, you really need to finish the game as quickly as possible. If you can't finish the game and it arrives at the end of the game, you will find it difficult to win."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Fortunately, he will not have this problem at the end of the game and will now remove many enemies with his E. Adding another point to his Ultimate R will give his powers more global strength. It can be practical by taking neutral goals and fighting enemies who rely on diving and lock Heimerdinger down. Heimerdinger will have a lot of articles now, and his abilities can easily a-shot enemies if they are not careful or if Heimerdinger puts a death brush somewhere. He can also take on the Baron alone."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Make sure you're close to your team at all times so you can fight quickly. After your bot track has moved to the medium track, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to close and win XP. As you're good at getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambushed and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Rift Summoners alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby goal."}
{"text": "As olaf, Look to take down the enemy carries. Focus the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them with your other frontline champions.\n\nAs you\u2019re the Jungler, you need to make sure you\u2019re always alive in the late game. If you die before a major objective spawns, the enemy will be able to take it.\n\nMake sure you are always on the side of the map that the next major objective is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show yourself, the enemy will take the objective for free."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton is an early game bully. Expect him to play aggressive and go for kills. Once he is level 3, he gets his first major power spike and can easily force a Flash. Expect this and play respectfully.\n\nOnce Renekton is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate t, he can be really aggressive and kill you. If you\u2019re low, recall and avoid pushing the wave if he\u2019s ahead as he can all-in you while you\u2019re overextended.\n\nAfter Renekton has completed his first item, his kill pressure also increases. Avoid trading or duelling him unless you\u2019re ahead."}
{"text": "As viego, Just focus on farming while keeping the wave on your side of the lane. You do not want to overextend, as you will definitely be ganked.\n\nYou should go for short burst trades when possible. Use your E on the side walls to ensure that you can use the stealth function to escape sticky situations.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should look to fight more often. Just make sure you warm up properly; else, you will most probably get ganked."}
{"text": "As malphite, A maximum of **Ultimate** will allow Malphite to flatten large amounts of burst damage. Ennemy squishies will have a heinous moment in the game. It is solid during the fighting at the end of the game as his **Q** and **Ultimate** will hit like a truck now. All he needs to do is wait for the perfect moment. Depending on the construction for which he is going, he will either blow enemies on the whole map or a reliable linear front for his allies. Anyway, his goal is to enter the enemy backline and separate the front line from the backline."}
{"text": "As warwick, Warwick\u2019s weak early on, but once he gets some levels under his belt, he can be a real pain for the enemy laner.\n\nAt level 6, Warwick can go for more aggressive plays and shut down the enemy laner. He can also use his Ultimate R to help his allies in other lanes.\n\nOnce Warwick has a few points in Q, his sustain in the lane will help him even in the toughest of matchups. He will also be able to trade more effectively in the lane\n"}
{"text": "Against samira, In team fights, lock her down with CC at the start of the fight so she is unable to dish out damage. CC will also stop her Ultimate R prematurely, so try to lock her down quickly if she uses her E.\n\nSamira will often be left alone in the mid lane to farm during the mid-game. You could use this as an opportunity to catch her and her Support out of position and force an objective afterwards.\n\nTry to force fights as soon as you spot Samira or when she is on low Style points. Delaying a fight will allow her to get Style points and keep them for the upcoming team fight."}
{"text": "As fizz, Fizz is an incredibly weak champion up to level 3. If he gets shot, he won't be able to look for an all-in early or the first blood. Even if he's incredibly mobile with his E, when he's on the cooldown, he's incredibly squissy and still. Even with his E available, he's pretty squishy if he gets hit with CC. Fizz has to go ahead early to do well in the last stages of the game. If he loses the track or doesn't have a lot of gold, he won't be much threat in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As skarner, It is prone to CC and can be locked quite easily. It can be difficult for it to engage and be useful when it is interrupted easily. Skarner is not great if it is behind, because it will not be tanky enough to absorb damage, and it will not suffer much damage either. If enemy teams separate completely, it can be difficult for it to be super effective. The enemy front line could block its Ultimate, and Skarner should avoid using its Ultimate on the enemy front line."}
{"text": "As nautilus, He can start ganking as soon as he hits level 2. Don\u2019t be afraid to go for a level 2 gank in one of your lanes.\n\nYour Ultimate e is an insane tool that can help you get kills. Gank as soon as your Ultimate e is off cooldown as it will usually result in easy kills.\n\nNautilus has the most CC of any champion in League of Legends."}
{"text": "As sion, If he goes to another way, just push the wave and get as many plates as you can in this matchup. This is especially true if he uses his ult. During the fighting, watch for occasions to flank the enemy. Going to his back will be relatively easy once he has initiated an all-in-one. Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy does not have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "Against tristana, Her E and Q makes taking down turrets a piece of cake. Avoid letting her get free shots on your turret since the tower platings will give her a gold advantage over you.\n\nAvoid extended trades with Tristana whenever her E is on you. The more auto-attacks she hits you with- the more damage you will take. \n\nTristana will often use her W aggressively. If you\u2019re strong and have good all-in, you could try to trade back with her and use her mispositioning to kill her.

Hecarim can easily take these goals."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Seraphine's early game is pretty decent. Her damage and CC are pretty substantial, especially if she can use the lane brushes.\n\nLevel 6 is a decent powerspike as Seraphine will get her Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is stacked together or is standing in a line.\n\nThe first item component increases her damage and allows her to use her abilities a bit more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will need to be careful about spamming spells.        "}

Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. Post 6, avoid fighting them at any cost because they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will kill you easily. It will be ruined much sooner. Make sure to apply as much pressure as you can to match its first ganks."}
{"text": "As nasus, At level 9, Nasus maximizes its first ability. Its damage production and trading potential at this stage of the game will be quite high. At level 11, Nasus will put the second point in its Ultimate R. It will be really tanky and high level of position 16. In the middle of the game, Nasus would have picked up several hundred piles on his Q. Continue farming and you will soon become a huge threat."}

As you\u2019re not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game.

Be ready to turn around the map and help them fight."}

Use effigies and bamboozle enemies with surprise Ultimate R's on them."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, In team fights, make sure no one on your team is too far ahead that Malzahar can try to catch someone out of position with his Ultimate R. When you sit goals or step back from a fight, look at your positioning that you can walk in Malzahars Q that can be devastating to your health bar. As soon as Malzhar concentrates a champion with his Ultimate R, try the CC so the chain is cancelled."}

Your Ultimate e is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Avoid fighting around the goals as Poppy can use his Ultimate R to shoot down the Jungler and cost your team the Baron/ Dragon. In team fighting, disengage and avoid team fighting in the jungle as this will allow Poppy to get a good boost with his Ultimate R or choose a key target with his E. Fighting around Poppys Ultimate R is a good way to win team fighting."}
{"text": "As rumble, Can do a lot of damage to enemy units with his Passive empowered r who are close to him. This makes it easy for him to act as a disruptor during team fights.\n\nHis e combined with his d can allow him to run down a single enemy target easily. The d shield allows him to mitigate a good amount of poke as well.\n\nHis Ultimate b makes him a menace during team fights. The enemy team can\u2019t afford to fight in closed spaces or they will definitely get chunked out by his Ultimate b."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Watch your position in the late game team fights. Stay as safe as possible so you won't be killed first. Cassiopeia is one of the strongest late game champions, so staying alive is the key. Stay with your team in the late game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to choose you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, It is especially true if someone manages to interrupt their Ultimate R, because it is the ability that can turn the tide of a team fight alone. The seriously painful wounds are quite effective against him. He is equally squishy as well as he was not able to do much if the enemy team gets a reduction of healing during the early match. His greatest weakness is an enemy team that can keep well. This is legitimately going against the Fiddles entirely and preventing him from all-inning the enemy team in a coherent way. The vision will allow the enemy to anticipate his movement and react accordingly."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, His y is a great tool that can allow him to escape ganks and skirmishes with the enemy during the laning phase.\n\nWukong\u2019s Ultimate n is a very good tool. It can be used to help his team win team fights, and for him to get kills during the laning phase. \n\nWukong excels at extended trades with his s and k. He is a very strong duelist in the laning phase.\n"}
{"text": "As rammus, Concentrate them with your other front-line champions. As you are the Jungler, you must make sure that you are still alive in the late match. If you will die before a major goal scares, the enemy will be able to take it. Make sure that you are still on the side of the map that the next major goal is safe. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free."}
{"text": "As renekton, You will have to be careful about its dash. It can give you a false sense of security that can lure you to go for the easy farm, while Renekton goes and everything in you. Bait his Ultimate out when possible. This will allow you to easily win all the fights he takes after his ult runs out. Wait for Renekton to use his dash until you use your ult on him. This will also help your Jungler during the ganks. Keep the wave near the tower and focus on getting tankier in this matchup. Do not do it easily can allow the enemy of everything in you."}
{"text": "Against amumu, The Amumu team's presence is very strong. Do not regroup too closely as it will allow it to get a multi-person entanglement with its Ultimate y. Do not fight in the jungle either for the same reason. Try to start a team fight as soon as it has ended. Fighting when Amumu is not there or when his Ultimate is on cooldown is a sure way to win the next fight."}
{"text": "As nidalee, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies ahead. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure you try to exploit your early advantage.\n\nLook to secure objectives as often as possible. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes along.\n\nFind a healthy balance between ganking your allies, farming your jungle and securing objectives. Make sure you do not fall behind in XP by trying to constantly gank."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, Aurelion is a mana hungry champion. Keep a constant eye on your mana bar at all times otherwise you'll have little kill threat. He will also be vulnerable to ganks and all-ins if he is low. Ensure you have enough mana to use your W just in case something happens.\n\nAurelion Sol is a very difficult champion to play. You will need to put in a lot of time to master Aurelion Sol.\n\nAs Aurelion Sol is a roam heavy champion, it can be difficult for you to roam if your side lanes are not strong. It will also be hard to roam against champions with good pushing power."}
{"text": "As jayce, Once you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nWhen you hit level 6, you need to play a bit safer as you do not have an Ultimate G, unlike every other Top laner. Play respectfully and stay at max range while harassing the enemy from afar.\n\nUse your s to poke the enemy as often as possible. Use your basic attacks in conjunction with this ability to get the enemy low."}
{"text": "As hwei, At level 9, you maximize your first ability. This ability will significantly increase at this stage, which will help you win fights. You are good in team fights because of your AOE abilities. The teams will be grouped in the middle of the game so that you will be strong at this stage of play. At level 11, you will have put an additional point in your R. Use this advantage to get choices in the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton is one of the first strongest game champions in the game. You can use this advantage to win an advance. To tons of support in the way thanks to his e.

{"text": "As karma, Her 2nd ability will be maxed out at level 13. Depending on the maxed ability, she will either be able to CC enemies frequently while regenerating HP or easily shield her team from enemy poke and all-ins.\n\nKarma will have multiple items completed during this stage of the game. This will allow her to dish out a lot of damage while peeling for her carries at the same time.\n\nHer poke damage will be pretty significant during the late game, and that ability will be up quite frequently. This means her DPS will be through the roof, which is highly beneficial for her team."}
{"text": "Against ekko, When you invade Ekko, try to wait in a bush for him to use his W (and wait for it to expire) before joining him. When his shield is lowered, it is much weaker and easier to kill. Try to place the vision inside the river and around its jungle entrances. This will make it more difficult to gank successfully if you still know its approximate location."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Level 6 is an important peak for Mordekaiser as it can convert a fight to 1 v 1. It becomes simple for Mordekaiser to kill his target. The first element will allow Mordekaiser to survive and inflict a lot of damage. Compensations will be fast, and his ganks will be strong enough now. His early game ganks are really good due to his abilities. It should be pretty comfortable ganking tracks with heavy CC as they will allow him to get massive tracks."}
{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze is at his weakest at the beginning of the game. Try to abuse him by looking for an early all-in to force him to remember. Ryze does not point to level 6 as his Ultimate R is a utility tool. Use this to your advantage to win an all-in level 6. You should try to finish the game as quickly as you can that Ryze becomes stronger and stronger than the game goes."}
{"text": "As garen, At level nine, Garen will have his first ability maxed out. This is a decent power spike as it allows him to duel enemies easily and go for regular short burst trades.\n\nOnce he manages to get 2 points in his Ultimate R, he will have an effortless time catching enemies off-guard and killing them. He should use the lane brushes to go for regular short burst trades.\n\nHis survivability is outstanding during the mid-game, and he can run enemies down while peeling for his carries. If he takes a lot of damage, he can quickly back off and let his Passive kick in."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, When Tryndamere has finished his Mythic article, he will be really strong in the 1v1 skirmishes with the enemy. He will also be really mobile and difficult to kill thanks to his Ultimate e and E. At level 6, Tryndamere will be unstoppable and will not die in the 1v1 fights. It will be really difficult to kill when his Ultimate e is in place. Tryndamere has good objective control and can easily solo the Dragon and Rift Herald in the early game. Try to take them if you can do them undisputed."}
{"text": "As corki, Delay a team fight for as long as possible while you poke and harass the enemy with your b and e. Once the enemy is low, you can commit to the fight.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nAvoid overextending or dying alone. When you\u2019re dead, the enemy may be able to siege an objective, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu will naturally want to farm to level 6 for his y. Delay his level 6 power spike by invading him and pushing him out of his jungle as early and as frequently as possible.\n\nRek\u2019Sai will beat Amumu in any stage of the game in a 1v1, which is more prevalent in the early game. Do not be afraid in forcing a fight with Amumu in the early game to take early control of the jungle where he is most vulnerable.\n\nRek\u2019Sai has much faster clears than Amumu which allows extra time for vision and jungle control. This is especially important as Amumu has linear gank patterns with only his s so getting vision through the river will reduce his gank success drastically.\n\nRek\u2019Sai is a lot more gank-heavy than Amumu in the early game which allows her to set up huge advantages through repeated ganks that Amumu cannot reliably act on. This helps to take control of the jungle so Amumu has a lesser impact post-6."}
{"text": "As lulu, During the laning phase, focus on poking the enemy down to gain a health advantage. When the enemy is low, commit to an all-in.\n\nTry your hardest to keep your ADC alive for as long as possible in lane. Provide them with shields whenever they need them.\n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Look at the ambushes around the map. It's really good to start skirmishes and pick up weak and still champions. Keep this in mind and avoid walking on the map alone. In the team fights, once they enter with their E, they have nothing to offer and will be in an overstretched position. Use their forward positioning to play aggressive and shoot them. Constantly try to punch and harass him. Having him in poor health will prevent him from playing or positioning aggressively."}
{"text": "As tristana, The slow on her W can allow her to get killed quite easily. She will have to whip her target before that, or she can rely on a gank or her support. Her damaged E tower allows her to buy plates and destroy the towers with ease. This will put her forward in the way, as well as quick lenses if she is left unchecked. Her self-plubbing ability is strong enough and she can get out of sticky situations with her W and Ultimate R. This is probably one of the safest door in the game."}
{"text": "As kennen, If the team fight is important for Kennen, falling behind the gold and XP will make you almost useless in the team fights. Watch to flank in the team fights. Fighting as Kennen can be difficult if the enemy is able to disengage or has poke damage. To make the team fight easier, watch to flank on the side. Whenever your Ultimate m is up or when your team is ready, you should group with them."}
{"text": "Against corki, When Corki reaches level 6, its pressure to kill and push power increases thanks to its Ultimate e. Make sure you are still behind at least 1 minion so that it can't push you and you poke at the same time. Corki can be really good in the middle of the game and in these team fights. Make sure you stop it early so that it isn't very strong during the middle or the end of the game. Once Corki finishes his first article, he will do a lot of damage and seek to be more aggressive. Keep this in mind during trading."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Gwen will be divided by pushing in the middle of the game. You can use the number advantage to take her down or start a team fight on her team while she is elsewhere on the map. She will be hard to kill in team fights, so you will need to play around her W to make it easier for you to close it. The healing reduction will be very useful in team fights that Gwen will get a lot of support."}
{"text": "As taric, If the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus on the squishiest and easiest to kill high-priority targets in the backline. Your Ultimate R will help you a lot with that.\n\nIn the late game, look for picks on immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nProtect your allies with your life in this matchup. Make sure that you use your Ultimate R at the proper time or it may very well cost you the game."}
{"text": "As naafiri, In the late game, flank the enemy and stick near your teammates.

This when combined with lane brushes, or the river brushes can allow him to deal a lot of damage without taking any in return.\n\nPantheon has great pick potential with his R and W.

{"text": "As morgana, Really good waveclear with her W. This can allow her to shove the wave really quickly and then help her Jungler on different occasions.\n\nHer Q helps her with gank set-ups, and picks during the mid-game. The root duration can easily allow her to hide in a Jungle brush and wait for her target to wander into her Q range.\n\nThe E can allow her to make one of her carries or herself invincible to CC for a while. This is really beneficial during team fights, or when laning against heavy CC."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, At level 9, Jarvan will get his first maximum ability. This will give him a massive increase in damage, impacting the fights at a much higher level. Once Jarvan reaches level 11, he will put two points in his Ultimate m. This will increase the damage of this ability while simultaneously reducing his cooldown. This will allow Jarvan to look for peaks more often. Jarvan IV is good in the team fights due to his d Passive and his ability to CC several enemies to go with his d > e combo. Its Ultimate m will also allow him to distinguish the enemies that need to be dealt with quickly."}
{"text": "As chogath, Play safely in the early game. Cho=Gath needs time to scale and come online. Avoid fighting if possible. Keep the wave closer to your side of the card early.

If the enemy tries to play aggressive, m them and fall back to security."}

At that point, Warwick will become really powerful. He will be able to sustain himself easily while doing primary objectives or taking part in significant fights.\n\nWarwick is extremely good at making picks, thanks to his Ultimate R. This helps him make picks from the fog of war which will definitely catch enemies off guard.        "}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 16, Ezreal will put the third point in his Ultimate R. He will deal a lot of burst damage to anyone who is hit with it in the late game.\n\nWhen Ezreal is coming to completing his build, he will have incredibly low cooldowns on all of his abilities. This is good for him as he will be able to continue to poke and harass the enemy before a team fight occurs. Also, his E will be on a short cooldown which allows him to escape skirmishes easily.\n\nEzreal is great in the mid-game, but he does start to fall of in the late game as it will be harder for him to kill tanks."}
{"text": "Against fiora, Fiora is extremely good at level 1. If she gets the right Vital procs, she can cheese her first blood early or let you whisper your potions in your turn. Respect her all-in-potential and don't fight her early. When Fiora reaches level 6 her duel potential is fully realized. She can 1v1 almost anyone while her R is standing. Fiora is very good in the final stages of the laning phase and mid-game. Respect her potential 1v1 and try not to die to her."}
{"text": "As karthus, His early play is fragile, and he can easily be caught if he is not careful. He should focus on agriculture and scale with occasional exchanges.

{"text": "As trundle, Level 16 is a massive peak for Trundle. It can now make itself really powerful using the Ultimate n on the right person. It will be the decisive factor during team fighting. Most of its articles will be finished now, making Trundle extremely strong and allowing it to hit its enemies. It can easily use its pillar to block the enemy's escape routes. At level 14, it will have its 2nd ability maximized. This will only add to its power and allow it to disrupt enemy fighting and get closer to them very quickly so it can kill them."}
{"text": "Against kled, Kled will always be stronger when he is mounted. He is slightly weaker when he is disassembled. At level 6, Kled has increased mobility and the potential to impact several tracks with his Ultimate R. He can also use his Ultimate R to engage and pursue the enemy. Do not overextend in the way as he can easily kill you. Kled is one of the strongest champions in the game. He will try to fight you as much as he can to get an early lead."}
{"text": "As ziggs, As Ziggs gets more items, it will cause a lot of chaos in terms of damage. This means that Ziggs can easily pull enemies to make the fighting team massively unfair for the enemy. Once Ziggs gets three points in his Ultimate R, it will inflict a huge amount of damage in a huge area during team fighting and goals. Fighting in the nested areas will give Ziggs a huge advantage too. Ziggs is good enough to take turns quickly. Yet, as he gets more items, he will completely decimate them with his passive self-attacks. After that, he can just cut the tower with his W, which means that the enemy can't do anything to defend their turn."}
{"text": "As karma, Go to the middle track after destroying or losing the lower track tower. Turn with your ADC or hold hands with your Mid laner to prevent the enemy from taking the medium track tower. In team fighting, use your power to provide a great shield to your allies. Unless you need to use your Qor d, you should try to use your d to help them survive. Stay with your allies in the middle of the game. Don't get too far away from them at any time as you will be an easy target for the enemy. Similarly, don't go to the guard unless your allies are nearby and able to help you."}

Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As taric, His Q can allow him to heal huge amounts of damage later in the game. This when he is combined with his passive, can allow him to heal as much during the first skirmishes. The Ultimate R can completely change the course of a fight due to making him everyone invulnerable. This is very effective on hyper-ports, or when against a champion who has an ultimate time (Master Yi for example). His W provides his port with bonus resistances that can be really beneficial in the long term because of usually not wearing any defensive items, especially in the lower elos."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Miss Fortune is a tyrant of the track and should be played as such. Try to bring down the enemy with your t and t during the laning phase.

She needs to get it as quickly as she can to make her ganks more successful."}
{"text": "As karma, Be cautious of Karma's poke. Detach from your ally when her Q ability is on cooldown to minimize the risk of taking damage.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your side of the lane to create opportunities for jungle assistance and to have a longer lane to chase down Karma and her ADC if needed.\n\nIf Karma roams, focus on punishing the enemy ADC by trying to secure a kill or applying pressure.

{"text": "As morgana, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}

His autos don't do much damage but only go to CC him when he isn't using any ability.\n\nKeep an eye out on your allies in this matchup. If you see someone is low and in a skirmish, ult them immediately.\n\nHe will definitely try to single you out in this matchup with his Ultimate. This is why you will need to pick him off first.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "Against kennen, Kennen is really good in team fights. Avoid fighting in the Dragon or Baron pit as it will allow him to get a good Ultimate m off. Kennen is inclined to peel and disengage.

Try to harass and poke Kennen as much as you can before a team fight occurs."}
{"text": "As kled, If you can attack on the side and get on a key target, the chances of winning a team fight will be increased. Look for choices or look to fight the person you are laning against when they try to prevent you from pushing split. If you are ahead, don't be afraid to fight but always check the card before committing to using your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against camille, Try and stand in the middle of the lane at all times. This will make it harder for her to land her E in a trade. Don\u2019t get close to the walls as this will give her the opening to engage. \n \nIf you\u2019re playing as a ranged champion, try and harass Camille with basic attacks whenever she tries to last hit. Camille lacks sustain in the early game, so you can poke her out of lane easily if you keep auto-attacking. \n\nIf Camille uses her E in lane, she will be vulnerable while it\u2019s on cooldown as it\u2019s her main way of disengaging from ganks. Bait out her E prior to your Jungler arriving in your lane to reduce her chances of survival."}
{"text": "As lucian, Strong power peak at level two that allows him to throw an enemy down with his E, Q combo. This combined with his Passive and Invocative Spells can easily get him killed on a squishy target. Very good clear wave with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This makes him gain the really fast priority and he also helps secure goals with his Jungler. After six, he can practically an enemy with his combo while repositioning simultaneously with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to avoid the ganks with ease."}
{"text": "As morgana, His Q helps him with the gank configurations, and takes in the middle of the game. The length of the root can easily allow him to hide in a Jungle brush and wait for his target to walk in his Q range. The E can allow him to make one of his invincible portages at CC for a while. It's really beneficial during team fighting, or during heavy CC laning."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax is likely to disengage, CC and poke. This can make team fighting difficult for him. If Jax does not have an early advance or can't help his allies, he will fall behind and will not be very strong in the later parts of the game. If the enemy starts building defensive objects, it is unlikely that he will kill one of the enemy teams door."}
{"text": "As nunu, His tankiness is out of bounds during this phase of the game. He can quickly run down enemies and peel for his carries at the same time due to his overall tankiness.\n\nA maxed-out Ultimate R will allow Nunu to dish out a lot of damage in a short time. If he can set up a death brush, he will automatically win the fight.\n\nHis late-game team fighting will be extreme as he is very tanky, and his ability to frontline will make it really easy for his team to succeed in fights."}
{"text": "As warwick, His E is a major part of his kit that allows him to dive into the enemy team. Otherwise, he cannot do much so by keeping a track on this use of abilities will allow his enemies to counter Warwick quite easily. Warwick. Q can carry him to the enemy champion, but this can be used against him as bait. Any champion with a flash or dash can easily move him under their turn and put him in a very disadvantageous position."}
{"text": "As neeko, A maxed-out Ultimate R will let Neeko use the ability quite frequently. All she needs to do is find a flank on the enemy team.\n\nHer late-game team fighting is really potent. She can disrupt an entire team with a well-placed R or Ultimate R.\n\nHer damage during the late game is absolutely massive. One E > Q combo is enough to half-health any squishy target."}
{"text": "As maokai, Your Ultimate R will be on a short cooldown during this phase of the game. Make sure you use it regularly to catch off enemies and get frequent kills on the enemy.\n\nThe fog of war is going to help you a lot during this phase of the game. Prepare some brushes with your E saplings and just all-in the enemy as soon as they come close to it.\n\nYou will be very powerful during this game phase, and your tankiness will be really high.

{"text": "As riven, Keep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them after they\u2019ve used an ability as they cannot use it to trade back with. Riven is less of a threat when they have an ability down.\n\nRiven is weaker than you at level 2. Use your level 2 advantage to go for an aggressive play with your basic combo.\n\nPost 6, your Ultimate offers you a ton of additional kill pressure and opportunities to get kills. Abuse this by playing around its cooldown and trying to make plays whenever it is up.\n\nAs Riven has a lot of built-in sustain, make sure you get some form of healing reduction quickly to make it easier for you to kill them."}
{"text": "As brand, Delay a team fight for as long as possible while you poke and harass the enemy with your W. Once the enemy is low, you can commit to the fight.\n\nPlace vision around the mid lane and wherever you and your ADC are currently playing. This will increase your chances of surviving an all-in.\n\nStick with your ADC throughout the mid-game. If you\u2019re alone, you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy. Similarly, if your ADC is alone, they might try to collapse on them and kill them."}
{"text": "Against orianna, Pay close attention to the location of Orianna\u2019s Ball d throughout the laning phase. Try and adapt your positioning and move to the opposite side of the lane to where her Ball d is.\n\nDo not roam unless Orianna has recalled. She has very good wave clear thanks to her d and d and can quickly push you in and take Tower plates.\n\nDue to her lack of mobility and her inherent ability to push waves, Orianna tends to be weak against ganks. Ask your Jungler for ganks whenever she pushes the lane."}
{"text": "As maokai, Maokai's Level 2 is a decent powerpike since it can now look towards the whole ADC enemy or Support with a powerful CC combo. The chances of success increase with the amount of Maokai poke can land on enemies with its waffles. Level 6 is a massive power peak for Maokai as it allows it to get an AoE CC capability that is really beneficial in the lit objective combats. It is the most dangerous and effective when it is used from war fog. Boots are a pretty strong early game purchase as it allows it to go often and respond to Jungle's skirmishes. It is powerful around the track brushes due to the amount of damage that its waffles do."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Several elements during this phase of the game will allow him to effectively fight enemies. His damage will be quite significant now. Another point in his Ultimate R will make him have a lot of potential to pick. He can easily hide around the map and 1 v 1 squishy targets. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. He will grant him increased damage and survival, and now he will be a massive threat to the enemy team."}
{"text": "As lux, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning.

Do not get picked off by trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As poppy, Can easily be kited by ranged carries even without using their dashes. Her Q can easily be sidestepped as it has a very short range.\n\nCan be killed easily if she overextends with her E. She also acts as a frontline so the enemy can flank her teammates before going for her.\n\nMisuse of her Ultimate R can land both her and her team in huge trouble. This is especially true if the enemy team has some sort of heavy engage which can get on her team\u2019s carry."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Hard engagement is the best way to deal with Ezreal during the laning phase. But you will need to wait for him to use his E if your CC is a skill shot. Ezreals poke damage starts to stack if you take too many Qs in the face. Make sure you are still standing behind the minion wave at all times. In team fights, you must not let Ezreal fall before you have the chance to engage. If it is isolated, run on it as fast as you can to start the fight. Do not delay team fights against an Ezreal."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille has a good potential out of the game with her E and Ultimate R. She can often surpass the enemy and turn around or escape the exchanges with ease. She is a difficult champion that is quite fun and rewarding. Players who put a lot of effort to learn her will reap the rewards of a veteran player Camille. Her Ultimate R is a good tool that can lead a murder every time. If she is unable to kill the enemy lantern, she can go another way and use it instead."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, As Nautilus e can hit the players who come into contact with her, if you are close to the concentrated ally, you could be hit as well. Nautilus will often be the first player on his team. Once he has entered the stage, try to concentrate him if his teammates do not follow him. Nautilus fights again to get out once out, so if he makes a mistake, he will abuse Nautilus will automatically attack anyone approaching him by trying CCs with his passive. Try and stay away and out of reach during team fights if you are squishy."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies forward. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure to try to exploit your early advantage. Look to secure the goals whenever they're. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes. Find a healthy balance between your allies, farming your jungle and security goals. Make sure you don't fall back in XP trying to gank constantly."}
{"text": "Against ahri, As long as you build magic resistance and dodge her Charm, she has no way of one-shotting you.\n \nAhri likes to roam after level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate. Ping her as soon as she leaves lane and try to follow if possible. If you can\u2019t follow her, push the wave and try to draw her back to lane.\n \nAhri is incredibly vulnerable when her Ultimate is down. Try to bait it out first, and then call for assistance from your Jungler to kill her while it\u2019s unavailable. Make sure the wave is closer to your side of the map to make it easier for them to gank you."}
{"text": "Against ahri, Even though she will be playing the Support role, Ahri has great burst and pick potential on targets that are moving around the map alone. Make sure you group and avoid walking in areas that are unwarded when you know Ahri\u2019s been nearby. \n \nAhri is incredibly vulnerable when her Ultimate is down. Forcing fights when it is down will make it difficult for her to fight, trade and escape a team fight.\n \nBe on the lookout for Ahri\u2019s active items as she will use them to isolate and take down slow and immobile champions."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Her overall power increases with the number of drakes she has captured during the early and the mid-game. Hence, she must prioritize them.\n\nLevel sixteen is a decent power spike as well. It will bolster her Ultimate t's damage in the game, and she can blow up enemies with ease now.\n\nHer overall strength will depend on the build she goes for. She can either blow up enemies from far away with her AP build, or she can dive into the enemy team and act as a bruiser."}
{"text": "As rakan, Level 16 is another decent spike where he can use his Ultimate R much frequently. The enemy team will always have to watch their flanks.\n\nRakan is great during late-game fights as his W, E, and Ultimate R will be on very short cooldowns. He will have to use the fog of war when possible.\n\nRakan is quite potent during the late game. This is because he can pick off enemies constantly due to his abilities being on short cooldowns and being able to escape quickly."}
{"text": "As morgana, Her Q can be blocked by minions. If the enemy is positioning well throughout the laning phase, it will be very hard for you to land this ability.\n\nMisuse of her E can lead her to many nasty situations which are potentially lethal for her. This is especially true if her opponent has some form of hard CC.\n\nMissing her Q can give her enemies a long time window to harass her freely. That ability is quite easy to dodge if she tries to land it from vision or from maximum range."}
{"text": "As karthus, They have global map pressure with their Ultimate. So ping when Karthus hits level 6.\n\nWatch your positioning at all times and stand away from the minion wave (especially after Karthus has his first component item).\n\nKarthus is immobile and easy to gank. Keep the wave closer to your side of the map to force him to over extend and miss position for the farm.\n\nTry and go for extended auto-attack fights with him as you will win those. But do try and reposition so he cannot easily land his Qs on you.\n"}
{"text": "As khazix, If they invade you, just back off, as they can easily kill you, especially if you\u2019re behind.\n\nThey can secure objective so much easier than you can. Keep them warded to spot them before they can secure the objective.\n\nPost 6, avoid fighting them at all costs as they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will easily kill you.\n\nHe will be ganking a lot early on. Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As urgot, Peel for your carries in late game team fights to increase the chances of your team winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}
{"text": "As camille, If Camille tries to crush you with his W, you can try to enter with your E and stab her with your authorized self attack if it looks like an optimal trade. The outer range of the W inflicts additional damage, and has a healing and slowness, while the inner range of the W does not slow down or heal Camille. If Camille manages to land an E on you and you all want in it, throw your Ultimate right before it stuns you so that you don't waste time throwing your Ultimate out of the dizziness. You can win the AD bonus and healing earlier in the fight that can make all the difference. The duration of Camille's passive shield does not exceed your Recast window Q. You should hold your Q and wait for her passive shield to fall before you re-engage. You won't heal her shield as well, so don't waste your passive auto on her. When Camille uses her E to engage you, don't try to spoil it and make your movements very linear, and at the last moment use your E in the opposite direction."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Avoid fighting with Xin Zhao early on as you will surely lose. If you must take a fight, make sure you have backup.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate e, you should be able to lock and kidnap enemies with ease. Just make sure that Xin doesn't get too close to you.\n\nIf you see Xin ganking a lot, feel free to invade him and steal his camps. It should be easy to do and will set back Xin massively.\n\nTry to match his pressure by ganking as often as he is."}
{"text": "As gragas, His Ultimate R can easily be dodged by enemies who have dashes or any movement tools.\n\nIf the enemy has good positioning in lane, it will be very difficult for you to engage or use your E in the lane. This is because your E can be blocked by minions if the target is not directly behind them.\n\nGragas\u2019s Ultimate R is very easy to mess up. You may want to use it aggressively to knock someone forward but instead, knock them backwards."}
{"text": "As varus, If he uses his Q to push and poke at the same time, he makes good use of his mana. Integrated-in Grevious Wounds with his E. This will reduce the healing of enemies in the way and in team fights as well. His ultimate R gives Varuus a ton of game and choice of potential for his team."}
{"text": "Against warwick, Warwick's largest power spike is when he hits level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R. If you\u2019re at risk of dying,  be ready to Flash as soon as he shows up in your lane.\n\nHe falls off in the late game but it doesn\u2019t mean he is useless. A good Ultimate R on a key target is enough to win the game. Investing in a QSS will offer you some protection.\n\nWarwick can solo objectives in the early game with ease. If there are no gank opportunities for him, he may be trying to take the Dragon instead. Keep it warded at all times so you can see him on it."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, At level 6, Seraphine will unlock her Ultimate R. This makes her more of a threat and she\u2019ll be able to set up her Jungler quite easily.\n\nSeraphine is good in team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Avoid grouping closely together so she is unable to get a strong Ultimate R off.\n\nOnce Seraphine has completed her first item, her Q damage will increase and so will her kill threat. Make sure you avoid getting hit by her Q\u2019s."}
{"text": "As graves, Graves inflicts a lot of damage to any target during this phase due to its passive and articles. It is a significant peak of power for him, which can very well allow him to carry a game alone. Once he gets three points in his Ultimate t, no ill-health enemy on the map will be safe. He can just put on, auto an enemy twice, and then use his Ultimate t to finish them. At level 13, Graves will be able to do a lot of brilliant damage and play around the enemy due to his maximum out there l and e. Moreover, he will give him an excellent duel advantage."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan has tons of mobility thanks to his E. It can allow him to move around the lane with ease, and get on to the enemy laner quickly.\n\nAkshan can bring back his dead allies if he can kill the enemy who killed them. This is great, especially in the later stages of the game where death timers are quite long.\n\nHis W allows him to get out of sticky situations and allow him to be camouflaged for a long period of time if he stays near a wall.\n"}
{"text": "As rakan, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As ashe, Because of your range advantage, you should always try to push the wave when the enemy Jungler is not near your track. This will allow you to drop the enemy tower and maybe take it quickly. Once this is done, change immediately to the midway as you will be safer there and will be able to get more targets in this way. Before the major objective battles, use your k to spot around the death of the brushes set up by the enemy. In addition, always keep your range and use your Q and slow self-attack to kite constantly the enemy team. You do not want to get caught by any form of CC because it will spell death for you then and there. If the enemy transport is very mobile, you may want to save your Ultimate w until you have a clean shot at them."}
{"text": "As kalista, Its level 6 is low in a solo track, especially against someone with a strong level 6 all-in like Renekton or Darius. If it falls back during the laning phase, it will be almost useless in the later parts of the game. If the enemy is tanky or has many slows or tools to reduce its mobility, it will fight to kite the enemy."}
{"text": "As rammus, Look to take down the enemy carries. Focus the backline and try to take them out of the fight. Focus them with your other frontline champions.\n\nAs you\u2019re the Jungler, you need to make sure you\u2019re always alive in the late game. If you die before a major objective spawns, the enemy will be able to take it.\n\nMake sure you are always on the side of the map that the next major objective is on. If the Baron is up, always stay on the top side. If you go bot and show yourself, the enemy will take the objective for free."}

Ward your flanks to make it harder for her to engage for free.\n\nIf Quinn can\u2019t team fight, she will stay in a side lane and try to split push. You can either send someone who has TP to prevent her from taking side towers, or you can quickly engage on to the enemy team and start a fight. Do not delay a team fight as it will give Quinn time to take an objective or rotate to join her team.\n\nQuinn\u2019s pick potential is high. When sieging an objective, make sure nobody in your team is too far forward as she can pick them off with her E and start the fight."}
{"text": "As lux, Once it has several objects, it will crush the enemies to the left, right and center. All it has to do is to sit in the fog of the war and wait for an unsuspecting enemy to enter on it. At level 16, Lux goes mega-spike. This is due to its Ultimate n being reclassified to level three. It will now blow up the enemies with the Ultimate n alone, and the cooling of capacity will be negligible. Its g will be on a very low cooling now, and the Jungle will be its playground."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, If the enemy team focuses on destroying his Q turrets before all-in\u2019ing him, he will have to play defensively till he can bring his turrets back up.\n\nMissing his E will put him in a vulnerable spot, especially if he is laning on his own or when he is pushed up. This mistake can easily get him killed.\n\nHe is very effective when he is fighting in closed spaces like the Jungle. The enemy can reduce this by fighting in the lanes and then matching his push if he tries to split push. Even in this case, if the enemy destroys his Q turrets, Heimerdinger will be done for."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of mana problems in the early game, but once she gets Tear of the Goddess she will play a lot more aggressive.\n\nCassiopeia really shines in the late game. She scales better than most champs and she can build 6 items. If you get ahead early- try closing out the game as soon as possible.\n\nNot many champions are as strong as Cassiopeia is at level 2. Beware of the level 2 all-in with her Q and E spam."}
{"text": "Against veigar, The longer the game goes, the stronger Veigar will be thanks to the unlimited stacking with his e. End the game as quickly as you can.\n\nVeigar is rather weak and vulnerable in the early game. You could try to abuse this to set him behind and miss out on stacks.\n\nOnce Veigar has his Ultimate R, his kill pressure increases. Keep in mind that he will deal a lot of extra damage at this time. "}
{"text": "Against caitlyn, If she doesn't use her E and plays safely, you can try a flash to engage her or lure her from inside a bush. An enemy Caitlyn can deposit a lot of damage in a team fight if she is left unchecked. Try to concentrate her as soon as possible so she is unable to deposit a lot of damage. If she is protected, try to surround her. Punishing Caitlyn in the early match will reduce her ability to snowball and destroy your turn. Try and place her behind by killing her again and again with the help of your allies."}

If you have motion capabilities that can be used to avoid, do not use them unless his **Ultimate** is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As hwei, After your lower lane has turned towards the middle lane, go on the side lane, apply pressure, and start plowing in the side lane instead. Make sure to place deep quarters and vision to protect yourself from the ganks. You will be strong enough in the middle of the game that you are good in team fighting. So, you should look at team fighting with your teammates during this game stage. In the middle of the game, other champions will be stronger than you (even if you will be good too)."}
{"text": "As shaco, By maximizing his Ultimate I, Shaco's ability to kill solo enemies will increase considerably. The AoE aspect of his Ultimate will prevent him from regrouping as well. He will crush a lot of poke damage during this phase of the game. He can shoot squishy targets as well as by invading the enemy rear line of the war fog. He will fall during the end of the game, so he will want to use his early play advance to win the game quickly. He should use neutral and objective fights in his snowball advance as these are the places where he can use his Ultimate I most effectively."}
{"text": "As pantheon, In team fights, and when ganking, Pantheon is easily kitable. It may be really hard for him to get on to an enemy if they have a lot of dodging or dashing tools too, even with his point and click CC on his W.\n\nIf Pantheon doesn\u2019t get ahead, he will be really hard to play in the later parts of the game. He will be pretty much useless outside of his W and E.\n\nUnlike many Junglers, Pantheon cannot use his Ultimate R in a 1v1 setting. He can not use his Ultimate R in skirmishes or in team fights either (albeit he can start a skirmish with his R)."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is really easy to kit. As he is still, champions with dashes, range advantage or poke make it difficult for Darius to get on and kill them. He falls at the end of the game. Darius is a starting champion in the middle of the game and once he arrives at the later stages of the game, his strengths become weaknesses. His Ultimate e is crucial in team fights to remove key targets. If he misses his Ultimate e, his release of damage will be greatly reduced and he could cost him the team fight. That's why he has to throw his Ultimate e as soon as the enemy enters the range of health."}
{"text": "As rumble, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early.

She is an excellent team fighter, especially if she manages to get to the top of the enemies of the war fog. Flanking will help her a lot during the team fights. The second point of her Ultimate t will increase the damage she can inflict on her enemies. Again, she will have to rely on the flanks to ensure that she can make the most of this ability."}
{"text": "As fiora, Fiora is weak in the game very early. She needs time and elements before coming online. However, she has a lot of total pressure. Her first major power peak is when she gets her first element. It offers her extra pressure to kill in the way and will allow her to get a lead. At level 6, Fiora will unlock her ultimate R. Her pressure to kill will intensify again and she will be able to look for more risky all-in thanks to the healing he provides."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Your Ultimate e makes you unqualified for a period of time. This makes it difficult to kill you who can give you time to kill the enemy.

This can be of great value for setting up ganks for his Jungler."}
{"text": "Against riven, Riven is a dominant early-playing champion who can take the way through short trades. Try not to trade with her unless you can match her trading potential. Riven will often play hyper-aggressive and try to overplay with her e. If possible, try to lure her main abilities and then reconnect with her when she has cooldowns. This is your best bet during laning against a Riven. Keep the minion wave frozen near your turn. If you play near your turn, her all-in-pot potential is limited as the tower will protect you and she won't be able to look for frequent trades."}

Keep the wave near your turn. The enemy does not have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As karma, Karma has a lot of poke damage on her Q, and she can easily CC someone with her d. Using the track brushes to land free poke on her enemy laner will allow her to assert domination in this way. Since Karma has her Ultimate from the beginning, it will not be too difficult to sting at 6. To compensate, Karma will have to play the early laning phase aggressively to completely dismantle the enemy track. The first element will increase her poke damage and mana (using a regeneration or a pure mana pool)."}

He can use it to instill lap dives and trick shots, while if he finds himself taking a lot of damage and getting disassembled, he can easily get Skaarl back. His Ultimate R allows him to initiate a team struggle with ease. It can be used as a ability to score peaks on still champions too."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, Depending on what level you take your W your first power spike is when you hit level 3 or 4.

He is quite squishy as well so he won\u2019t be able to do much if the enemy team gets healing reduction during the early game.\n\nHis biggest weakness is an enemy team that can ward well.

{"text": "As ekko, His W allows him to engage in an enemy group or champions, or a single enemy champion with ease. It's really beneficial if he can land him out of the sight and then use his E to get high in the W circle to ensure stunning. His brilliant damage must not be ignored as the game continues. This is especially true when he is ahead of the game. He can literally pull the enemy out of the rear line in a spin of spells, if he reaches W E on them. His Ultimate R is the most powerful ability in his kit because it allows him to undo his mistakes, especially when he chooses a bad fight or fails an all-in-one."}

That being said, make sure you have a defensive item or some escape plan if things go south.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one.

{"text": "As chogath, The enemy will not waste much in the early game, so try your hardest to get as many ganks as possible. Getting your allies forward will only cause the enemy to fall behind and make their Jungler useless. Priorize taking the Dragons early. You can solo the Dragon with ease, or you can ask for help and turn towards it after helping the robot. Make sure you secure all the Dragons when possible to deny them from the enemy. Although the enemy Jungler will not be spoiled, fighting alone will be difficult because they have tools to escape or prevent the fight. If you spot them alone, try to force them out of their jungle without engaging in the struggle without assistance. A good time to invade them and look for them is when your nearby ways have priority. At level 6 is when the enemy will probably start to waste. You can follow them with a good vision through the neighborhoods placed in and around the river. If you are nearby, try to counter gank as they have nothing to offer once they have used their abilities."}
{"text": "As irelia, Three points in her Ultimate R will give her a peak of massive power. Then, with a short cooling, she will take more fighting and easily choose enemies in the side tracks. At this point, due to her articles, Irelia will be extremely tanky and will do tons of damage. The amount of damage she inflicts will catch most of the out-of-guard enemies, especially if she manages to flank the enemy. Irelia is particularly good in the fighting, specifically the fighting that occurs around the choking points."}

{"text": "As rell, To minimize the risk of attack, aim to reach Level 2 at the same time as Rell. This ensures you have access to all your abilities and reduces its aggressive engagement potential. Contact your team when Rell lacks the track, as it is a strong roaming champion. Alerting your teammates allows them to play more cautiously and be prepared for games or potential games of Rell in other ways. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to reduce the chances of being all-in-one by Rell and his ADC.

Make sure you take the bottom side Scuttle Crab and keep the Drake warded so you can spot him in case he tries to take it. \n\nOlaf is going to be looking to gank often in the early game.

Ward around correctly before doing anything.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should have a lot more effectiveness in dueling enemies. An excellent way to bait the enemy will be to first let the wave push, and then as they are about to all-in you, you use your Ultimate R on them and bring them within your tower range.

Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to reduce his ability to everything within you and keep you down."}
{"text": "As gragas, Gragas' Ultimate R is very good in team fighting. It deals a lot of damage and can move the entire enemy team. It has good support in the way (compared to many other champions) with its W. This will allow it to look for jobs more frequently and heal after a job. Its E can be used in conjunction with Flash to get surprise jobs/commitments with the enemy. It can also use it to interrupt enemy abilities and dashes."}
{"text": "As viego, Having 2 points in his Ultimate R will make it easier for Viego to kill his targets. It will help him a lot during team fights and skirmishes near the objective pits.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give him a massive boost to his skirmishing potential. He will be powerful when fighting in choke points.\n\nViego is good in team fights as he can move quickly through his E, CC crucial targets with his W, and gain multi-kills with his Ultimate R.        "}
{"text": "As zeri, At level 16, Zeri will put the final point in her Ultimate R. Her Ultimate R will now deal maximum damage in fights.\n\nTeam fights are really where she shines. Depending on her build, she will be really strong and can deal a ton of damage in a fight.\n\nIn the late game, she should be near full build. As long as she positions well and kites, she will be very good in team fights."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lissandra is really good in team fights as you can flank the enemy from the side with your E.\n\nShe has incredible gank set up throughout the laning phase thanks to her W and her R. This makes her a formidable opponent against squishy champions.\n\nYour wave clear is incredibly strong and you can clear waves fast. You can then use your lane priority to roam with ease."}
{"text": "As ekko, You are a good ganker early. Make sure you equal his ganking pressure early on.\n\nFocus on securing those objectives. It is important that you try to take those objectives whenever possible to give your team a lead.\n\nOnce Ekko goes in, he doesn\u2019t have much left. So you can abuse this as you\u2019re a good counter ganker.\n\nPlaying around your Ultimate is crucial in this matchup. Try to make plays whenever you have your Ultimate available to you."}
{"text": "Against vi, Keep the Dragon warded at all times. Vi has good objective control and take them pretty easily. One way of countering this is by keeping the objectives warded or taking them before she gets the chance to.\n\nAs Vi is an early game Jungler, try to place vision around her jungle entrances and in the river to reduce the chance of her getting successful ganks off. Vi can gank from level 3 onwards once she has her Q.\n\nTry your hardest to equal Vi\u2019s pressure by ganking often or counter ganking her. If you\u2019re not as good as her in the early game, try to secure objectives if she shows on the opposite side of the map or invade her jungle and steal away camps."}
{"text": "As pyke, By playing Yuumi against Pyke, enjoy the advantage of your range by typing it and harassing it when its Q (Bone Skewer) is on cooldown. This allows you to abuse your top range and make a favorable trade with it. It is important to reach level 2 at the same time as Pyke to maintain parity in the laning phase. Having access to all your abilities and the level advantage increases your chances of responding effectively to any aggression of the enemy duo. Communicate with your team when Pyke is going to lack track, as it is a champion known for its roaming potential. By pinging and alerting your teammates, you can help them play more carefully and be prepared for Pyke's potential games or games in other ways."}
{"text": "As renekton, Renekton relies heavily on his cooldowns to get a lead. Whenever his abilities are down, he is not really able to trade as much.\n\nSimilarly, Renekton needs to play around his Fury bar to get the most damage out during a trade. If he fights without Fury or uses the wrong empowered ability, it can cost him the trade. Avoid using your empowered e if possible.\n\nRenekton falls off in the later stages of the game as he no longer has his early game strengths when the game goes longer. Additionally, he is really bad in the later stages of the game if he didn\u2019t get an early lead."}
{"text": "As swain, Do not forget to take as many neutral and objective fights as possible. Your Ultimate R & E will help you massively with it. Since you will dive into the enemy team, you will want to get a defensive element like a Zhonya Hurglass. This will allow you to use your Ultimate R effectively. You will need to take care of your backline and see that they are not being subjugated and killed. If a murderer tries to kill them, E kills him immediately."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio should be getting his build completed by now. This will give him a massive spike in his ability to peel for the allied carries. His damage output will be pretty high as well.\n\nGalio's Ultimate R will still be handy during fights due to its knockup and low cooldown. He can quickly go into enemy territory to deward the area/set-up vision and then come back.\n\nLevel 16 isn't that big a spike for Galio. Although his Ultimate R cooldown is reduced and the cast range is increased, he won't have any incentive to use it for himself."}
{"text": "As teemo, It is vulnerable when its t is down, and can be engaged if its speed of movement k is reduced. Its ultimate t can easily be rid by the enemy by buying Control Wards. Enemy Junglers with jumps and dashes can also bypass these mushrooms by taking strange routes. It falls quite drastically during the end of the game and can only resort to split thrust. This puts his team in a disadvantageous state and causes a lot of tension to accumulate within the team."}
{"text": "As sona, 2 points in her Ultimate R will let her help her to choose targets. Apart from that, she can also use it defensively to escape adverse situations. Her presence in the middle of the game is strong because she does a lot of damage and can quickly heal her team. The increase in the speed of the movement is quite pleasant too. Her first ability will be maximized at level 9, which will allow her to do a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As rumble, It can do a lot of damage to enemy units with its self-sustaining R passive which are close to it. This allows it to act easily as a disruptor during team fighting. Its combined e with its d can allow it to easily descend a single enemy target. The shield d allows it to mitigate a good amount of poke as well. Its Ultimate b makes it a threat during team fighting. The enemy team cannot afford to fight in closed spaces or they will certainly be shot down by its Ultimate b."}
{"text": "As braum, Make the most of your range to harass Braum. Avoid detaching from your ally when Braum reaches level 6 or when its ultimate capability is available, as this can lead to dangerous engagement. Pay attention to your positioning and use minions as a shield to block Braum's Q (Winter Bite) poke. Focus on remote harassment. If Braum decides to leave, ping your teammates to alert them and try to bring down the ADC enemy using your Q and base attacks."}
{"text": "As zed, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus on the squishiest and easiest to kill high-priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Focus on getting level three quickly, increasing your clear speed, and frequently gank in the game. Always try to gank overextended lanes when possible.\n\nYou will want to get your first item quickly as it will give you a massive damage boost and match quite well with your Ultimate R.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, your dueling power will increase. Always try to pick off the enemy jungler with this and then take the Dragon or Rift Herald.        "}
{"text": "As camille, In the late game, Camille is good at picking off champions with her Ultimate R. It should be on a low cooldown and if you\u2019re able to Ult R the right champion (like a carry), you could win the game.\n\nWhile you have good pick potential, the enemy will start building defensive stats which will make it harder for you to kill the carries on your own. Keep this in mind when diving in with your E.\n\nAlthough you will find it harder to kill carries on your own, you will be quite tanky and deal a lot of damage thanks to the items you buy. Don\u2019t be afraid to jump in and soak up damage if you need to."}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, It\u2019s not impossible for Jarvan IV to gank at level 2 once he has unlocked his d and e. \n \nOnce Jarvan hits level 6, his kill pressure increases a ton as his Ultimate m is really good for ganking.\n \nJarvan is good in the early game and good in the mid-game too. The more gold he gets, the more he can do and the tankier he will become. Keep in mind that he will continuously look to gank in the early and look for fights in the mid-game. "}

{"text": "As tristana, Just like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game. Do not go around the map alone as you will die easily.\n\nDo not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and auto-attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will focus you and take you down.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target."}
{"text": "As twitch, If you\u2019re nearby when Twitch ganks, don\u2019t be afraid to counter gank as you\u2019re really strong in the 2v2, especially post 6.\n\nIf you have a lead, go ahead and invade him. Try to fight him for his camps as you can win the 1v1 as long as you can get on top of him.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate to get more kills! It is really important for you.\n\nPlace vision and buy control wards to help your team spot Twitch before he is able to gank and get kills."}
{"text": "As naafiri, As suggested, she is a heavy snowball champion, so if you don't get an early lead, it will be difficult to continue later. She suffers against teams that are smart and group together. It's more risky for you to enter alone, and you need your allies to enter with you. She can be well-equipped after she's entered. It can be difficult to manage champions with dashes or escape tools."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Aatrox is a lane bully who can snowball quite quickly. If you can get an early lead, try to abuse it to get more kills in the lane to increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nYou\u2019re a very mobile champion thanks to your E. It can be used in multiple ways and is a good way of turning around exchanges with the enemy.\n\nYou have tons of sustain thanks to your Passive and Ultimate. This will increase your survivability in team fights and skirmishes.\n"}
{"text": "Against vi, Keep in mind that Vi has a great potential of choice with its Ultimate R. Avoid walking too far forward in a team fight because she can choose someone who has crossed the line. According to Vis's construction path, she could seek to assassinate targets that are walking around the Rift Invocation alone. If she is in advance with a lot of damage, do not go through the river if she is not monitored. If Vi launches a fight with her Q, try to blow her up before she is able to activate her UltimateR. Even if she is tanky, she is prone to bursting damage and CC."}
{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze will try to avoid team fighting in the mid-game as he still needs time to come online. Looking for fights as soon as the laning phase has ended is favourable.\n\nTeam fighting in the late game is where Ryze can shine. Ending the game as quickly as possible will reduce his chances of coming online and winning the fight for his team.\n\nWarding your flanks will reduce Ryze\u2019s ability to get a good Ultimate R off and surprise your teammates. Avoid pushing too far forward when you don\u2019t know where Ryze is to reduce the chances of him catching you out with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As yasuo, His W is almost useless against you, as only your d can be blocked by it, but it can also save his demise by having it almost always off-cooldown.\n\nTry to avoid extended trades with Yasuo at all costs, as his abilities have low CD, and instead you should poke Yasuo with your d when he positions incorrectly.\n\nTry not to stay close to your minion wave, as Yasuo can use it as a way to close distance and make favorable trades for him.\n\nLet Yasuo push the wave at levels 1-5, as he can't really trade of dive you under tower unless he has jungle assistance, and use these windows to poke him down using your d and auto-attacks."}
{"text": "As nilah, Its first peak of power is at level 3 when it gets access to all its basic capabilities. When it finishes its first element, its trading and escarment power increases. Another peak of early play power is level 6, where it unlocks its ultimate R capability."}
{"text": "As anivia, In the last game, the damage to Anivia will be really horrible. She will have several items finished, and her Ultimate m will inflict tons of constant damage. The teams will continue to regroup in the last game. This helps Anivia as she can land a 5 person t, and her Ultimate m is an AOE tool. This means that she can inflict a lot of damage to the targets if they are grouped closely. In the last game, Anivia will have very few cooldowns on most of her abilities. She will be able to look for more frequent choices and secure kills with her team. Her t, in particular, will be on a very low cooldown in the last game."}
{"text": "As aatrox, When your team isn\u2019t looking to fight, split push and apply pressure elsewhere on the map.\n\nAvoid team fighting during the mid-game unless you have your Ultimate R up. When it\u2019s on cooldown, you\u2019ll miss out on a lot of sustain and damage, so you must play around with this abilities cooldown.\n\nIn mid-game team fights, look for picks by flanking the enemy backline. If you can get on to an enemy carry, you will increase your chances of winning a fight.\n"}
{"text": "As kindred, Before invading, make sure that you have your passive stacked so that you can win the trade. If they invade you, be ready to fight, but only do so if your passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just step back. Post 6, they win the 1v1 as they are stronger when their Ultimate is in place."}
{"text": "As neeko, As this is a poke game, you have to let Neeko push you in your lap otherwise you will have trouble surviving. Try to match Neeko's thrust power with automatic attack minions and avoid their poke. You're weaker than them every time they have their Ultimate Up. If you're in danger of dying, always remember at level 5 so you won't be killed when they hit level 6. Make sure you hit level 2 at the same time as Neeko, because they're much stronger than you at level 2 and hitting level 2 before or at the same time, you'll have a better chance of fighting back. Try to adjust your positioning as much as possible."}
{"text": "As fiora, Look for constant skirmishes with the enemy to gain health or kill lead. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in early play. This will allow you to hunt and all-in-the-enemy when they walk to the farm with your Q. Once you are level 6, use your strength to fight the enemy and go for a kill. Your Ultimate R is an excellent duel tool and can help you get a lead in the way."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio needs time to come online. Play safe in the game early so you can scale and come online. Do not get shot or you will fall behind in CS and XP and not be a threat later. Keep in mind that at level 6, you will not have a threat to kill in the way against most enemy travelers. Respect enemies all-in-damage level 6. Your ultimate R is impacted and can be used to help your allies in their own way. Keep an eye on what's going on around you and be ready to throw away your ultimate R to help your allies."}
{"text": "As syndra, Syndra is really powerful during the middle of the game because it can dry a lot of damage to the squishy enemies. It can easily set up death brushes as well. Several points in its Ultimate R will allow it to explode enemies with ease. Enemy squishies will have a difficult time to deal with Syndra. Its first ability will be maximized at level 9, and it will dry a lot of damage regularly. It can also inflict a lot of damage if it is sitting somewhere out of sight."}
{"text": "Against drmundo, Dr. Mundo can very easily grow under his turn. Try not to push the way against him because it is really beneficial to him. Instead, keep the wave even or closer to your side of the map so that you can receive ganks. If Dr. Mundo is behind, he will start cultivating with his Q. Don't start there unless he tries to secure a Minion Cannon. Dr. Mundo is rather motionless and can easily be killed when he's locked up."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Try and space accordingly to Veigar in team fights. Do not position too far forward as it will allow Veigar to catch you out with his n and start a team fight.\n\nLocking Veigar down with CC will be the best way to deal with him in team fights. He is pretty squishy so if you\u2019re able to get on to him and take him down at the start of the fight, your team will have an easier time winning it.\n\nVeigar will use his Ultimate R to try and take down a low health/defenceless enemy. Buy items that will make it less likely that he can one-shot you with his Ultimate R. Standing as far back as possible will also reduce his chances of using it on you."}
{"text": "As jhin, Level 6 a significant peak of power for Jhin as it can now put the final nail on the coffin of the targets that managed to escape with a healthy shine. It will also allow him to take the enemies with his Ultimate R slow. The first element will allow Jhin to do much more damage to the enemies and will strengthen his fourth firing efficiency. It will help his phase of overall lacquering by many. Jhin's Q is both his capability of clear wave damage and primary."}
{"text": "As neeko, Your champion is weak in the early game. Avoid fighting until you have a few levels behind you. Once you have an article and a few levels under your belt, you can look for skirmishes with the enemy. Focus on agriculture and pick up as much farm as possible in the early game. This will make you more than one threat in the later parts of the game."}
{"text": "As malzahar, He will have his core items by now, which means he will have a lot of mana and spam his Q and W.\n\nMultiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability frequently and make crucial picks.

{"text": "As lux, Lux will now have her core items and will hurt like a truck due to her AP ratios. Any squishy who gets caught by her g will most definitely end up dying.\n\nShe will spike really hard at level 11. This is mainly because of her Ultimate n upgrade, which will increase the damage of that ability while drastically reducing its cooldown.\n\nLux is generally good during team fights, but she will excel when fighting in choke points. The enemy won't be able to do anything to avoid Lux's g and will be zoned out by her l poke.        "}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Tryndamere will look to split push during the mid-game and he\u2019ll rarely join team fights. You can use the numbers advantage to force objectives or look for favourable fights to gain an advantage.\n\nIf Tryndamere is split pushing in the bottom side in the mid-game, avoid sending lots of people to stop him when Baron\u2019s up. It will take you some time to kill him even if you commit 5 champions to kill him which could give his team lots of time to take the Baron.\n\nTry to fight when Tryndamere doesn\u2019t have his Ultimate e} up. This will make it incredibly difficult for him to dish out lots of damage in a team fight."}
{"text": "Against azir, Avoid being too close to Azir-S Soldiers W as he can self-attack you from afar. When he places a Private W, move to a safer position out of his reach. Go for a trade after Azir-S Soldier W has disappeared. It is better to wait for Soldiers W to disappear first before fighting it because his damage performance will be diminished. After level 6 keep a sharp eye on the map and Azir-S mana bar. If you spot the enemy Jungler nearby, step back as Azir could try at Shurima Shuffle and set up his Jungler."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana relies on her Jungler to secure goals so she can get additional statistics. When her Ultimate t is broken, she is quite vulnerable and has no real disengagement, although her has can help her escape a little. She has so many meters in the upper lane. It can be really difficult to play Shyvana in many different matches."}
{"text": "As yorick, You can use your E to do it, but make sure you get rid of the necks first if you get hit by its E. Your Q should allow you to exchange a lot if you succeed in using the track brushes correctly. An excellent time for everything in it will be where its Q graves will not be present. Once you unlock your Ultimate, you should be able to 1 v 1 it quickly. Just bait its E out first so that you can take more minor damage during the trade. Get some Wounds Grievous to mitigate Yorick's healing. Also, if he finds himself using his Ultimate, disengage immediately."}
{"text": "Against jayce, It can do a surprising amount of damage in a full trade at level 4. Keep your distance so it can't jump on you. Jayce=s w s or sw combo is very good to push and bring you down. Stand behind the minion wave so they block the damage of its s. Don=t stand close to the wave as its s is AOE. It is very good in team fights. Make sure you engage as soon as possible so that it can not bring you down and get you out of the team fight."}
{"text": "Against senna, Senna has a good poke, harassed and good disengagement with her E. It is important that you commit as soon as you spot her to make her hard to escape. The more the game goes, the stronger Senna will be in the team fights. Try to put an end to the game as quickly as possible so that she is unable to be really effective in the middle of the game. As Senna is going to be on guard alone in the middle of the game, you could use this to your advantage to set up an ambush and shoot her. While she's dead, you could try to start a team fight with the advantage numbers or take the Baron/ Dragon."}
{"text": "Against warwick, Keep the wave closer to your side of the card early to reduce Warwick's chances of shooting you down and killing you. Investing in healing reduction can do a lot in this matchup. Warwick has a lot of support and will buy items that increase his healing. At level 6, Warwick will look for aggressive parts. If he can't use his Ultimate R in your way, he will turn elsewhere and use it instead."}
{"text": "As galio, Stay close to your team at any time in the late game. While your Ultimate R has a long range, the enemy can force a fight when you show elsewhere on the map. Play around your Ultimate R and wait for one of your allies to commit. Once they have entered, use your Ultimate R on them. Otherwise, wait for the enemy to commit and then throw your Ultimate R on a cart. Peel for your portages in the late game team fights."}
{"text": "Against katarina, Katarina\u2019s major power spike comes with finishing her first component item- giving her more sustain and more burst damage. Upon purchasing this item, Katarina will force more skirmishes and trades.\n\nOnce Katarina hits level 6, her kill pressure will intensify as her Ultimate R is a great tool and deals tons of damage. Respect her all-in once she hits level 6.\n\nKatarina is really good in team fights. Make sure you lock her down with CC as soon as she engages so she cannot get a good Ultimate R off."}
{"text": "As zyra, Work with your Jungler and Support to ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must to win the game, especially once your abilities are on cooldown."}
{"text": "Against poppy, If you meet Poppy when going through the river or if she invades your jungle, watch your positioning and avoid being close to a wall so she is unable to pin you against it with her E.\n\nDo not do any objectives if Poppy is nearby as she can knock you away with her Ultimate R and potentially steal the objective.\n\nPoppy has quite a healthy clear, so it might be difficult for you to invade her in the early game. Keep this in mind if you intend to invade or try to fight her early on."}
{"text": "Against neeko, At level 6, Neeko will be quite strong. Her Ultimate R can be used as an engage or disengage/ utility tool. Be on the lookout for her Ultimate R!\n\nNeeko will spike once she backs and gets her first component item. But, this strength depends on whether she is going AP or AD Neeko.\n\nNeeko can be really good in team fights if the enemy groups together. Avoid grouping too closely to reduce her effectiveness in fights."}
{"text": "As zac, Having three points in his Ultimate R is a massive powerspike for Xin Zhao. This will allow him to use the ability frequently, giving him an overall benefit during fights.\n\nXin will have two of his abilities maxed out by level 14. This is a significant boost to his dueling power, and it will let him dominate 1 v 1's with utmost ease.\n\nDuring this phase of the game, Xin will be really tanky while simultaneously dealing a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that he will be tough to take down, and immobile or CC'd enemy carries will mostly die if they can't get Xin away from them."}
{"text": "Against corki, When starting a team fight, you need to engage quickly. Corki will look to delay a team fight and poke with his b and e. If you engage and fight quickly, he will not have time to poke you down.\n\nAvoid trying to take objectives in the mid or late game when Corki is alive. He will just poke you down while you try to take them. Make sure you take them when he is dead or elsewhere on the map.\n\nFighting Corki can be hard alone, so your best bet is to just focus on matching his wave-pushing power and trying to stop him from taking those side objectives.\n"}
{"text": "As viego, Having 3 points in his Ultimate R will help Viego to take the game effortlessly. His brilliant damage will increase considerably, and he will melt through the enemy team. His Ultimate R will come in very practical during the fights at the end of the game. His ability to target the lowest health enemy will make a quick work of enemies who managed to escape with a burst of health. Viego is decent in the team fights, mainly if he uses the fog of the war and his E to reach the enemy backline. He can even use his E to zone the enemy out without even trying to kill anyone."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Level 16 is perfect for Qiyana because its Ultimate R will be maximized. It will do far too much damage to the enemy squishies, and that too often. Its Ultimate R is superb during the team fights. It can immediately turn the tide of a battle with a well-positioned Ultimate R and help its allies to achieve crucial goals during this phase. It will be almost complete during this phase of the game. This means that its release of damage will be phenomenal. It can dismantle an enemy team by securing selections before a meaningful fight."}
{"text": "As azir, The danger increases when you don't have your ultimate R ready. Because of your soldier positioning mechanic, any enemy champion who has a dash, or other form of mobility spell, can turn out to be a really hard target to catch and kill for you. Your own mobility can prove to be a weak point for you. If the enemy manages to bait your R in an aggressive way and then the enemy Jungler shows up for a gank, you will have a really hard time getting out of the situation without your ultimate R."}
{"text": "As kled, Kled needs some time to come online. Play safe in the game very early unless you have a favorable matchup. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can look for aggressive games and extended trades. At level 6 your pressure to kill increases and your all-in."}
{"text": "As garen, Play safe in the first levels. Garen needs a little time to come online or otherwise it will fall behind and be unable to scale. Once you have unlocked your Ultimate R, you can look to play more aggressively. Your Ultimate R can be seen as an execution and will help you finish the enemy. Once you have some levels or an element under your belt, you can look to play more aggressive and look for fighting."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Gragas can start gauntling once he has access to all 3 basic abilities. Keep this in mind and try to follow him so you can counter the gank at level 3. Like most champions, Gragas points again to level 6 that his Ultimate R is a really good tool when it comes to glove. If he goes AP, respect his damage release."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Always adjust your position in the track so Ornn is unable to crush you with his E. Get away from the walls and his Pillar Q so he is unable to CC. Refuse to use major CC capabilities on Ornn when his W is out of cooling as he can use it to avoid or escape CC. Once Ornn reaches level 6, his death pressure in the track will increase and he can start getting ganks from his Jungler. Get a vision in the river so you can spot the Jungler early."}
{"text": "As neeko, Her roaming potential can catch your teammates off guard, so alerting them allows them to play more cautiously and be prepared for potential ganks or plays from Neeko.\n\nBe cautious at level 6, as Neeko's kill pressure significantly increases  This can make the matchup more challenging for you and your ADC. Exercise caution and be prepared to play defensively, as getting caught in her ultimate can result in significant damage or death.\n\nAvoid frequently detaching from your ADC when Neeko's E (Tangle-Barbs) is available. Her root ability makes you an easy target if you separate from your ally. Instead, focus on providing sustained healing and utility from your attached position, keeping your ADC safe and secure.\n\nWhile it's important to prevent Neeko from freely pushing you under your tower, be mindful not to let the wave crash too close to your turret. This can leave you vulnerable to ganks and make it difficult to farm effectively. Aim for a balanced wave position that allows you to control the lane and trade without the risk of being ganked."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is really easy to kit. As he is still, champions with dashes, range advantage or poke make it difficult for Darius to get on and kill them. He falls at the end of the game. Darius is a starting champion in the middle of the game and once he arrives at the later stages of the game, his strengths become weaknesses. His Ultimate e is crucial in team fights to remove key targets. If he misses his Ultimate e, his release of damage will be greatly reduced and he could cost him the team fight. That's why he has to throw his Ultimate e as soon as the enemy enters the range of health."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Cho=Gath is a monster as the game continues. It can easily eat an unexpected target that wanders through the Rift of Summoners alone. If you don't know where Cho=Gath is, don't walk through the isolated river or without vision. Cho=Gath=The abilities are crucial when it comes to winning the team fight. Do not group too close together so he is unable to land his e on your entire team. When he sips a goal like Baron or Dragon, don't start if Cho=Gath is alive. With his Ultimate t, he deals more damage than Smite, so it's better not to take the 50/50."}
{"text": "As yone, Once he gets to level 16, he will use his Ultimate R way more frequently. This means he can pick off enemies easily, as well as CC multiple enemies during team fights.\n\nYone will have all his items completed by this time. This means that he will hit like a truck, and anyone who gets caught out by him will probably end up dying.\n\nYone is superb during the late game as his items will be completed, and he will have reached his most powerful powerspike. If the enemy team happens to be CC-heavy, he should get some defensive item to preserve his power."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, When Fiddlesticks gets access to 3 abilities, he is really difficult to deal with because they offer him so much utility. If you\u2019re trying to go for an all in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing.\n \nOnce Fiddlesticks has his Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass, it allows his Ultimate R to really hit home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonya\u2019s, you can\u2019t attack him when he goes into stasis.\n \nAt level 6, Fiddlesticks ganks will become stronger and he will look to constantly gank when he has his Ultimate R up. Prepare for this and try to delay his power spike for as long as possible through invading."}
{"text": "As karma, It can use its Q both poke and clear wave, which allows it to obtain the priority of the track, and its Jungler can safely invade the enemy accordingly. The first component offers a lot of poke from the end of Karma because it increases the damage of its Q and allows it to use it frequently because it will have more mana to use. Level 6 is not a huge peak, but it certainly increases the amount of poke damage that it can do with its capabilities. Its Qualified Q is a force to count with once it reaches level 6."}
{"text": "As azir, Your ability to control an area/area is quite strong and almost unmatched. You can cut down a lot of constant damage if you are lucky.

Your Ultimate R offers you luxury both disengagement and all-in-the-team enemy according to your requirement."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, It is strong once it unlocks its Ultimate R. The extra inflation potential and movement speed more other statistics of its Ultimate are really beneficial when it comes to trading. Aatrox peaks when it gets its first element (as well as the two component elements). Respect its all in potential when it has finished the recipe as its damage output will increase strongly. Aatrox is very much whatever if you can't avoid all instances of its Q. Practice makes perfect, but try to avoid them every time you are able to."}

This will allow you to get a lot of map control, and your ability to siege will be pretty respectable as well.\n\nOnce you get your core items, you should be able to dish out a lot of damage in a brief moment. If you manage to catch someone out with your W and E, they are as good as dead.\n\nUtilize your W and E properly when trying to fight for a neutral objective. Your Q can easily be spammed by you, so use it regularly.        "}
{"text": "As garen, His Passive allows him to stay in the lane even after taking a lot of poke damage/all-in damage from the enemy team. This can also bait the enemy team into wasting a lot of valuable summoner spells.\n\nHis E allows him to do more damage in 1 v 1\u2019s (as the damage is increased if the enemy is alone). This lets him do a lot of damage with one complete rotation of his abilities, and unlike Garen, the enemy probably won\u2019t be able to regenerate a lot of health and stay in the lane.\n\nHe is really good when flanking the enemy team with his Q and E. Besides that, his W tenacity will allow him to get out of the enemy team if he decides to dive in and disrupt them. Killing him is an ordeal that keeps mounting as the game goes on."}
{"text": "As thresh, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "As zac, Keep walking and try to get spikes with your Jungler. You are extremely good at it, and secure peaks should be easy due to the enemy team changing track tasks frequently. Use the war fog to catch the out-of-the-garde enemies every time you get the chance. This will allow your team to track and get easy kills on the enemy. Peel for your ADC each time, as they will be the main source of your damage in the game. Do not go blind, and make sure you have enough follow-up damage from your team."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar has great pick potential with his Ultimate R. Picking off one champion could win you the game!\n\nMalzahar has a shield that will protect him against incoming damage.

{"text": "As kassadin, Kassadin will have 2 points in his Ultimate k at level 11. This will reduce the cooling of the ability and allow him to inflict massive amounts of burst damage to the enemy. His first ability will be maximized at level 9, which will give him a boost to his damage. This helps when it comes to managing the ganks and all-in-one. Kassadin will be a monster if he is ahead of objects or kills in this game phase. Otherwise, he will not have much impact on the game."}
{"text": "As swain, Your E and W will be crucial enough to win this track. Try to land it when the enemy is about to hit a minion. You will want to be part of as many skirmishes as possible.

Try to use it if you feel you're about to be ruined or all-in'd."}
{"text": "As reksai, It can be really good at the end of the game. It's quite tanky, and its AoE damage will help her tight fights quickly.

The amount of damage inflicted will be phenomenal, especially with his E."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo gets a huge power spike at level 6. He can now focus on poking the enemy with his r tornado and then use his Ultimate R to finish the low health target off. The lane brushes should help significantly when it comes to landing this ability. \n\nYasuo will gain a small spike whenever he puts an additional point in his r. It improves his r poke damage, which allows him to look for all-ins once he hits level 6. The best time to go for an all-in is when the enemy's primary form of CC is down.\n\nOnce Yasuo gets his first item component, he will get a significant boost in his dueling potential. This means that he can easily catch up to and kill any over-extended or immobile target. He can also help his Jungler during ganks with his E dash and r knockup."}
{"text": "As sejuani, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side.

Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting with out it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As yasuo, Improper usage of his W can get him killed in the lane. This is especially true against ranged matchups.

He can\u2019t cast E on the same target twice, so he can easily be caught out.\n\nAlthough a power house, he is very squishy and can easily be burst down if he happens to mis-step.

Expect to put in a lot of work trying to learn him.\n\nIf you miss your W or get CC\u2019d once you go in, the enemy will be able to trade back with you. During the laning phase, this could be devastating if you go in at the wrong time."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim's ability to deal damage will skyrocket during this phase of the game. He will also be quite tanky due to his items and stats, which means that he will be a powerhouse of consistent DPS.\n\nOnce he gets 3 points in his Ultimate t, no enemy backline will be safe anymore. So Hecarim should use the fog of war and sit on the top side of the enemy Jungle and wait to kill any wandering enemy champion.\n\nOnce his h and W get maxed out, he will be almost unkillable as long as he is mobile and manages to stick to his target. CC is his worst enemy, so some tenacity will help him a lot."}

If Lux uses her g and missing it, use the cooldown of this aggressive ability to play because she will not be able to protect herself and prevent the effectiveness of all-in. Mitigate Lux=l standing behind and not inside the wave minion. This will make her choose between using her l for poke with or to push with."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, Nautilus is a good ganker early because he unlocks his g very early. He has the potential of gank at level 2 too. At level 6, Nautilus becomes very scary because his Ultimate e is point and click on CC. Expects that he gank every time his Ultimate e is up. The more he gets, the harder he will be to kill.

After Xin took its first component element, it can trade very aggressively with the enemy."}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Try not to group too closely as this will allow Vladimir to get a good Ultimate e Off. By separating slightly, Vladimir will have to use his Ultimate e on fewer targets.

If possible, focus him while he is in his more vulnerable state before he can deal damage.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring and when no objectives are up, Olaf may stick to a side lane and start to split push. If you can, try to use the numbers advantage to start a team fight while he\u2019s unable to assist his team."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Avoid grouping tightly together as it will give Malphite a great opportunity to land a 5 person knock up with his **Ultimate** .\n\nDo not look for fights in the jungle or around the Dragon or Baron. This is because teams will generally be grouped closely together- which allows him to get a good **Ultimate** off. Instead, try to fight in the open in a lane. \n\nPoke and disengage are Malphites biggest threats. If you can, try to poke him down as much as possible before a team fight occurs to make it near impossible for him to engage without dying. Keeping him low will force him to recall."}
{"text": "As gragas, The track brushes can allow Gragas to assert a lot of domination at the beginning of the game. It can allow him to zone the enemies, and he can also use the fog of the war to go another way and help his teammates. His Q also compensates for a bit of decent poke. Level 3 is a massive powerpike for Gragas as he can now look for full all-in on the enemy target. Positioning can cause some impediment that his E can be interrupted by minions. The use of track brushes or his Flash should quickly solve the problem. Level 6 of Gragas is an important power peak because it can now move key enemy targets during a gank or all-in. It can allow him to take the enemy rear line if he decides to go for the whole AP construction. He can also work with his Jungler and pick up enemies with this ability."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Kog'Maw will have multiple items during this phase of the game. This will result in him dealing a lot of damage to enemies and just carving a way through the enemy frontline.\n\nKog'Maw is very squishy and can be killed quickly in the late game by assassins or enemies with tons of CC. He will have to rely on his team to help him survive.\n\nGetting 3 points in his Ultimate y will amplify the poke damage dealt by the ability. It will also be a good finishing ability when dealing with low-health enemies."}

You'll really be tanky during this phase of the game so make sure you initiate the fights for your team. Let your team know before you all in, however, and keep track of your Passive. Separate the enemy rear line from the enemy front line as this will allow your allies to play more freely and keep them safe from the damage inflicted by the enemy rear line.

If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you\u2019ll be able to take the objective for free."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm needs to ensure that he activates his E mid-fight. Activating it too late is pointless because the enemy will disengage, and you will waste the shield. \n\nHe is very immobile which means he is really easy to chase down even with his W up. If the enemy freezes the lane, he cannot do anything to escape an all-in/gank.\n\nAs Tahm Kench is a melee champion, laning against ranged champions is very hard for him as they can poke him down whenever he walks forward or positions somewhat aggressively. Ranged champions can also zone him incredibly well."}
{"text": "As thresh, At level 9, Thresh will have its first maximum ability. This means that it will be able to get more choices in a short time. Thresh will have two maximum abilities at level thirteen. This will strengthen its global all-in-one potential, making it the main activator and player of the team. Thresh's main power comes from his ability to choose champions during the middle of the game. It's really important to win the game, and he will have an easy time to do it if he errs a lot."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Disengagement as soon as Neeko advances and tries to minimize the utility of his Ultimate R. Watch your flanks and bushes nearby when you sit targets like Neeko can use his Passive and W to get a good engagement with his Ultimate R. Splitting and not being too close together will help reduce the number of Neeko people and amaze with his Ultimate R. Group during team fighting, but don't stay too close together."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Quite still, which can lead him to be camped a lot during the laning phase. Once handed over at the beginning of the game, he was not able to cover much damage. Missing his E, Mordekaiser's opponents, can easily all-in and engage on him. That's because he was not able to move the enemy team, and the carts will be able to him freely. The first grise injuries can reduce his W damage by many. This will help his enemy even out of the duel during the start of the match."}
{"text": "Against sona, Catching Sona out when she goes to ward will allow your team to potentially allow you to take the Baron, Dragon or start a team fight when she is unable to protect her team.\n\nAvoid team fighting in areas where you\u2019re forced to group close together like inside an objective pit or in the jungle. This will allow Sona to get a multiperson Ultimate R. Try and group but not too close together.\n\nIn team fights, Sona will be stood next to her ADC. This might make it difficult for you to kill her. Not to worry, you could flank in team fights to make killing her or her ADC easier."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, When Xin Zhao reaches level 6, his total pressure increases. He can look for an aggressive game as soon as he gets the level. When Xin has brought his first component element, he will be really strong in 1v1 skirmishes. Keep this in mind when you try to fight it. Xin is very good in the middle of the game. Expect that he frequently searches for coins around the map, or try to kill you again and again."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Aatrox\u2019s first significant spike is at level 3 when he has access to all his basic abilities. This will allow him to go for favourable trades.\n\nOnce Aatrox gets his first component item, he will be able to go for favourable trades. Look to play more aggressive once you get your first component item.\n\nWhen Aatrox has obtained his Ultimate R; his kill pressure increases dramatically.

Once Malzhar reaches level 6, his death pressure increases thanks to his Ultimate R. Make sure you keep the river under surveillance so that you can spot his Jungler before they inflate your way like Malzhar is really not able to kill anyone alone.

Make sure you do not fall behind in XP by trying to constantly gank."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, It will continue to sting with each point in its e. This means that it will dry a lot of damage when this ability is active and will melt through the health bars. At level six, Kog'Maw will have access to its Ultimate y. This is important because the poke damage is really beneficial by taking low on the enemies of health."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Xerath will often go to pupil goals alone. Try to ambush him and catch him out of position. Then, use the number advantage to take the goal or start a team fight. Do not let Xerath shoot you down before a team fight occurs. Xerath's goal is to delay a team fight as long as possible while he launches with his p and 2. Don=t let him do it by engaging as soon as you can. Xerath will try to stay in the backline- probably behind the CDA. In a team fight, try to flank and shoot him in the start. This will make it easier for your team to win the team fight because it would not be able to shoot you down."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate n is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate n is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As garen, When no team fights are occurring, split push and draw the enemies attention to you while your team sieges or makes plays on the other side of the map.\n\nLook for picks with your Q and R. Garen deals a surprising amount of damage, so don\u2019t be afraid to move around the map and try to assassinate someone with your team.\n\nGaren is a skirmish heavy laner. When you\u2019re split pushing, look to fight anyone who tries to stop you."}
{"text": "As sion, An additional point in his Ultimate R will increase his overall damage and allow him to use the ability frequently. He will help him massively during team fighting or trying to secure peaks. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be respectable enough now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability by hiding in a brush. His tankness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will absorb the turn shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow his commitments."}
{"text": "As olaf, Olafs' Ultimate k allows him to avoid the CC because it prevents him from being blocked by the hard control of the crowd. Olafs 1v1's potential is extremely strong.

Thanks to his slowness, he can easily pursue any lantern or champion with which he comes into contact."}

Getting resets on your Ultimate e will increase your chances of winning the fight.\n\nWhen you do team fight, look to peel and focus the closest enemy champion.

{"text": "Against swain, Swain\u2019s early game is rather weak. If you\u2019re playing as an early game champion, try to get an early advantage to reduce his scaling.\n\nHis Root E will only trigger on the first enemies he hits on its return. Stand near your Caster Minions and walk forwards when he throws it out so the minions get CC\u2019d and not you.\n\nAt level 6, his kill pressure and survivability increases. Unless you have the advantage, disengage as soon as he activates his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As soraka, The half-game will ask you to be enemies and healing allies at the same time. Do not walk alone as you kill is very easy. Your placement E can make or break a fight with ease.

Do not abuse your W however, otherwise you will end up dying quickly."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Cho=Gath is powerful at level 6 because it is able to inflict real damage with its Ultimate t. Always consider its damage results whether it is built as a full tank or AP. Cho=Gath becomes stronger and stronger than the game continues. Try to close it to make it useless in team fights, or finish the game as quickly as possible so that it can not become a mega tank. Every time he has his m or e up, his survival and self-pleasure are greatly increased. Wait for him to use one of these abilities before he engages or fights him."}
{"text": "As irelia, Irelia\u2019s early game is strong. Look for plays to get an early kill on the enemy laner. If you can get one kill or get an early health lead, you\u2019re going to have an easier time during the laning phase.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, play aggressive and look for a kill.

{"text": "As kalista, Her mobility is everything in her kit. Make sure you go for short burst trades and then get out before she can get too many spears in you.\n\nWork with your Support to kill her. The best time to all-in her is when her r is down, or she is CC'd.\n\nPost-six, you will want to be careful about her Ultimate. Failing to do so will easily get you knocked up and killed.\n\nKeep the wave near your tower and see if you can expose her to ganks."}
{"text": "As nautilus, Unfortunately, Nautilus doesn\u2019t have the fastest clear in the game, but it is somewhat healthy.\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t have great objective control, so you will need your allies to help you take the Dragon and Rift Herald.\n\nCan be hard to gank your allies if the minion wave is between you and the enemy."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Trendamere is extremely strong in the way, especially when his resource bar is filled. This means that he will arrange a lot of damage and heal a lot when he uses his Q. He can exert a lot of pressure in the way while simultaneously preserving his survival. He helps a lot against the champions of range and melee. His first element will help him a lot in the way. He will give him a strong boost of damage with an increased survival that will be exceptionally useful for the duo in the way."}
{"text": "As olaf, Avoid getting caught by his Q in this matchup. Don't do it will entice Olaf to all of you once you're low. If you're looking for an all-in, make sure you commit. Get some Grievous Wounds while you're at it for maximum efficiency. Once you get your Ultimate, you should be able to look for all-in regularly. Just enter when his Q is down. Keep the wave near your turn and ask your Jungler of gank as much as you can. It will allow you to get an advance easily."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan can look for an early aggressive game once he unlocks his Q and E. He can look for an aggressive game if he has been able to intimidate the enemy down to level 1. One Akshan has supported and recovered his first component element, his release of damage and his ability to trade increases. He should look for aggressive games once he has brought his first component element. Level 6 is good for Akshan. That's because he unlocks his Ultimate. He can help him kill and execute the enemy lantern."}
{"text": "Against viego, When training with Viego, try to make sure that there is a minion, monster or crab between you and him so that he blocks the CC on his W. Viego has good objective control. Try to keep major goals monitored so that you can spot him before he is able to secure the lens for his team. If you counter gank Viego, keep an eye on him stealing your allied abilities and return the exchange. Be ready to back off if he kills and takes your ally."}
{"text": "As quinn, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing.

You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}

Trading autos will usually end in your favour- just make sure you dodge his 1\u2019s.\n\nIf you see Karthus channelling his e, try to cancel it with any CC abilities. This will reduce his and his allies chances of getting kills. \n\nKarthus will be looking to farm as much as possible early so he can unlock his Ultimate {{championSpells.KarthusFallenOne}.

{"text": "As zyra, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}

Expect him to play aggressive whenever his Ultimate R is up.\n\nZac is really good in team fights as his kit has tons of CC. Try to disengage whenever he E\u2019s in to make it harder for him to get a good knockup."}
{"text": "As neeko, Her Q allows her team to play around her and her Jungler to spoil her. Her passive combined with her Ultimate R can be a deadly combo. If she passes after JC, she can run any enemy if they don't have some form of CC capability on them."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, In team fights, use your authorized E to get choices to start the fight.

Xayah, rather weak in the beginning of the game. Try to abuse her as much as possible to get an early advantage. With a small range, she can easily be reversed and harassed. Avoid committing for prolonged trades with Xayah unless you have an advantage. Thanks to her E and W, she earns prolonged trades."}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Kassadin will be divided by pushing in the middle of the game so that he can reach his level 16 power peak and then try to flank in the team fights with his Ultimate k. If you see that Kassadin is divided by pushing, you can try to start a team fight with the advantage of numbers because he won't be able to join the fight quickly."}
{"text": "As jhin, Level 6 a significant power spike for Jhin as he can now put the final nail on the coffin of targets who managed to escape with a sliver of health. It will also allow him to pick off enemies with his Ultimate R slow.\n\nThe first item component will allow Jhin to do a lot more damage to enemies and will bolster his fourth shot effectiveness. It will help his overall laning phase by a lot.\n\nJhin's Q is both his waveclear and primary damage ability. Putting additional points in it will make it more powerful, and enemies will take a lot of damage if the early Q grenade bounces kill the designated target."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, He can also continue to poach the opposition with his W and put some Q turrets in the track/round brushes to prevent everything. He can push freely until he is in the cover of his turrets Q. These turrets, when combined with his E, can allow Heimerdinger to transform an enemy gank into an easy killer for him. His ultimate R provides him with a lot of versatility. He can use his authorized Q to remove turrets and enemies, his W authorized to destroy weak enemies, and his E authorized to put a multi-man, long-range CC that can allow his team to follow his CC."}

Make sure you push her back so she doesn\u2019t take your Tower early."}
{"text": "As kayn, He is very dependent on playing around his Passive before he gets his form. If he happens to get the wrong form early on, he will be set back massively.\n\nWith his Ultimate R, he becomes completely reliant on the positioning of the target he is in. If the target takes him under their tower and CC\u2019s them, he will take a lot of damage.\n\nHis E can be interrupted. This allows the enemy team to put him in a very disadvantageous position which can actually get him killed immediately."}
{"text": "As karthus, He gets a significant peak of power at level 11 because of his access to his level two Ultimate e. Damage is significantly increased, mainly if he managed to buy some items with it. At level 9, his 1 will be maximized. Anyone taken by Karthus will take a large piece of damage and probably die even if they are isolated by Karthus. Karthus can control much of the track during the middle of the game and choose enemies with his varied abilities. He can even slow down enemies with his wall, allowing his team to collapse and initiate fighting."}

{"text": "As shaco, You will want to enigma the track brushes with your x and use them as cover to continue cutting your opposition out. It should be quite easy to do during the start of the game. Your e is not reliable enough during the start of the game so do not move invade or try to cheese the enemy Jungler. You can easily collapse on if you are caught out. Level 6 will be a big peak for you as you will be able to deposit a lot of damage and your clone can easily disrupt a fight."}
{"text": "As volibear, He is countered really hard by Grievous Wounds as it prevents him from healing by a lot, thereby reducing his tower dive and all-in potential.\n\nBeing scattered in a team fight will prevent him from getting a massive Ultimate R off, and changing the tide of a team fight. His trading power is lower when his Ultimate R is on cooldown.\n\nHis main goal is to get a lead early on by ganking constantly. Proper vision set-up can counter this, forcing him to play a more farm-oriented Jungle style, which will ultimately hamper his potential."}
{"text": "As warwick, Is not the best champion when behind, however, he can build full tank and be the tank for his team. His Ultimate R will also be helpful.\n\nIf the enemy zones him away from farm, it will be difficult for Warwick to pick up gold and XP.

{"text": "As velkoz, Very motionless and therefore vulnerable to crowd control in layers. He can't push freely unless he already knows where the enemy Jungler is, otherwise, he's just going to be killed. His E is his only source of self-peel. The abuse of him makes him much more vulnerable to all-in and can probably have him killed almost instantly if the enemy lantern has some kind of wink or mixed crowd control. His Ultimate R root in place, which makes it very easy for enemy champions with varying crowd control to interrupt his Ultimate R and get on him with their team."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Once Kai'Sa gets three points in her Ultimate R, she will have a massive shield and can reposition instantly if things go awry during fights.\n\nShe will have many upgraded abilities during this phase of the game.

{"text": "As janna, As you\u2019re a Support, avoid warding alone in the late game. If you get picked off, the enemy will be able to take nearby objectives or use their numbers advantage to win a team fight.\n\nConsistently place vision around the map to help your team secure objectives and get picks. Having vision around the Baron and Dragon is needed to help your team to victory.\n\nIn the late game, make sure you\u2019re with your team at all times.

{"text": "Against aurelionsol, Aurelion can use its R or E capabilities to turn team fights instantly. Make sure you don't stand in a cluster while watching the team fight. This is especially true when you hunt, sit or fight in the jungle. Awards and good communication is the key to Aurelion Sol. Make sure you have the river monitored at all times, and ping if it is missing. Don't be afraid to write in the cat that it also lacks. CC is your best friend against Aurelion Sol. If you can lock it with CC, it will be difficult for him to adjust his positioning and escape. Moreover, as he has a poke champion, lock him up with CC as quickly as you can make it harder for him to do damage in the team fight."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Do not do anything that implies that you push into enemy territory. If the enemy extends too far, just use your e to get damage on them.

Now you can get the enemy out of the way without breaking any kind of sweat while keeping the distance from the enemy."}

{"text": "As lux, Stand outside the minion wave so it can't push you and push you with its E. But, stand behind the minion wave instead so it can't put its Q on you while you're isolated. Its level 6 is much stronger than yours. Make sure you play safely and backwards if you're on low HP. Focus on agriculture at the beginning of the game.

He has great poke thanks to his Q, W and R which will make it difficult for your team to secure the objective easily. \n\nAvoid fighting in chokepoints like inside the jungle as it will give Vel\u2019koz an easier time landing his E, doing damage with his W and melting your team with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As zyra, Your immobility is your greatest weakness on Zyra. Therefore, you should always be aware of your positioning in the way and in team fighting.

{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao will have two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. It will allow him to use the ability more often, which will make it easier for him to convert fighting to 1 v 1 as and when necessary. His first ability will be maximized at the time he reaches level 9. It is a crucial peak of power because he massively increases his damage production and duel ability. Xin is excellent in team fighting and collecting enemies because of his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to distinguish enemies, allowing him to be immune to various maneuvers."}

If you can catch out the enemy Support, you can rotate to Baron or Dragon or force a fight with the numbers advantage.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gone in, make sure you fall back and peel for your allies.

Having the vision around the major goals is the key."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas reaches level 16, he will have his Ultimate R maximd out. This will give him a massive increase in damage, and the low cooling combined with the return to normal will help him to choose high priority targets. Gragas will either be extraordinarily charent or a glass cannon depending on the landing of his combo depending on the construction. As a middle, Gragas will mostly be the last, so his main goal will be to blow up the enemy rear line when he gets lucky. His dash and Ultimate R compile for a huge amount of peel for his carts. If he goes on the course of construction of the tank, he will successfully absorb a lot of damage for his team while his team follows the Gragas commitment."}
{"text": "As renata, During the middle of the game, you can be able to focus on roaming and guard it easily. Use your Q for self-peel in case you get caught. Make sure you play around the vision as much as you can in the game. Enemies will certainly try pre-ward brushes to store on Control Wards. Stay around your team and don't waste on anything else you can lose opportunities for massive team battle victories. One thing you need to focus on is guard and your safety."}
{"text": "As zilean, At level 11, Zilean will be very difficult to manage. His Ultimate will keep him or a key target alive and will make life of assassins a living nightmare. At level 9, his Q will be maximized and will allow him to inflict tons of damage with a single bomb. He helps a lot when executing his combo Q > W > Q. The damage and utility of Zilean in a given fight is not questionable. He can speed up his allies out of trouble, restart them, or use them as a Q transport mechanism. Similarly, he can slow down enemies, CCs, and allow his team to collapse on them."}
{"text": "Against leblanc, LeBlanc is an Assassin. This means that if she's ahead of the start of the game, she can really make snowballs and grab the game. Don't exaggerate or exchange aggressively when you know she can kill you.

As she's an Assassin, she can easily shoot you if you're out of position. To counter Leblanc in team fights, you need the CC as soon as she uses her W. Once she's in your team, CC immediately and focus all your efforts to get her down while she's CC."}

Try your best to take advantage of Jinx when she is in the lane alone.\n\nJinx is rather defenceless outside of her Flash when her E is down. If she uses her E, try and exploit her weakness and use the long cooldown to go for another skirmish. "}
{"text": "As twitch, Twitch's early play is strong enough as it can shoot down enemies with its e while slowing them down with its k. The track brushes will help him a lot. Level six is a colossal peak of power because it allows Twitch to impact and disrupt the fighting massively. It will be a devastating tool in the enclumed fighting. Its first component element will increase its potential duel significantly. Its ability to cut down damage in the track will also skyrocket."}

Once they\u2019re low enough, you can commit to an all-in.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve hit level 6 and purchased key component items, look to harass and constantly push the enemy into their tower.

This will reduce Maokai\u2019s effectiveness. "}
{"text": "As karma, Whenever Karmas d is down, she is vulnerable to attack and will need to play safely while he is on cooldown. Karma is squishy, and if she seeks to fight when he is down, she will come worse than the enemy. Unlike most champions, Karma unlocks her Ultimate has level 1. This means that at level 6, she doesn't have as much pressure compared to many other Supports. Pre-6, it's not a problem however. In team fights, you need to make sure that you use your d on your allies and avoid using your Q. Using bad autonomy can cost you the team fight."}

Irelia is a good duelist and will be able to fight most enemies who try to stop her.\n\nWhile you\u2019re a champion that is usually sent to split push, you might need to group with your team if the enemy is trying to force something. Be prepared to rotate around the map and help them fight."}
{"text": "Against annie, Annie is clearly stronger when her dizziness is ready, and when she has 3 piles on her passive.

{"text": "As xinzhao, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the team fights at the end of the game. To make it easier to get to the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you're flanking a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the game at the end of the game because the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is standing. Fighting without that will make the team fighting at the end of the game much more difficult."}
{"text": "As maokai, Don't fight at the end of the game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or search for fights when it's available. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the last stages of the game.

If your allies die quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}

This means that she can a-shot enemies in the last game in a combo."}
{"text": "Against viktor, Avoid fighting around the goals because Viktor has a lot of poke with his y. His Ultimate m also inflicts AOE damage that will help him force you away from the goal. Viktor's work in team fights is poke as much as he can before engaging in the fight. Try to force a fight as quickly as you can rather than allow him to shoot you down with his y and m. In team fights, flancing on the side or creating different angles of approach to go to him. It will make it really hard for him to survive the team fight."}
{"text": "Against akali, Once Akali has finished her first article, her death pressure increases and her damage release too. Respect her total pressure once she has finished it. Akali is capable of champions all hardened at level 6 because she gets tons of mobility and damage thanks to her Ultimate. If she hasn't played aggressively before level 6, expect her to do so once she has reached the level. Try not to give Akali kills in the early game. She is a heavy snowball champion and once she has some gold under her belt, she can easily take the card."}

Abuse this fact by heavily ganking in the early game to get ahead as Diana\u2019s chances of getting a successful countergank is extremely minimal.\n\nRek\u2019Sai and Diana have around the same dueling power post-6 if even. Only attempt to 1v1 Diana if you already have a decent item lead and your ultimate is off cooldown. Diana's t has a short enough cooldown to the point it'll always be up in a duel, so make sure your r is always up before invading.\n\nDiana is extremely immobile pre-6 which makes her easy prey for Rek\u2019Sai in the early game.

The reduction of the cooldown and the additional damage make her a huge threat during this stage of the game. Cass should have her tear stacked by this stage of the game. She will have a little endless mana pool once he is exhausted. At level 9, Cass goes max on her E. As long as she lands her Q, her brute potential will be incredibly powerful.

{"text": "As hecarim, Its increased speed of motion on its p can allow it to run down enemies with ease. This is particularly applicable to immobile carriers who rely on their team to live. The h allows it to inflict constant damage while reducing its cooling on capacity. This allows it to take extended trades during the laning. Its Ultimate t can be a game change in a team fight where the enemy is grouped. The CC allows it to separate key targets from their team and kill them quickly with its damage."}
{"text": "As nasus, The later the game goes, the stronger Nasus will be. The more stacks he has on his Q, the stronger he will be.\n\nAt level 16, Nasus will put the final point in his Ultimate R.

{"text": "As varus, Very motionless and can be easily killed if crowd control is superimposed on him. All-in Supports hiding in a trackbrush while waiting naturally goes to him the zoner of the minion wave. Extremely vulnerable while his Ultimate R is down. He can be flanked with ease so and assassins can easily get rid of him if his team forgets to peel for him. Misuse of his E can lead to lost team fights."}
{"text": "Against vex, At level 6, Vex will unlock its Ultimate R. Its pressure of death and pressure take increases considerably at this stage of the game. The more golden Vex is under its belt, the stronger it will be. Respect its release of damage after recovering its first component. When Vex completes its Mythic element, its clear wave and poke in the way will become devastating. Watch for your positioning and stay out of the minion wave."}
{"text": "As leona, After level 6, it's important to stay attached to your ADC as Leona can easily all-in and engage on you if you're separated.\n\nPay attention to Leona's E (Zenith Blade) cooldown. Take the opportunity to detach from your ADC when she wastes her E, allowing you to poke or reposition safely.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your turret to limit Leona's all-in potential. This provides a safer position for you and makes it harder for Leona to engage on you and your ADC.\n\nIf Leona roams, focus on punishing the enemy ADC by trying to secure a kill or applying pressure. Leona is known for her roaming potential, so anticipate her leaving the lane frequently."}
{"text": "As milio, Putting the final skill point in your Ultimate at level 16 is a good power spike for you. Your Ultimate will be on its lowest cooldown and will be vital in helping your team win team fights.\n\nTeams will be grouped in the late game, so you will truly shine at this stage of the game. \n\nIn the late game, you\u2019ll have multiple items completed which is key. Your healing and survivability should be quite high in the late game."}
{"text": "As camille, She should be careful to get invaded during the first parts of the game. Setting up a vision around the Jungle's entrances into the river should help her to detect invasions early.

{"text": "As diana, At level 16 and with 3 points in her Ultimate R, the damage to AOE Diana and all the potential will be extremely high. As the teams will regroup in the last game, she will be able to inflict a lot of damage to several enemies at once. While Diana will inflict a lot of damage in the fights of the late game team, it can be more difficult for her to targets at one stroke because the enemies will start building defensive elements to protect them from her burst."}
{"text": "As pyke, Keep a constant eye on what the main goal is for next spawning. If it is soon spawning, make sure to place the vision around the goal as quickly and safely as possible before going back to safety. Having the vision around the main goals is the key.

If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to earn more gold and maybe take a turn, a goal or get more dead. Move around the map and look to help your allies."}

It helps a lot against both ranged and melee champions.\n\nHis first item component will help him a lot in the lane. It will give him a heavy damage boost with increased survivability which will be exceptionally useful for dueling in the lane.        "}
{"text": "As chogath, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nUse your e to initiate a fight or try to pick someone off with it and then kill them. Once they\u2019re dead, either move to Baron or the Elder Dragon or siege and try to end the game.\n\nMake the call for objectives like the Baron or Elder Dragon when an enemy is dead and when your Ultimate t is up.

{"text": "As sona, If you wanted, you could get some early healing reduction elements to help reduce the healing of Sona. It will kill them much easier too. Make sure that the minion wave is positioned closer to your side of the map so that your Jungler can gank your way and easily kill Sona. Their Ultimate offers them a ton of extra pressure to kill. Play smart and remember when you are weak so Sona can't use their Ultimate to run you."}
{"text": "As swain, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle track and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently."}
{"text": "As akshan, You can use your E more liberally to get murders from now on. Your Ultimate will be on a short cooling time, to make sure you use it quite frequently. It will certainly help you cut off enemies who have already taken damage. If you have allies who have CC integrated into their kit, try to stay close to them. You should always focus on target CC'd and kill them when you get a chance. Also, if the enemy has a murderer, try to shade them and see if you can get the murder on them if they assassinate your allies."}

Don't ever try to leave the objective to get a few kills as the enemy Jungler may easily steal it.\n\nSet up death brushes inside the enemy jungle and help your Support ward around the Jungle when they are trying to invade.

{"text": "Against yone, Yone is incredibly mobile in the way, but if he uses his E, you can abuse cooldown (after he's returned) to play aggressively and push him down. This will make it harder for him to survive an exchange or come back with you. Avoid running too far when Yone uses his E as he will always return to his original place. Playing as a varied champion, try to use your range advantage to harass and hit him down. Try and stay away although he is unable to reach you very easily."}

{"text": "As jarvaniv, At level thirteen, both his e and d will be maxed out, and he will be able to look for picks more often. The best place to do so will be in the unwarded areas of the map and in choke points.\n\nOnce he gets to level 16, he will have 3 points in his Ultimate m. This increases the overall damage output and will let Jarvan use the ability quite often. It will help his team follow up on fights with ease.\n\nJarvan becomes really tanky during the late game. It not only allows him to be an active engager for his team but also lets him survive all-ins and peel for his carries during significant fights."}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, Look out for ambushes around the map. He is really good at starting skirmishes and picking off weak and immobile champions. Keep this in mind and avoid walking around the map alone.\n\nIn team fights, once they go in with their d, they have nothing to offer and will be in an overextended position. Use their forward positioning to play aggressive and take them down.\n\nTry to constantly poke and harass him. Having him on low health will prevent him from playing or positioning aggressively."}

Your Ultimate R is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on.

He can also use it to interrupt abilities and enemy dashes."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble is excellent during the end-of-game fights that its Ultimate b and its basic capabilities will all hit like a truck now, especially during the team fights. Maxing its Ultimate b will reduce the cooldown of the ability and allow it to use it frequently. This will be a decisive factor during the objective fights. Rumble will dry up a lot of damage during this phase of the game. Its ability to melt through the enemy health bars will force its enemies to play defensively."}
{"text": "As twitch, Just like in the mid-game, you should stick with your Support throughout the later parts of the game.

{"text": "Against fiora, If you are unhappy with the marked area, returning to a certain distance will reset the position. Playing around the W of Fiora is a focal point of the track. Try to bait it before you all in it to prevent it from neglecting your CC.

As he is immobile, champions with dashes, range advantage or poke make it difficult for Darius to get on to them and kill them.\n\nHe falls off in the late game. Darius is an early to mid game champion and once it gets to the later stages of the game, his strengths become weaknesses.\n\nHis Ultimate e is crucial in team fights to take down key targets.

The only thing to be kept in mind is that this ability is not an escape tool.\n\nHer first component will undoubtedly allow her to deal more damage in the lane and cast her spells with a higher frequency due to the increased mana pool. It will also increase the overall damage output during a significant fight.\n\nAn RNG component of her powerspike includes which spell she picks up with her W.

{"text": "As twitch, Its positioning is important in team battles as well, otherwise it can be flanked by enemy assassins and be immediately removed. Without its Ultimate c or s, its ability to dominate a team struggle decreases considerably. The fight during this stage will give the enemy team a much greater chance of winning. Virtually gets counterbalanced by a Control Ward because it forces it to reroute. It is because of the short-term nature of its automatic attacks, which makes it detect quite easily."}
{"text": "Against kled, Kled will always be stronger when he is mounted. He is slightly weaker when he is dismounted.\n\nAt level 6, Kled has increased mobility and the potential to impact multiple lanes with his Ultimate R.

Avoid team fighting during the middle of the game unless you have your Ultimate R up. When it's on the cooldown, you'll miss out on a lot of support and damage, so it's vital that you play around this cooldown of abilities."}
{"text": "As zac, As soon as the enemy advances or surpasses, he can look to play aggressively. His passive and ultimate R can allow him to take a group of enemies alone out of a large combat team by simply zoning them. He can also inflict a lot of damage to the enemy's rear line if they ignore Zac. Zac has good support in the way, thanks to his blobs. Additional health and maintenance allows him to survive more difficult matches and heal the enemy."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio's damage will increase by a lot once he gets his first item. It will allow his Q and E to hit like a truck during all-ins.\n\nOnce Galio hits level 6, he unlocks the ability to make cross-map plays around the map. This is advantageous for his team and will let you impact the game a lot more.\n\nSince Galio has limited range, he will have a hard time early during the game. However, he can use his Q to bypass this. When using his Q, he should try to hit the enemy champion for bonus points."}
{"text": "As kindred, Its kitting potential makes it a very safe choice against the melee champions who don't have a dash or have a very telegraphed form of a dash. The Q combined with its W allows it just to jump around and peel its enemies endlessly. Once it gets some passive marks, it can easily resume the game due to the increased range and how many damage bonuses it can extinguish. It can solo the Dragon with ease and can use its Q to jump on the walls and take creative ganking routes. Its Ultimate R can save its team and itself from assassination attempts. The use will vary according to the distance to come Kindred is in the game. This ability can also delay a goal for some time, which can allow Kindred to win a battle of Smite by forcing the enemy to Smite at the wrong time."}
{"text": "Against singed, Expect that Singed will stay away from his team during the middle and end of the game. He will try to divide the thrust and take goals. Make sure that someone who can challenge it is sent on a side track to stop it. Force team fights when Singed is unable to influence them is a great idea and force a 4v4 or 5v4 fight will help you win the game. If Singed joins the team fight, you will have to disengage and retreat whenever he commits otherwise he could use his g to Fling someone in his team. Unengage and poke will reduce his chances of getting a good goff."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Lissandra will use her Q & E to push the wave. Stand outside the minion wave so she is forced to choose between pushing with her Q or trying to poke you instead. When Lissandra is level 6, you will need to play a little safer because she has increased the pressure to kill and can install her Jungler very easily. Make sure you have enough vision around your path to spot the enemy Jungler before they show up and spank you. When you play as a melee champion, try to stay at maximum range at any time so it is harder for Lissandra to you CC with her W. Be careful when you walk forward for the last strike, and play respectfully if she zoning you to not take tons of damage."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Drive and kill several enemies during this phase of the game. Remember that you can cross very quickly because of your Passive so make use of it. Pull the pressure while your team tries to sit targets elsewhere to open the map. You can also try to sneak some goals when your team is busy distracting the enemy. Always try to take all of it and take the enemy Jungler every chance you get. Doing so will allow you to take neutral goals easily."}
{"text": "As rell, Each level is a power spike for Rell because it gives her all-in potential, CC, and sustain, respectively, if she goes for the regular t, E, Q point route. Her all-in potential is increased massively once she hits level 3.\n\nLevel 6 a significant power spike, and she can be highly effective during clumped fights. It will be helpful during fights near the objective pits as well, as it can completely CC multiple enemies, allowing her team to kill them all.\n\nBoots are a major power spike as she can now roam around easily and can stick to enemies with ease. It will also allow her to get to Jungle skirmishes faster than anyone else."}
{"text": "As kalista, Stay with your Support throughout the mid-game. If you move away from them, you will be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you\u2019re always near at least 1 ally.\n\nGroup and stay with your team at all times. Do not split push or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against kassadin, Kassadin is very weak in early play. Try to exploit this to win an advance and prevent him from taking the card. Giving him a difficult start will reduce his scale. Once Kassadin has his Ultimate k, he will be able to trade more frequently and also escape danger. At this point, his death pressure also increases. Kassadin is a game monster later and once level 16, he will be very slippery thanks to his Ultimate k and short cooldowns. Try and finish before having a chance to reach level 16."}
{"text": "Against teemo, As Teemo is a varied champion, expect him to try to harass you as much as possible. Investing in defensive starting objects could be a good way to deal with him from going back and forth. Teemo will place Shrooms t around the edges of the track. Avoid walking on the side of the track and only walk the path that your minions take to reduce your damage taken. Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP and health. Teemo has a lot of pressure to kill if he takes Ignite and is able to harass you and make you fall."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn doesn't have a duelling Ultimate R. This makes her low position level 6 when it comes to all in. She can't fight right 5v5. She will need to flank in team fights. If the enemy has the vision or knows where she is, she will be unable to fight team properly and will be forced to divide the thrust. You are a champion who is inclined to all-in and CC. Mix this with the fact that Quinn is squishy enough, it can be difficult to deal with enemy teams that have a lot of CC."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, If Tryndamere has Ignite, expect him to play aggressively and look for an all-in at level 2 or 3. Once Tryndamere reaches level 6, his survival increases a ton. Avoid committing yourself to fight with him when his Ultimate e is up unless you can easily beat him in a skirmish. Tryndamere is really good in the late game and will watch constantly divide the thrust and take goals. Do not let him take your laps for free while you skim in the middle track."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax needs time to come online. Although he can trade in the early game, it's best to get a few levels behind you before looking for a murder. Be ready to scale if you're in a difficult matchup so that you don't fall behind and become useless in the later parts of the game. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card in difficult matchesups. Jax will find it really difficult to survive the laning phase if it constantly pushes."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton will seek to divide the thrust when no team fight occurs. Make sure that someone who can challenge him prevents him from pushing. Do not send someone who is unable to beat him to prevent him from pushing. For his e to be effective, he will have to get as close as possible to the enemy in a team fight. With this in mind, Renekton will probably try to flank in a team fight rather than run towards you. Make sure that your flanks are monitored so that you can spot him before he has the chance to engage."}
{"text": "As soraka, Harass the enemy throughout the laning phase with your Q. Your goal is to constantly harass the enemy whenever possible and get murders. After destroying the tower of the lower lane, turn to the middle track and try to take this tower. This will open the map and give your team a gold advance. Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the goal to make it easier to secure the tower of the medium track. Keep a constant eye on the minimap and your health of your allies. Use your ultimate R on the low allies who are able to turn and win the fight or survive. Avoid losing your ultimate R on the allies who will die even with your ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ensure that you\u2019re always stood behind a minion at all times to make it harder for him to land his Q and poke you down. \n \nThe best time to go for trades and land skill shots on Ezreal is when his E is on cooldown. If he ever uses it aggressively, try to abuse the cooldown and look for an aggressive play while he\u2019s defenceless. \n \nIf Ezreal uses his Ultimate R to snipe someone on the map, ping your team as it moves across Summoners Rift. This will allow them to dodge the incoming ability. While this ability is on cooldown, you could look to play aggressive and try to fight him."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Avoid grouping too close together otherwise, Lissandra will be able to engage with her E and land a multi-person W.  If you can, try to split up slightly so she can only hit 1 or 2 champions at the most.\n\nPlay around Lissandra\u2019s Ultimate R cooldown. Once it\u2019s on cooldown, she is rather vulnerable and cannot team fight properly. You can use this to your advantage to force team fights when you know it\u2019s hard for her to fight.\n\nLissandra has tons of wave clear, so sieging objectives in the mid and late game is going to be tricky. Keep this in mind and try to take her down or poke her out of lane so she cannot defend her Turrets."}
{"text": "As maokai, In the middle of the game, your main goal will be to look for as many choices as possible. Working with your support to help them frame your E by throwing themselves into Jungle's brushes. You should be really tanky during this phase of the game. Peeling for your carts should be your main goal after successfully launching team fights. The river and choking points would be a great place to fight because your abilities will lock several enemies. Just enter on the highest priority target and try to lock them up CC."}
{"text": "As vladimir, Focus on agriculture and get as much gold and XP as possible. You need time and gold before you can come online and inflict damage. Your champion is incredibly weak in early play. Focus on agriculture and avoid fighting with the enemy until you have an article behind you. After your bot track moved to the middle track, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. Fight no one unless you have an advantage over them. Continue to get XP and gold."}
{"text": "As rengar, The first item component will allow him to deal a lot of damage and be really obnoxious in the lane. It will also be beneficial when trying to go for all-in combos.\n\nLevel six is a decent spike for him as he can now burst enemies down easily and roam around the map. His survivability will also depend on his Passive usage.\n\nHe is a powerful and annoying champion early on, especially if he manages to use the lane brushes to his advantage in the lane. His all-in combo will be pretty potent if he catches her enemies off-guard.        "}
{"text": "As shen, Peel for your carries in late game team fights to increase the chances of your team winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce doesn't really spike at level 6 due to his Ultimate G from level one. This also means that he has access to three more ability variations than his opponent. He should use them to get a lead pre-6.\n\nJayce is weak early on and does rely on his w > s combo to poke enemies out before going for a kill. This will allow him to garner a lead and burst the enemy down once they are low enough. The lane brushes are to be used relentlessly to ensure swift domination of the lane.\n\nThe first component will give a damage boost to Jayce and will let him play more aggressively. It will allow Jayce to go for frequent burst trades after poking the enemy out with his w > s combo."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Another point in his Ultimate a will allow him to take more fights around the map. His presence will be felt around the map, and the enemy will have difficulty pushing up.\n\nHe is pretty solid during the mid-game due to his gank potential. He can quickly turn the tide of a fight with his Ultimate a and use it defensively to scare off enemies.\n\nNocturne deals a lot of damage during the mid-game. He will have access to his core items and can easily pick enemies off when rotating alone.        "}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Having three points in his Ultimate R is a massive powerspike for Xin Zhao. This will allow him to use the ability frequently, giving him an overall benefit during fights.\n\nXin will have two of his abilities maxed out by level 14. This is a significant boost to his dueling power, and it will let him dominate 1 v 1's with utmost ease.\n\nDuring this phase of the game, Xin will be really tanky while simultaneously dealing a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that he will be tough to take down, and immobile or CC'd enemy carries will mostly die if they can't get Xin away from them."}
{"text": "As kayn, In the mid-game, you should be working with your teammates to secure picks around the map. This will be highly beneficial if you go for the Darkin form.\n\nGank other lanes frequently, especially the over-extended ones. This is going to allow you to help your teammates and share your lead with your allies.\n\nIf you happen to go for the Blue form, your main goal will be to invade the enemy backline and kill the squishies. You should only be dealing with the frontliners if you go for Red Kayn."}
{"text": "As lucian, Very vulnerable when his E is down which can allow him to be very susceptible to ganks. Enemy Junglers can take this opportunity to camp him relentlessly.\n\nReliant on items to win the game. If he is set back during the early game, he won\u2019t be able to do a lot in the late game as he just falls off.\n\nIf he manages to get an early lead, he may be able to snowball if left unchecked. He falls off massively though so the longer the game goes, the worse it is for Lucian."}
{"text": "Against trundle, Stand in the middle of the lane rather at the sides of the lane. If you stand around the edges near the wall, you are allowing him to set up his Jungler with a quick and easy Pillar e.\n\nAs Trundle\u2019s Passive regenerates health every time a minion dies, he will get a lot of extra sustain in lane. Try to get an early Executioner\u2019s Calling to reduce his healing.\n\nTrundle is good at level 2 and 3. Avoid fighting him unless you\u2019re as strong as him, or if you have lots of sustain too. He will be able to out sustain you from every trade if you commit to them early on. "}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Once Fiddlesticks has his Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass, it allows his R to really hit home. If he channels his R and uses his Zhonya\u2019s, you can\u2019t attack him when he goes into stasis.\n \nWhen Fiddlesticks gets access to 3 abilities, he is really difficult to deal with because they offer him so much utility. If you\u2019re trying to go for an all in, make sure to fight when 1 ability is missing.\n \nOf course, Fiddlesticks biggest power spike is his level 6. You can counter it by having constant wards around your lane. If he goes missing post 6, ping your teammates."}
{"text": "As talon, Focus on getting peaks around the map during this phase of the game, as you will be able to find many squishy targets wandering around. Your E should allow you to win fights much more effectively as it makes you very slippery and allows you to catch out-of-guard enemies. Try to kill the enemy Jungler before taking a neutral goal. This will help you secure the goal without any obstacles, and you will have easier time to win the game."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Level six is when Nocturne ends up becoming a global threat to the enemy team. It can easily wander around and get free murders. Its early game laning is quite strong. It can easily wave and get on enemies quickly. The first component will allow Nocturne to the enemy duel easily and inflict massive damage to the enemy team during the fighting."}
{"text": "Against viego, When skirmishing with Viego, try to make sure there is a minion, monster or crab in between you and him so it blocks the CC on his W.\n\nViego has good objective control. Try to keep major objectives warded so you can spot him before he is able to secure the objective for his team.\n\nIf you counter gank Viego, keep an eye out on him stealing your allies abilities and turning the exchange around. Be prepared to fall back if he kills and takes over your ally."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Try to roam and get kills in different parts of the map.

Your abilities make it possible to one-shot enemies as soon as you get your core items.        "}
{"text": "As nami, Nami has lots of poke thanks to her W and E. This can allow her to poke the enemy down and win trades with ease. She can also use her W to heal herself back up if a trade goes poorly.\n\nHas lots of kill pressure in the laning phase and in the mid game with her Q and Ultimate R. This makes her a huge threat in team fights.\n\nCan keep her allies topped up with HP thanks to her W and the items she will pick up.

{"text": "As nilah, When her E is down, she's pretty easy to lock and she can't play aggressively either. To get the maximum use of her Ultimate R, she needs her team to follow or enter at the same time. Like most champions, Nilah is pretty weak when she's behind."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, Miss Fortunes poke in the early game will be really boring to deal with. Investing in a Rechargeable Potion will help you stay alive in this matchup. Post 6, standing in the middle of the way so that it is harder for Miss Fortune to get the full channel of her Ultimate e on you. When you are standing in the open, you will have easier time to avoid her ultimate damage e. Stay away from the weak health minions that Miss Fortune can use for you poke with her t."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Place vision inside and near his jungle entrances. This will reduce his usefulness and his ability to gank as your team can see him before he arrives at their lane. This will also reduce his ability to successfully use his Ultimate.\n\nFiddlesticks will be trying to powerfarm until level 6 where he gains access to his Ultimate. Try to invade him if you spot him on the opposite side of the map to delay his level 6 power spike.\n\nUnless you can surprise him (such as attacking from inside a bush), it will be quite difficult to kill him alone as he will often use his Q and then run away. If you invade, try to stick to the bushes to make fighting him easier. Alternatively, team up with an ally and try to collapse on him.\n\nAs Fiddlesticks will be power farming, try to get your allies ahead by ganking as much as possible. This will make it harder for him to gank once he is 6 as they will be stronger."}
{"text": "As zilean, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in the way. You have a lot of poke, so try poke the enemy down as often as you can. Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your Q. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Vladimir is at his lowest level in the early game. Try your hardest to put it behind to make it less heinous in the middle and end of the game. At level 9, Vladimir would have maximized Q. It has a short cooldown and deals a lot of damage. Avoid letting it use on you too. Vladimir is really good in the late game and in team fights. Try to finish the game as quickly as you can so it is unable to peak."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Trading against Heimerdinger can be extremely tedious, yet it can be done. Taking down his Turrets Q will be the main focus in order to poke or trade with him.\n \nWhen using your skills shots (if they\u2019re AOE), try and aim them so they hit both Heimerdinger and his Turrets Q. This will make it easier for you to clear them down the line and increase your kill pressure in lane.\n \n Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, his kill pressure and strength increase dramatically. Keep this in mind and beware of his empowered abilities."}
{"text": "As graves, This is very beneficial for the enemy team, because they can focus it quickly, get rid of it, and then go to neutral goals. The enemies can avoid its automatic attacks by keeping minions and the tower between them and him. It is because of its passive and can easily lead to an out-of-play for the enemy, especially if the enemy gank target has built a large wave of minions. Using its negligent, or very aggressively, can lead to its immediate killing. The ability has a moderately high cooling, and if the enemy does not allow it to self-attack by doing it or by other means, it is not able to use its e frequently and will eventually die."}
{"text": "As veigar, With this in mind, play safer at level 6 and keep your distance so that you have more time to react to its cage + combo all-in-one. Stay away from the minion wave so it can't push you and fall at the same time. Play around its cooldown E. If you keep it away, abuse the long cooldown to gain an important benefit on health. Try and force it to extend for the farm by keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map. You, your Support and your Jungler can then get it down on the long track."}
{"text": "As graves, Graves gets out scaled and unless he got ahead during the early game, it is unlikely that he will take over the game in the later parts of the game.\n\nHe is squishy and getting CC\u2019d will get him killed really fast. This is highly beneficial for the enemy team, as they can focus him down quickly, get rid of him, and then go for neutral objectives.\n\nThe enemy laner can prevent him from dealing damage with his auto-attacks by hiding inside or behind minions. Due to Graves\u2019 Passive, he always autos the nearest target."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. Trendamere has a lot of pressure to kill and if you push, it could easily all within you and you continue in the way. Look for fights when he has little Fury in his resource bar. The more Fury he has, the stronger he will be. Every time his Ultimate e is down, try to abuse cooldown and look for killers. Once his Ultimate e is up, his pressure of death and survival increases a lot."}
{"text": "Against twitch, Don't clump up or stick close together in team fights versus Twitch as his Spray and Pray c will melt you. Spread out and look for a way to burst him down once he reveals himself.\n\nTwitch will often get incredibly close to your team after popping out of his s. Once he has left it, try to take him down as quickly as you can.\n\nControl Wards are essential in team fights. Place Trinkets and Control Wards around you when sieging an objective to spot Twitch before he is able to jump out on you."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Hitting level 3 will be quite hard so make sure you avoid conflicts and use your Q to heal up regularly. This will allow you to soon become gank-worthy.\n\nFocus on getting your core items as quickly as you can. You are heavily reliant on them and will be able to run enemies down if you manage to get a quick lead.\n\nWhen ganking, make sure that the enemies are overextended. This will make it supremely easy for you to slow and kill enemies."}
{"text": "As jax, Similarly, avoid engaging if he has his E available. As Jax is so weak early, just go into their jungle and try to fight them or force them to remember. Putting them behind will delay their power peak. Try to take Dragons as often as possible. This is the key to getting yourself and your allies in advance. As you are much stronger than Jax early on, make sure to get an early lead by gaunting your allies before Jax even has a chance to come online."}
{"text": "As khazix, His Q allows him to achieve secure goals quickly, as well as to get dead on isolated targets with ease. His E evolved and Ultimate R allow him to perform multiple out-of-games and escapes in situations where any other champion would probably be killed. The reset is an additional bonus to this ability and can be used to secure several dead in a short period of time. The isolation part of his kit allows him to 1 v 1 any champion who is alone next door. This is particularly true when it comes to dealing with money carrier champions who try to catch a lateral wave."}
{"text": "Against lucian, In team fights, take care that Lucian can use his E to reposition and escape danger. Try and wait for him to use his  E before using your CC abilities so it\u2019s harder for him to dodge them. \n\nAvoid letting Lucian get a full channel of his Ultimate R on you in a team fight by disengaging or cancelling it with CC. \n\nLookout for Lucian\u2019s positioning. He will often walk forward in order to land auto attacks. Once he has mispositioned, use this to your advantage to focus him down."}
{"text": "As draven, He has a unique mechanic that makes him incredibly hard to master. Playing around his g is crucial for a good Draven, and it does take some time to get used to. \n\nIf you die when you have lots of stacks, you\u2019ll miss out on a lot of free gold. Expect the enemy to overwhelm you in the bottom lane to try to shut you down. Make sure you keep the lane warded at all times to reduce the chances of this happening.\n\nTeam fighting can be difficult for Draven as he needs to pick up his Axe\u2019s g in the fights. If he drops them, he will miss out on damage. Dodging damage, kiting and picking up Axe\u2019s g can be quite challenging."}
{"text": "Against leblanc, Leblanc can start in unbridled trades as soon as she unlocks her Q and W. She can also proc Electrocute very easily with her combo Q W AA. Once Leblanc has reached level 6, her death pressure gets increased because her Ultimate R is very versatile. He also has a very short cooldown, so play respectfully. Leblanc is very strong in the middle of the game once she has a lot of APs and items. Make sure you group with your team so she can't blow someone up quickly."}
{"text": "As teemo, Kite around while taking camps to make sure you can take healthy clearings. Just reach level three quickly and then start to crash. Once you get your Ultimate t, start riding the river and neutral, objective pit entries with your traps. This will allow you to detect your enemies and allow you to fly neutral goals with ease."}
{"text": "Against urgot, Urgot is good in early play. Expects that he plays aggressive and tries to kill. Once Urgot is level 6, his death pressure and ability to trade increases again. His Ultimate R is an execution and getting hit by it will make it very difficult for you to get out of the trade in a fight. After he has finished The Black Cleaver, he will be able to go for more frequent trades and he will be harder to kill."}
{"text": "As jax, He is really weak against a single CC target. In a team fight, if he gets the CC.D chain, he will die before he can reach something meaningful. The enemy can always react to Jax's games. He sends someone from their team to prevent him from separating from the push. They can even kill his entire team and then go for crucial goals like the Baron. Low against champions who are tidy and can kit him out of his reach."}
{"text": "As darius, You always need to be above half the health once Darius has his Ultimate, otherwise Darius can easily kill you even while you are under the effects of your Ultimate. Never take longer trades against Darius, especially if he did not use his E to engage the fight. Once his Passive grants him additional damage, he will almost certainly turn the fight around quickly. If you try to run away, he will shoot you again with his E. Darius will kill the minions extremely quickly with his Q if he uses it in the minion, causing the wave to push in your turn. You want that, because it helps to prevent Darius from freezing by his turn and forcing you to use your Q to catch the minions."}
{"text": "As skarner, Try your best to equal their gank pressure early. Vi is a good early Jungler, so gank often.\n\nPlaying around your Ultimate is really important. Make sure you look to gank whenever your Ultimate is up.\n\nYou can secure objectives a lot easier than him. Make sure you try to take them whenever possible.\n\nInvade and fight the Skarner as often as possible. You\u2019re stronger in 1v1s, so try to abuse it."}
{"text": "As vex, You will want to focus on clearing the waves and preserving the mana during early play. Your Q has a wide range and the hitbox, so make sure you target both minions and the enemy simultaneously. Keep track of your passive timer as it is the difference between a win and a lost battle. If the enemy relies on you dive, W they will fear them and reposition them quickly. Unlocking your ultimate R will allow you to ride freely after pushing the wave in. See if you can catch the enemies in the side lane and blow them up."}
{"text": "As braum, Braum is strong whenever his Ultimate R is up. It has good pick potential and can help you get kills. Each use of his Ultimate R can result in a kill.\n\nBraum is really good against melee champions, assassins and hard engage champions as he can CC them as soon as they engage with his Q and Passive.\n\nHe is really good in team fights thanks to his E and r. This makes him a really good Support as he can offer his carries tons of peel and protection."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn can't fight a team easily. She'll try to flank her Ultimate R side and get into a carry. Ward your flanks to make it harder for her to engage for free. If Quinn can fight a team, she'll stay in a side track and try to split the thrust. You can either send someone who has TP to prevent her from taking side turns, or you can quickly engage in the enemy team and start a fight. Do not delay a team fight because it will give Quinn time to take a goal or turn to join her team. Quinn, the selection potential is high."}

This is applicable for early to mid-game fights only.\n\nTeams with lots of CC and disengage tools are really good against Zac. He struggles to get onto targets, use his Ultimate R and make use of his Q when the enemy has escapes/ or CC.\n"}
{"text": "As maokai, Once Maokai gets another point in his Ultimate R, he will use it frequently. If the enemy ignores him leaving the track, they won't have a good time to deal with Maokai's Ultimate R and W. Maokai is pretty good in team fighting because he can distinguish enemies and CC several enemies with his Ultimate R. His Passive doesn't let him die easily either, so he can play the role of a disruptor. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to do a lot of damage with the ability and allow him to use it frequently."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of mana problems in the early game, but once she gets Tear of the Goddess she will play a lot more aggressive.\n\nCassiopeia really shines in the late game. She scales better than most champs and she can build 6 items. If you get ahead early- try closing out the game as soon as possible.\n\nNot many champions are as strong as Cassiopeia is at level 2. Beware of the level 2 all-in with her Q and E spam."}

All it has to do is to get out of its laning phase without giving the enemy a huge lead. Its E gives it a lot of off-play potential if it is used correctly. Against unsuspected enemies, this skill can be really deadly, and can help it kill safely enough. Can flank the enemy team with a relative ease and can come out of sticky situations with its E. This can send the enemy team in full panic mode and can allow your team to follow with ease."}

{"text": "As thresh, As soon as Thresh arrives on the track, the race for level two follows. That's because the level two of Thresh is devastatingly strong and can immediately get him killed.

{"text": "As kennen, Once Kennen has two points in his Ultimate m, he will be able to inflict massive amounts of damage to the enemy team. He just needs to choose the perfect time to enter. Kennen is excellent in team fighting due to his Ultimate m. He can pair him with his Flash for a devastating combo on the enemy team, which will leave them defenceless. More items mean more damage for Kennen. This will allow him to resume the game, and his poke damage will increase significantly in the game."}
{"text": "As darius, Use Darius' early aggression to get a lead in the way. Obtaining meaningful health or killing lead on the enemy will increase your chances of winning the game. Always go for extended trades as often as you can on Darius. Thanks to your Passive, you will always go out ahead in most cases. Use your Level 6 power peak to get killed in the track and start at snowball. Your Ultimate e can be used as an execution, so it should help you get an advance."}

Prolonged team fights will see him winning effortlessly."}
{"text": "As teemo, It is vulnerable when its t is down, and can be engaged if its speed of movement k is reduced. Its ultimate t can easily be rid by the enemy by buying Control Wards.

This puts his team in a disadvantageous state and causes a lot of tension to accumulate within the team."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Xin Zhao will have two points in his Ultimate R at level 11. It will allow him to use the ability more often, which will make it easier for him to convert fighting to 1 v 1 as and when necessary. His first ability will be maximized at the time he reaches level 9. It is a crucial peak of power because he massively increases his damage production and duel ability. Xin is excellent in team fighting and collecting enemies because of his kit. His Ultimate R will allow him to distinguish enemies, allowing him to be immune to various maneuvers."}
{"text": "As rumble, Poke and harass the enemy as much as possible with your E to lower them. Play around your Ultimate cooldown and constantly try to make games with it. Avoid taking too much damage. Focus on harassing the enemy after they have used a ability to reduce their commercial potential with you."}

If it can go to them, you will always be able to take charges in the fights of the late game team. Suppose you are able to land a W on high priority target- go and try to remove them. You have to play around with your Ultimate R in the late game. Fighting while it is on cooldown could be the difference between winning a fight and losing. When you have 3 points in your Ultimate R, your support is very difficult to manage."}
{"text": "Against malzahar, Malzahar will be a real threat when it reaches level 6. You must look at your positioning and not walk too far forward just in case he uses his ultimate R to catch you out of position. Destroy Malzahars shield whenever possible.

{"text": "As karthus, If the enemy Jungler continues to invade him, he is not able to do much without the help of his team. His style of play revolves around power farming until he obtains his ultimate e. This means that he is not capable of gank or against gank early, unless it is a guaranteed murder for him. His ultimate e deals with the meagre amounts of damage during the early match that obliges him to use it only when the enemy is too low. This can be a disadvantage if he does not have his items or if it is put back in place early."}
{"text": "Against zilean, Zilean doesn\u2019t have much damage at level 1 but once he has access to both his Q and W at level 2, his kill pressure will increase.

Whenever he uses his Ultimate R, try to abuse the cooldown and play aggressive while it\u2019s down.\n\nOnce he has max cooldown reduction, Zilean\u2019s Ultimate t} will be on a very short cooldown. It will be harder to get picks during the mid and late game as he will save them with his Ultimate t."}
{"text": "As gangplank, His Passive allows him to go out on short trades that are quite advantageous to him. Due to the quality of the scales of Gangplank, his passive damage is really useful to keep his enemies away from him. His E can be set up with strange angles that can catch the out-of-guard enemy and cause a lot of damage. It's really good if Gangplank has access to the track brushes in order to hide his barrels E. With his Ultimate R, he can impact any part of the map immediately and can act as an enabling force for his leftists / Jungler to everything in their counterpart and get an advance."}
{"text": "As soraka, It can easily get rid of if it gets the crowd controlled. The incorrect use of its E can give windows to the enemy team to all-en-Soraka or its partner laner. Trying not to use it for the poke is the best bet of Soraka. Its healing can easily be reduced with the purchase of a Grievous Wounds item. It is also thwarted by enemies who have some form of dash that they can use to avoid its Q."}
{"text": "As seraphine, During the middle of the game, your goal will be to be clear and get the priority of the track. The middle lane would certainly be better for you, but don't forget to show up for the skirmishes. Use your ultimate R very carefully, as it can be the decisive factor when it comes to winning a fight. Use the ability of multiple CC targets and chain it with your E CC. Fighting around closed spaces will help you a lot because you can easily target several champions. Your ultimate R and E should be quite easy to land."}

Return to action when his Subjugate n has cooled. Trundle will be divided by pushing a lot in the last stages of the game, try to fight as a team when he is not able to be there. If you spot him isolated and away from his team, try to force a team to fight with his allies. As soon as Trundle engages in a team fight, try to lock him up with CC.

Fighting around bottlenecks can allow you to separate enemies from their teammates. Your e and e should allow you to block the enemy and shoot them down. Neutral goals need to be constantly secured by you. You are really good at doing so; so make sure you try to secure some of the other goals after a gank."}

Cassiopeia will seek to ambuish or assassinate targets that move across the river alone.

Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly.

Wukong wins a lot of automatic attack battles, so don't go for prolonged trades with him unless you can kill him. If Wukong left the track after level 6, tell your team as soon as it leaves. He could try to use his Ultimate n in another way also help his allies."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 16 is not so big that it strengthens its roaming potential and nothing else. No further damage is dealt with by it due to this point added in its Ultimate R. Most of its capabilities will be maximized during this phase of the game. It will allow it to do a lot of damage if it can carefully combine its capabilities."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Look for extended trades whenever possible. Gragas relies heavily on his ability to inflict damage, but if they are on the cooldown, he can really do nothing except self-attack. Go for prolonged trades when one of his abilities is down. Gragas can tease a engagement when his Body Slam E is standing. Try and stand behind or near the minions at any time. However, do not stand too close to them since the ability has an AOE and if you are close to them, you will be hit by his E. If Gragas uses his W, it is because he wants to do something like set up his Jungler or go for a job. Play safer for a short period of time when he uses his W."}
{"text": "As volibear, An additional point in his Ultimat R will boost his overall damage and let him use the ability frequently. It will help him massively during team fights.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level nine. This increases his damage massively, and his dueling potential will be pretty respectable now.\n\nHis ability to disrupt team fights and secure picks during this phase of the game is really high. All he needs to do is ensure that he has proper follow-up during all-ins.        "}
{"text": "As aphelios, After the first return of Aphelios, he would have recovered his first damaging element. He can look for more favorable exchanges with the enemy once he has bought his first element. When Aphelios has reached level 6, he gets his first peak of major level power. Unlocking his ultimate R offers him a lot of trading and killing pressure. After Aphelios has finished his Mythic article, it will be comfortable to win exchanges with the enemy. It is especially true if he gets his Mythic article before the ADC enemy."}
{"text": "As diana, Stack the magic resitance early. Poke down with q as often as possible. Keep the wave earlier so you can pick up the farm. Pre 6, be ready to sacrifice some cs for XP so that they are not tyrant and all of you."}
{"text": "As akali, At level 16, Akali will have 3 points in her Ultimate She will be able to dish out a lot of damage to anyone she comes into contact with. Your Ultimate will also be on a lower cooldown, which is very beneficial.\n\nAt this stage of the game, Akali would be near max build. Landing an E on a squishy enemy champion should result in an easy kill. This kill could result in either the Baron or a favourable forced 5v4 fight.\n\nAkali does fall off in the later parts of the game as teams start to group. Akali is at her strongest in split fights or picks rather than straight 5v5s. Also, the enemy should start buying defensive items, which will make it harder for her to take them down."}
{"text": "Against velkoz, Force team fights as soon as possible: preferably when his Ultimate R is on cooldown. Do not delay a team fight as it will allow him to poke your team down with his Q and W. \n\nAvoid team fighting or forcing objectives like the Baron or Dragon when Vel\u2019koz is alive and nearby. He has great poke thanks to his Q, W and R which will make it difficult for your team to secure the objective easily. \n\nAvoid fighting in chokepoints like inside the jungle as it will give Vel\u2019koz an easier time landing his E, doing damage with his W and melting your team with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against yone, In team fights, try to stay away from one another so it\u2019s harder for Yone to get a good Ultimate R off.\n\nAvoid fighting in areas around the map that are enclosed like in the jungle or around the Baron/ Dragon as it will allow Yone to get a good Ultimate R off.\n\nJust like the laning phase, avoid chasing Yone down if he runs away as he will just use his E to juke you. "}
{"text": "As drmundo, If you reach the late game as Dr Mundo, you should\u2019ve brought a ton of tank and defensive items. At this stage of the game, you will be very, very tanky and pretty much unkillable. Look for aggressive fights with your team to gain a victory.\n\nAt level 16, Mundo will put the third point in his Ultimate R. The regeneration he gets back from this power spike will be incredibly potent. Even if the enemy picks up healing reduction items, he will still gain a ton of health back.\n\nAs Dr Mundo is a tank, he will be good in the late parts of the game as he can stick to the enemy backline and force them to focus him rather than his carries. Due to this playstyle, he should be a significant threat in late game team fights."}
{"text": "Against gangplank, Gangplank will always be stronger if he has a Barrel E placed under him. Keep this in mind and try to fight him when there isn\u2019t one.\n \nAt level 6, ping that Gangplank has his Ultimate R. It\u2019s key that your team knows that he can use his Ultimate R to impact a fight. \n \nGangplank is rather weak in the early game and needs time to come online. Try and abuse his weak early game to get ahead."}
{"text": "Against skarner, Skarner will look to flank in team fights with his E. Ward the flanks to make it easier for you to escape him before he comes charging at you.\n\nAvoid fighting in the jungle, around objectives or near the Baron. You need to be spaced out so he cannot land his Ultimate on multiple champions at once.\n\nInvest in armor and magic penetration items. Skarner will be building tank items and you will be unable to kill him if you do not buy these items.\n"}
{"text": "Against yone, Yone is incredibly mobile in lane, but if he uses his E, you can abuse the cooldown (after he\u2019s returned) to play aggressive and poke him down. This will make it harder for him to survive a trade or trade back with you.\n\nAvoid chasing too far when Yone uses his E as he will always return to his original spot.\n\nWhen playing as a ranged champion, try to use your range advantage to harass and poke him down. Try and stay far back though so he is unable to get onto you very easily."}
{"text": "As nautilus, They will not be able to all-in the enemy at all if their ADC is constantly pushing the wave in the early game.\n\nCan easily be poked down by ranged champions in the lane. Watching your positioning is key when playing as this champ.\n\nHas to commit to all-ins. If you go in, you\u2019ll be in an overextended position which could allow the enemy to turn the exchange around and kill you. Only go in when your allies are there to follow up."}
{"text": "As qiyana, She will be outstanding during the late game. This is because Qiyana can burst down enemies easily and take over team fights with her Ultimate R. It may also let her steal crucial objectives.\n\nLevel 16 is perfect for Qiyana as her Ultimate R will be maxed out. She will be dishing out way too much damage for the enemy squishies to handle, and that too very frequently.\n\nShe will have most of her abilities maxed during this phase of the game. This means that her damage output will be massive, and her abilities will be up sooner. It should be easy for her to take over the game now."}
{"text": "Against taric, Taric could start ganking as soon as he hits level 3. He will also be quite strong at the scuttle crab fight.\n\nTaric\u2019s going to be very strong in team fights as his Ultimate R can be used to protect his allies. Disengage or finish the targets off quickly as his Ultimate R comes down.\n\nHis healing and shielding will be obnoxious in team fights. Get some form of healing reduction to make him less powerful."}
{"text": "As varus, Varus Q poke during the laning phase is quite strong. If he targets his Q on the minion wave and the enemy at the same time, he will make great use of his mana. At level 6, Varus can configure his Jungler with his Ultimate R. A good Varus will seek to bring down the enemy and then get their Jungler of gank to close the enemy Mid laner. Varus' first element will give him a huge peak of power. This simply means that his combo of brilliant damage will do a lot of damage and can completely destroy any immobile enemy champion or CC."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Ziggs will try to delay a team fight for as long as possible while he pokes with his Q. Try to force a fight so he is unable to poke you down and force you to disengage.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult for you to siege objectives like Towers when Zigg\u2019s is alive. Try to catch him out of position or flank him when he\u2019s alone to make taking these objectives easier.\n\nKeep track of jungle camp timers and steal away his blue buff as it spawns. This will reduce his effectiveness in team fights and make it harder for him to poke you down before a team fight occurs."}
{"text": "As sona, Just focus on getting rid of the enemy with your Q and don't overextend. The goal is to increase and reach the late match. Use your W very discreetly because the ability of you costs a lot of mana. In addition, use it to save you from broken combos. Unlocking your Ultimate R will give you a massive incentive during team fights. Make sure you position yourself well and show yourself to team fights."}
{"text": "As jax, After the laning phase has ended, go to a different lane (or stay top) and just split push. You\u2019re a good split pusher and can draw a lot of attention to your lane.\n\nIf somebody tries to contest your split push, look to fight them. Jax is a good duelist and will be able to fight most enemies who try to stop him.\n\nWhile you\u2019re a champion that is usually sent to split push, you might need to group with your team if the enemy is trying to force something. Be prepared to rotate around the map and help them fight."}
{"text": "As chogath, At level 9, Cho\u2019Gath will max out his s. This is a good power spike for him as it will allow him to trade more effectively with the enemy laner.\n\nWhen he puts 2 points in his Ultimate t at level 11, his kill pressure intensifies dramatically as his Ultimate t will allow him to execute an enemy from higher health.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Cho\u2019gath should\u2019ve used his Ultimate t on minions or enemy champions. He will be stronger and stronger the more things he consumes."}
{"text": "As elise, Focus on securing objectives. Elise can do them alone or with her team. Secure every Dragon if possible.\n\nLook for picks with your E. Elise is really good at picking champions off and catching them out of position with this ability. If you can catch someone out, call for a nearby objective.\n\nContinue to pick up farm and secure your jungle camps. Getting gold in your pockets will make you a higher threat in the mid game."}
{"text": "As velkoz, If your allies move on your track after destroying their turn, rotate and move around the map to continue growing and winning XP and gold. Use your capabilities to quickly clear the minion waves so your team can besiege/prevent an enemy team seat. If you can land poke while also pushing the minion wave, you can look for a favorable trade. By sitting Baron or Dragon, or whenever you push the enemy under their turn, look for a peak with your abilities. If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you will be able to take the goal for free."}
{"text": "As jayce, He is mechanically a very difficult champion. You\u2019ll need a lot of games to master this champion.\n\nHe will run out of mana quickly, so you need to always keep an eye on your mana bar.\n\nIf you\u2019re behind, you\u2019re going to deal no damage in team fights and your poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "As aphelios, You should get at least one defensive item depending on the enemy team comp and fed carry as you will be a prime target. Always keep an eye out on your flanks and prioritize saving yourself.\n\nDon't get caught out trying to farm a side lane at this point. Neutral objectives are important at this point so always try to stay near the lane where the objective is about to spawn in the next few minutes.\n\nIf you manage to find a pick on someone, don't hesitate to use your Ultimate R to finish them off. Your Ultimate R cooldown should be quite low at this point but do your best to save some Infernum rounds for a major fight."}
{"text": "As sett, His ultimate R allows him both to get tanks from his carts and to inflict a lot of damage on the enemy team if he manages to ulterate his target on them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant. His passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so that he can resort to short tracks against enemy champions unlike other tanks. His W makes such high misleading damage, while providing him with mitigation of damage."}
{"text": "As twitch, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As kled, Once he gets two points in his Ultimate R, Kled can focus on running enemies down and completely destroying them with his team. He can even score singular picks with it.\n\nAt level 9, his first ability will be maxed out. This will give him a massive damage boost, and he will kill people in an instant. It will be quite the power spike for him.\n\nKled will have multiple items in the mid-game, which will make him a devastating force to deal with. This is really helpful for his team, and Kled will quickly act as the frontline for his team.        "}
{"text": "As lux, Really good potential for bursting with all its g, l, Ultimate n combo. This can remove an enemy squishy with ease from level six itself. Its shield e is misleadingly strong as it can allow it to save all members of its team from a lot of poke. This is also applicable when it is Support. Its g can be used to secure peaks inside the enemy Jungle or blind areas. This can be extremely beneficial if the chosen target is found to be the enemy Jungler or the varied port."}
{"text": "Against kalista, Extended trades will always favour Kalista thanks to her r. Try and avoid going for extending trades with her.\n\nKalista\u2019s first power spike is when she picks up her Berserker's Greaves as it will give her the first bit of attack speed she needs to snowball. \n\nOnce Kalista has completed Runaan\u2019s Hurricane, she will pump out a lot more damage and apply Rend r stacks really quickly."}
{"text": "As viego, Level six is a massive power spike as Viego will be able to unlock a powerful finishing ability. It can help a lot in clutch situations where Viego needs to execute his target quickly.\n\nHis early kill pressure is really high since all he needs to do is land his W and then follow it up with his Q and auto-attacks. This combo becomes way more devastating once Viego gets his Ultimate R.\n\nHis first item component will give him a massive boost in solo laning. He will be able to look for all-ins frequently and can completely decimate any immobile mid-laner.        "}
{"text": "As annie, She should focus on securing the peaks during this stage of the game with a fully stacked Passive and Q. The setting up of several death brushes is her key to success during this phase of the game. In the middle of the game, she is powerful whenever her Ultimate R is in place. Roaming to over-extension of the enemy tracks with her Jungler and the glove of the pushed enemy tracks should give her a massive lead. At this stage, Annie will have her basics. This simply means that every squishy target on the map should be afraid of Annie and her ability to un-shot if they are facing a random brush."}
{"text": "As malzahar, He is frail early on as his presence is negligible, and his abilities are telegraphed. All he needs to do is conserve his health and utilize his Passive till he gets to level six.\n\nOnce he hits level six, his presence will skyrocket, becoming a significant threat for the enemy laner. Working with the allied Jungler will help him massively.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities quite frequently. It will also let him deal more damage, especially once he gets his Ultimate R.        "}
{"text": "As leblanc, Limit trading with them earlier as they\u2019re strong in extended trades.\n\nAt level 6 they\u2019re much stronger than you, so be careful about fighting 1v1 post 6.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early on to protect you from their strong all-in.\n\nThey\u2019re a very good roaming champion. Ping if they leave lane. Don\u2019t match their roam, just push and get tower plates."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Extremely squishy and can be killed if some form of crowd control lands on her. This is especially true during the early game.\n\nHer Ultimate R has the probability of getting her entire team killed if used improperly. She is also very vulnerable when her C is down.\n\nThe worked ground mechanic on her Q can easily allow her laners to play in the middle of the lane as she can keep barraging her enemies with continuous Qs."}
{"text": "As milio, You have strong poke in the early game with your auto-attacks and your Q. Keep harassing the enemy from the get-go.\n\nAt level 3, you\u2019ll have access to all your basic abilities. This is one of your first major powerspikes in the early game.\n\nYour level 6 power spike is pretty major because it can help you and your ADC stay safe in lane.\n"}
{"text": "As karma, Karma's poke is really obnoxious for the enemy team during the mid-game. She also provides a lot of utility due to her d and d. This simply means that a good Karma will make her team invincible.\n\nAt level nine, Karma will have her Q maxed out. This increases her overall poke damage and will let her chunk out enemies before significant fights.\n\nLevel eleven will be a decent power spike due to her ability empowerment potential. This will come in really handy during significant fights in the objective pits."}
{"text": "Against irelia, Try and lock Irelia down at the start of the fight. This will make it much harder for her to jump around your team and get resets on her Q. \n\nAvoid fighting too close together as it will allow Irelia to use her Ultimate R on multiple people and allow her Q to reset. Stand together but not super close together.\n\nTry and fight after Irelia uses her E as it is one of her best tools to start a fight. Ideally, try and also fight around her Ultimate R as it will reduce her chances of getting resets."}
{"text": "As sett, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As nautilus, By getting 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will use the ability quite often. Team fights will be a breeze for him from now on. His ability to make team fights unfair due to his selection potential will be quite obvious during this game phase. He only has Ultimate and his enemy out of sight. His tankness will not know any limits during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "As shen, Try to use your E > Flash combination to make sure you can CC multiple targets during a fight. It will help your carriers focus on the mobile ports of the enemy team. Your E is really effective around the bottlenecks, so make sure to try CC multiple enemies with it sometimes. This should be very useful if you can use the war fog with it. Choose a high priority target that you want to protect during this phase of the game. Make sure they survive anything so that you can easily win team fights and get a lead."}
{"text": "As sylas, His first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give him a massive damage boost and allow him to blow up single targets with ease.\n\nSylas is quite decent in a team fight, especially if he gets an AoE-based ultimate from the enemy team. His life steal will prevent him from dying quickly.\n\nMultiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take enemy ultimates quickly. They will increase their effectiveness as a whole. It can be highly beneficial in team fights.        "}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Tahm Kench can absorb a lot of incoming damage in the track and in team fighting with his E. If it activates it at the right time, it can basically have two health bars and be almost impossible to kill. Its Ultimate r is very versatile. It can be used to save an ally, or catch someone out of position. It is an excellent tool especially in the middle and the end of the game team fights His W is very versatile. It can be used to escape the skirmishes, get over the walls, look for parts and many other things."}
{"text": "As warwick, Warwick will put the third point in his Ultimate R. It will be on a low cooldown and will be a great tool at picking off the enemy in the late parts of the game.\n\nWarwick will be very tanky in the late game so he will be able to soak up a lot of enemy damage.\n\nAt level 14, he would\u2019ve maxed 2 abilities at this stage of the game. This is a significant power spike for Warwick."}
{"text": "As leona, Leona will now have two points in her Ultimate e. The ability will be on a very low cooldown now, and she can quickly look around for picks on the enemy team.\n\nHer r will be maxed out soon. This will give her a ton of protection when she decides to all-in someone. It will only bolster the strength and duration of Leona's all-in.\n\nOnce Leona gets her core items, she can protect both her team and herself at the same time. This means that she can peel for her carries quite easily.        "}
{"text": "As masteryi, His e et e allows him to drop the aggro tower and take reduced damage to the tower respectively. Is a monster of scale, and if he manages to get his articles and hit the middle of the game, he will be almost unstoppable. For a squishy champion, he can a-man the Baron if he is in front. His Ultimate r can completely move the tide of a fight if he is not controlled. This allows him to use his e frequently, which allows him to avoid CC. Combined with his Wuju Style, he inflicts a lot of damage."}
{"text": "Against kennen, As Kennen is a varied champion, when playing as a melee champion, don't let him shoot you down with his 1 or base attacks. Be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP. Kennen has a versatile building path. Keep an eye on where to build it and build items to counter accordingly."}
{"text": "Against nami, Investing in an Executor Call to reduce Nami's healing on herself and her allies. This article is priceless when the enemy has a lot of support. Taking Nami first before a team struggle happens will make it really difficult for her ADC to survive because they will not have any coat or protection. Avoid team fighting around the goals or inside the jungle like Nami=\"s Ultimate R is big enough and if you fight in tight areas, it is guaranteed to land several knock-ups."}
{"text": "As twitch, Twitch's early game is pretty strong as he can poke enemies down with his e while slowing them with his k. The lane brushes will help him a lot.\n\nLevel six is a colossal power spike as it allows Twitch to impact and disrupt fights massively.

{"text": "Against twitch, AP Support Twitch has similar power spikes as ADC Twitch. Keep this in mind, especially around level power spikes.\n\nOnce Twitch has completed Lich Bane, his damage output and burst damage increases dramatically. Watch out for cheesy plays with his s as he may look to kill you once you return to lane.\n\nAt level 6, Twitch will unlock his Ultimate c. It offers him a lot of additional kill pressure in lane."}
{"text": "As kennen, Focus on farming and scaling. Kennen needs time to come online and if you go for a bad trade or fall behind, you\u2019re going to struggle to be useful later on.\n\nIf your bot lane rotates to the top side after getting the first tower, rotate to the bottom lane and start to farm there instead.\n\nUse your range and energy advantage to gain an early lead. Try to harass the enemy champion as often as possible."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Your Jungler would be very happy if you had to help him invade or take the Rift Herald once you pushed your wave into it. Your ability to secure choices is really high during this phase of the game. Make sure you keep an eye on the side tracks that you can easily find isolated enemies in these tracks, and catch them becomes really easy. During team fighting, make sure you can use your h regularly and on several enemies. This will allow you to do a ton of damage, and you will be able to survive for a while."}
{"text": "Against lissandra, Lissandra is very good at level 6 while her Ultimate R increases her death pressure. She can also easily install her Jungler with her Ultimate R. Lissandra reaches her real potential when the team fights as its Ultimate R and W are both AOE. Her Passive can also wreak havoc in a team fight. Once Lissandra has finished her first element, her clear wave will be very strong."}
{"text": "As rengar, He is the public enemy number one for any squishy carry in the game. He can practically one-shot them with one or two items and can tilt someone hard enough to win the game easily.\n\nHe can use his Passive with his Q to kill unsuspecting enemy Junglers and carries in their Jungle. He can also lane gank with his Ultimate R and Passive.\n\nHis dueling power early on is really strong, especially if he is top lane and has access to the lane brushes. He can initiate a snowball this way, which can easily allow him to win games."}
{"text": "As neeko, Her Q allows her team to play around her and her Jungler to spoil her. Her passive combined with her Ultimate R can be a deadly combo. If she passes after JC, she can run any enemy if they don't have some form of CC capability on them."}
{"text": "As lux, Lux will not have a lot of articles and will do a lot of harm due to its AP ratios. Any squishy who gets caught by his g will certainly end up dying. She will climb really hard to level 11. It is mainly because of her upgrade Ultimate n, which will increase the damage of this ability while drastically reducing its cooling. The mid-lane brushes will be a good place to wait for unsuspecting enemies. Lux is usually good during team fighting, but she will excel in fighting in the bottlenecks. The enemy will not be able to do anything to avoid the g of Lux and will be zoned by her poke l."}
{"text": "As shen, Capable of mitigating any form of self-attack damage with his W. This can cause enemy physical damage to be practically useless when this ability is active. He can really put good cheese brushes as well as full opportunities with his E. When combined with some articles, Shen can put extra debuffs on the teased champions with ease. His ultimate R can allow him to act as a goalkeeper for his teammates. This becomes really beneficial if one of Shen=s' teammates is fed and needs to be peeled for."}
{"text": "Against akali, Once Akali has completed her first item, her kill pressure increases and so does her damage output. Respect her all-in pressure once she completes it.\n \nAkali is capable of all-inning squishy champions at level 6 as she gets tons of mobility and damage thanks to her Ultimate. If she hasn't been playing aggressive before level 6, expect her to do so once she gets the level up.\n \nTry not to give Akali kills in the early game. She is a snowball heavy champion and once she has some gold under her belt, she can easily take over the map."}

{"text": "As zyra, Once you have a few levels behind you, you will be able to constantly harass the enemy with your Q and E. Winning an early health advance could set up your Jungler or could allow you to get an early murder. Once Zyra has improved its Boots, its mobility and the release of damage will increase. Zyra should get Boots and upgrade them as quickly as possible to increase its release from damage. At level 6, Zyra is the release of damage and kill the pressure to intensify even more. Play around your ultimate R to look for aggressive games with your ADC. Your ultimate R will provide a considerable amount of damage, so you should be able to get killed with it easily."}
{"text": "As illaoi, Illaoi will often push quickly with her Q. Standing outside the minion wave whenever possible, so she is unable to push the wave and push you at the same time. Making her choice between pushing and poking will help you in this way. Unless you can avoid all her Tents, the difference between killing or dying in Illaoi is the healing of her Tents, so try to buy a form of serious injury as soon as possible. Without her Tents, Illaoi the power of duel decreases fairly. Be proactive by destroying them when possible.

Use your Q for poke or firm when you know that her Q is on cooldown or if it is out of reach."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, In team fights, do not group closely together to make it impossible for her to land a 5 person Ultimate R. Be prepared to turn around if she looks like she\u2019s about to cast her Ultimate R.\n\nNever fight the enemy in the jungle or around an objective as her Ultimate R is really good in tight areas when teams are clumped together. Fight spaced out in a lane when possible. \n\nCassiopeia will look to ambush or assassinate targets that are moving through the river alone. Unless you know where Cassiopeia is, do not walk through the river or around the map on your own especially if you\u2019re squishy.

As long as you dodge his Q, you will win the 1v1s.\n\nMake sure you prioritize those objectives! You can take them easily, and if you don't take them before him, he will take them with his R easily.\n\nLook to gank whenever your Ultimate is up as you're Ultimate is a great tool for ganking, and you need to abuse its cooldown to get kills."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Look for extended trades whenever possible. Gragas relies heavily on his abilities to deal damage, but if they\u2019re on cooldown he cannot really do anything except for auto-attack. Go for extended trades when one of his abilities are down.\n \nGragas can tease an engage when his Body Slam E is up. Try and stand behind or near minions at all times. However, do not stand too close to them since the ability does have an AOE and if you\u2019re close to them, you\u2019ll be hit by his E.\n \nIf Gragas uses his W, it\u2019s because he wants to do something such as setting up his Jungler or going for a trade. Play safer for a short period of time whenever he uses his W."}

The fog of the war will help you a lot during this phase of the game. Prepare some brushes with your young E and all-in-the-enemy as soon as they come nearby. You will be very powerful during this game phase, and your tankness will be really high. Just make sure you don't leave your backline without protection, otherwise you will have a hard time to win the game."}
{"text": "As fiora, As her first game is the weakest point, building such an element can be pivotal to shut her down. The wrong use of her W can cost her the way. Once this ability is lowered, it can be CC=d to forget and get rid of it quite easily. This is especially true if she plunges into the enemy team. Her ultimate R can be easily avoided if the enemy team disengages as soon as she places her final R on a member of her team. During the laning phase, the opponent of Fiora=s can prevent her from proceeding her passive by using the terrain to block the direction in which the Vital appears."}

Avoid fighting him if you come into contact with him when he is fully stacked."}
{"text": "As zyra, In the middle of the game, the teams will begin to regroup. Thanks to Zyra's AOE capabilities, it will be pretty good during this stage in the game as it will be able to inflict damage on several enemy champions at once. Zyra would also have completed several elements when the mid-game roles around it. As a result, your abilities will inflict much more damage on you that will allow you to choose scathed targets. At level 9, Zyra would have maximized his Q or E. No matter which one you maximized first, you should be able to inflict a lot of damage to the enemy lantern during the mid-game or later parts of the laning phase."}
{"text": "As sona, She is a god during this phase of the game when it comes to team fighting. She will have to be careful about being chosen, however.

As long as she is alive, her allies won't die so easily."}
{"text": "As talon, Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to burst a single enemy with ease. It will also allow him to escape unpleasant situations. Talon will fall during the later parts of the game because the enemy will build defensive elements and be grouped. He will have to choose his moments and targets carefully. He will have many elements during this phase of the game. He will allow him to do a lot of damage if he manages to reach a target. Getting a defensive element will also strengthen his survival."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Your goal is to match its thrust power with your W. Stand outside the minion wave at all times so it can't push and poke you at the same time. This will be important if you want to survive the laning phase. Avoid using your Q too often in this matchup unless it's away from the minion wave. It costs a lot of mana and you need the mana for your W! One option you can take is to put early points in your E for the extra shield force."}

Focus on the kiting and automatic attack of the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so that you are not taken out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. It will not be able to use its E much if it is pushed up. Post 6, beware of its strong and all-in-potential burst with its Ultimate R. Try and stay away from it if you are low. Its Q is blocked by the minions and its W. Always stay inside or around the minion wave to make it difficult for her to harass you."}

Trying not to use it for poke is Soraka\u2019s best bet.\n\nHer healing can easily be reduced with the purchase of a Grievous Wounds item. She is also countered by enemies who have some form of dash which they can use to dodge her Q."}
{"text": "As taric, Taric is a utilitarian champion who empowers his allies. If his team is behind it, it will be difficult for him to do a lot in the fight. His E is very telegraphed and can be easily avoided if the enemy sees you using it. This makes it difficult for Taric to be an initiator in team fighting without committing his Flash."}
{"text": "As talon, At the end of the game, look for choices on immobile or poorly positioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In team fights, focus on the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get up on the enemy backline quickly.

His W makes such high misleading damage, while providing him with mitigation of damage."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Malphite is weak in early play. You can use it to your advantage by invading it early and trying to kill it. As Malphite can't really gank up to level 6, it will be looking for the power farm to get its Ultimate h as quickly as possible. You can delay its level 6 peak of power by invading its jungle and flying its camps. Malphite will not be spoiled until it has its Ultimate h. With this in mind, try to be as aggressive as you can and gank your allies as much as possible so that it is harder for Malphite to find waste opportunities with his allies behind."}

{"text": "Against ekko, Once Ekko hits level 6, his ganking will be more effective as he can go for deadlier and longer ganks thanks to his Ultimate R. If you see that your allies are low and he\u2019s on that side of the map, communicate with your team and tell them to recall so they don\u2019t die.\n\nEkko can start ganking once he has access to all 3 of his abilities. He cannot really gank too much unless he has all of his abilities available to him. \n\nWhen Ekko gets his jungling item completed, his trading power intensifies and he can 1v1 most Junglers if he is healthy."}
{"text": "As galio, Galio is a melee champion and can be easily abused by ranged Supports and the enemy ADC. This makes it hard for him to lane against poke champions. \n\nFurthermore, he can easily get interrupted by the enemy if he wants to engage with his E.

This is quite beneficial for him, given the AoE aspect of his Ultimate R.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9.

At this stage, duelling him is not going to favour you unless you have an advantage."}
{"text": "As chogath, The longer the game is, the more stacked it will be. This makes it strong enough in the last game. When it reaches level 16, Cho=Gath will put the third and final point in its Ultimate t. It will be able to bite easily and execute enemies that are taken out of position by its team. According to its construction path, Cho=Gath will either do a lot of damage in late game fights or be incredibly tanky."}
{"text": "As syndra, Very still and can collapse easily with multi-layer CC. Once CC-d, she will probably die with appropriate follow-up. Without her E, she is quite vulnerable and a sensitive gank target. This is especially true when the enemy has a varied form of CC. Positioning is absolutely necessary for this champion otherwise she can easily be caught and killed due to the motionless way and bursting that is related to her."}
{"text": "As poppy, Very strong all-in potential with her E. This when combined with her Q slow, can allow her to lock down an enemy for quite some time.\n\nHer W is the bane of any champion with dashes, especially all the carries who are reliant on their dashes.\n\nHer Ultimate R can allow her to turn the tide of a fight almost immediately as it can turn a 5 v 5 into a 5 v 2 easily.

{"text": "As akshan, You can use your E more liberally to get murders from now on. Your Ultimate will be on a short cooling time, to make sure you use it quite frequently. It will certainly help you cut off enemies who have already taken damage. If you have allies who have CC integrated into their kit, try to stay close to them. You should always focus on target CC'd and kill them when you get a chance. Also, if the enemy has a murderer, try to shade them and see if you can get the murder on them if they assassinate your allies."}
{"text": "Against kennen, At level 6, Kennen will have access to his Ultimate m which is an excellent tool for him because it increases his death pressure and ability to trade with you.

{"text": "As tryndamere, Its level eleven is not too good because it does not give it much statistics. The Ultimate e in itself will be convenient, however, and Trendamere can use track brushes to catch the enemy by surprise. Trendamere is really good at the split thrust due to its kit.

This means more effort than you put in him, the better you will be on him."}
{"text": "As gangplank, His Passive allows him to go out on short trades that are quite advantageous to him. Due to the quality of the scales of Gangplank, his passive damage is really useful to keep his enemies away from him. His E can be set up with strange angles that can catch the out-of-guard enemy and cause a lot of damage. It's really good if Gangplank has access to the track brushes in order to hide his barrels E. With his Ultimate R, he can impact any part of the map immediately and can act as an enabling force for his leftists / Jungler to everything in their counterpart and get an advance."}
{"text": "Against trundle, Once Trundle hits level 3 he can start to gank as his e is the main tool he needs to get ganks off. \n\nIf you are a tank, Trundles level 6 all-in can be deadly as it reduces your defensive stats to a crisp. When trading, be careful around the level 6 mark as he may look for an all-in.\n\nDepending on what build path the Trundle has gone for, he will peak at different times. Keep this in mind and always look to see what item\u2019s he has purchased and play accordingly."}

She will just need to maintain proper positioning and use her W properly.\n\nShe will have multiple items during this phase of the game. It will allow her to dish out tons of damage. Prolonged team fights will see her winning effortlessly."}
{"text": "As ryze, Ryze is excellent during the late game as he can completely take over the game with his overall burst damage combo and his Passive.

He can quickly jump from one objective to another, which can easily lead to wins for him.\n\nHis damage output will be really high during the later parts of the game. This will kill most of his enemies if they happen to get CC'd by Ryze."}
{"text": "As azir, As in the middle of the game, Azir does not point to level 16 either. While an additional point in his Ultimate R will come in practice, he will not do it or break it.

He should keep track of the items' cooldowns so that he can strike at the proper time.\n\nMost of his abilities will be maxed out during this phase of the game. This means a lot of damage from his end and him being extremely slippery during fights. CC will be his worst enemy during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 6 is a small peak because it allows it to wander but does not provide it with anything else.

It is really versatile and can also block the enemy off from entering a certain part of the map.\n\nWith your Ultimate m, Anivia\u2019s sieging power is incredibly strong. With lots of mana, you can constantly push the enemy into the enemies Tower and force them to stay in the lane."}
{"text": "As kaisa, At level nine, her Q will be completely maxed out and deal a lot of damage to her enemies. This will let her take over the game with ease.\n\nDepending on which build she is going for, she will be getting her first ability upgrade during this stage of the game. This will be a massive power spike and will let her be the prime carry for her team.\n\nKai'sa is really good in fights due to her E and Q. She can peel for herself and use her Ultimate R for both aggressive and defensive purposes."}
{"text": "As renekton, This champion is an early game bully. Play aggressive throughout the laning phase to get kills. If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate t is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate t is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}

In team fighting, Miss Fortune really shines that her Ultimate e can inflict tons of damage if she uses it in a safe place. Disengagement as soon as she channels her Ultimate e. At level 9, Miss Fortunes will do tons of damage if she hits you."}
{"text": "As lucian, Get level 2 first and look for a favourable trade with the enemy. Gaining an early health advantage will help you out.\n\nFocus on farming and looking for aggressive plays once the enemy uses an ability. Play around their abilities and look to abuse their cooldowns with your early game damage.\n\nRotate around the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP."}
{"text": "As graves, His e is very versatile. He can use it to reposition and close the gap between him and the enemy laner.\n\nAt level 6, his Ultimate t is very strong and can allow him to execute enemies who are on low health. If he is facing a weak laner, don\u2019t be afraid to go for the kill.\n\nThe e near-sightedness can cause mayhem for an enemy team, especially if they are clumped up together. This ability can prevent the enemy ADC from picking a target to focus on while Graves keeps pelting them with his auto-attacks."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Once Aatrox hits level 9, his Q will be maxed. The reduced cooldown and additional haste will mean this ability is on a very short cooldown.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Aatrox will have brought items that will reduce his abilities cooldown. Through levels 9-13, his abilities will be on a very short cooldown.\n\nWhen Aatrox hits level 11 and puts two points in his Ultimate, he will be a severe threat to the enemy in team fights. Fight around your Ultimate to deal a ton of damage and survive the team fight."}
{"text": "As malzahar, A fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow Malzahar to dish out hefty amounts of damage. Enchanters and squishy targets will have a hard time.\n\nHe is solid during late-game fights as his Q and Ultimate R will hit like a truck now. He will need to check the enemy inventory for a QSS before he decides to all-in a champion, though.\n\nHis Q and E will be maxed out and will be doing many consistent DPS during this phase of the game. The Q will let him keep the wave in check as well."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Can initiate tower dives early on and try to get kills once his laner pushes the wave in. His e and e allows him to drop tower aggro and take reduced tower damage respectively.\n\nIs a scaling monster, and if he manages to get his items and hit the mid-to-late game, he will be almost unstoppable. For a squishy champion, he can one-man the Baron if he is ahead.\n\nHis Ultimate r can completely shift the tide of a fight if he is left unchecked. This allows him to use his e frequently, which allows him to avoid CC. Combined with his Wuju Style, he deals a lot of damage."}

This makes it really good for Twitch as he can use his Ultimate c effectively.\n\nLevel 11 is a power spike as he will get two points in his Ultimate c. He will also have multiple items, which means that he should be able to dish out a lot of damage with ease.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9, which means that he will deal a lot of damage now. Combined with his Passive, it should play a pivotal role in destroying the enemy team.        "}
{"text": "As hecarim, You will want to go for extended trades against your laner to make sure that your rune can proceed and you can cure some of the damages that have been inflicted on you. Do this regularly to win the game. Your W and p will be instrumental for your success. Use your track brushes carefully and try to catch the out-of-guard enemies. All'in'ing should be really easy once they have pushed up the wave. Unlocking your Ultimate t will give a massive boost to your global duel potential. This will also allow you to prevent enemies from escaping with their Flash."}
{"text": "As graves, Focus on securing the remaining Dragons/ Rift Herald in the mid-game. Getting as many Drakes as possible will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nGraves is a strong skirmisher, so continue to play aggressive and look for 1v1 duels in the mid-game. Just make sure you don\u2019t die or get caught when Baron\u2019s about to spawn.\n\nGroup with your team and look to siege objectives/ look for picks as a team to open up the map."}
{"text": "As neeko, It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Don't just stay in the middle if you can't get anything done. Flank in the team fights to make it easier to access the enemy backline. Use your W to speed up to get off a good R Ultimate. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their timer of death to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more murders."}

It will play a pivotal role in finishing fights and killing unsuspecting enemies.\n\nJinx's Q will be maxed at level nine, increasing her damage output drastically and allowing her to take over the game with ease. She will just need good peel from her teammates.\n\nJinx will be really great during mid-game fights. This is primarily due to her Q and auto-attacks but will definitely do well if she has a high peel/enabling Support.        "}
{"text": "As volibear, During this phase of the game, make sure you get choices all around the map. Doing unfair team fighting should be your only goal. In team fighting, try to separate the enemy front line from the enemy rear line. This will allow your aircraft carriers to play freely, and you will be able to absorb a lot of damage for your allies. Use the fog of war and choking points to secure team fighting victories. Your chances of winning a fight will increase considerably as you have a lot of AoE effects in your abilities."}
{"text": "As vayne, Vayne needs a lot of time on the scale because of the nature of her kit. The more she goes into the game, the more her chances of bringing her team solo to victory. Level six is a massive start peak of the game because she can now look for aggressive all-ins on the enemy. It is effortless for Vayne of bamboozle the enemies now because of its invisibility. The first element will certainly give Vayne a massive boost in the duel. She will have to use the track brushes to make sure that she can compensate for her short range."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Do not push the way without having the bushes of the track in the lower lane. You never know, Fiddle could be hidden there and ready to vomit. Fiddlesticks is rather still and usually pushes the wave. Try to ask for ganks of your Jungler and then enter just before they arrive for the greatest chance of killing him. Try and lure his Q before committing himself fully to a commitment or else he will interrupt the exchange. One way to do it is to walk forward and falsely bait a commitment. Every time he uses his Q, abuse cooldown."}
{"text": "As galio, If he misses his E, the enemy team can quite literally walk up to him (not in melee range) and keep poking and harassing him for a long time.\n\nCan\u2019t do much if the enemy laner wards the river(if he is mid lane)/lane brushes(if he is supporting). As soon as the enemy sees Galio moving out of the lane, they will start playing safely and negate Galio\u2019s threat.\n\nGalio\u2019s effectiveness is greatly reduced if the enemy team positions and spaces correctly during a fight. He is decent against magic damage but AD ranged champions can tear through him, especially after he uses his E."}
{"text": "As leesin, At level 6, Lee Sin will unblock his Ultimate k. His total pressure and kill increases sharply at this stage of the game. The first element will allow him to get a boost and increased survival during all the in. He will give him more chances of being killed during a duel."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Heinously strong during the early game due to his Q and E. Can win almost any 1 v 1 during this period so he should be looking to contest objectives with his team.\n\nHis Ultimate R is very effective against ranged members of the enemy team. This will force the enemy carries to come in melee range of him, which can be quite devastating for them.\n\nSeriously good objective control during the early game so it shouldn\u2019t be hard for him to take early Dragons and Rift Heralds. He can also invade quite freely (after considering the lane priority of the side he is invading)."}
{"text": "As malphite, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive games. You enjoy extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}

He can all-in the enemy at level 3 when he gets access to all 3 basic abilities.\n\nAt level 6, Xin Zhao\u2019s kill pressure heavily increases. He can instantly kill any enemy laner and chase them down once he has his Ultimate R.\n\nAfter Xin has picked up his first component item, he can trade very aggressively with the enemy. Furthermore, the extra damage he gets from this item will help him last hit and farm easily.\n"}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan has tons of mobility thanks to his E. He can allow him to move in the way with ease, and go to the enemy to sound quickly. Akshan can bring back his dead allies if he can kill the enemy who killed them. It's great, especially in the last stages of the game where the time of death is long enough. His W allows him to get out of sticky situations and allow him to be camouflaged for a long period of time if he remains close to a wall."}
{"text": "Against garen, At level 6, Garen will have access to his Ultimate R which can be used to execute enemies. Do not fight him when weak, and certainly remember if you are below 50% of health as he could look for a trade. It is better to be sure rather than try to fight and give him a murder. Once Garen has finished his first article, he will be more heinous and seek to exchange more and more. Keep this in mind and do not commit to fight with him alone."}
{"text": "As renekton, You will have to be careful about his dash. It may give a false sense of security which can bait you into going for easy farm, while Renekton goes and all-ins you.\n\nBait his Ultimate out when possible. Doing so will allow you to easily win any fights he takes after his ult runs out.\n\nWait till Renekton has used his dash till you use your ult on him.

{"text": "As malzahar, Don't fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available as you're going to miss on the CC it provides. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or out of position. Peel for your rides to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "As sona, During the mid-game, you will want to group up as much as possible. This will help you deal with enemies who are tankier than you.

Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game. Getting them and securing the Dragon Soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nLook for picks with your team. If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Once Jarvan maxes his first ability at level 9, he will be able to deal quite a decent amount of damage. His all-in potential will also see a significant boost depending on which ability he decided to max first.\n\nGetting level 11 is another significant power spike for Jarvan IV, as his ability to all-in enemies reliably will increase a thousand folds. It will have a reduced cooldown and will deal a heavier amount of damage.\n\nHis ability to pick enemies off during this phase of the game is massive. He can try to invade the enemy's Jungle along with his Jungler and see if he can get some picks there. His all-in potential will be pretty potent during clumped fights as well."}

{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn can't fight a team easily. She'll try to flank her Ultimate R side and get into a carry. Ward your flanks to make it harder for her to engage for free. If Quinn can fight a team, she'll stay in a side track and try to split the thrust. You can either send someone who has TP to prevent her from taking side turns, or you can quickly engage in the enemy team and start a fight. Do not delay a team fight because it will give Quinn time to take a goal or turn to join her team. Quinn, the selection potential is high."}

If it\u2019s spawning soon, make sure you place vision around the objective as quickly and as safely as possible before retreating to safety. Having vision around major objectives is key.\n\nAs a Support, you\u2019re quite vulnerable and can easily be killed when going to ward, when you\u2019re moving around the map, and when you\u2019re alone. To reduce the chances of dying and getting caught out of position, try and stick with your team at all times."}
{"text": "Against urgot, In team fights, try to block the engage and R from Urgot for your low health teammates.

If you do it successfully your teammate will live on.\n\nBuy a Quicksilver Sash if you want to deny Fear Beyond Death R execution. The drill itself can\u2019t be removed, but you can QSS the second part just before execution."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo becomes really powerful once he hits level 16. This means that his Ultimate R will deal massive amounts of damage in a brief time. Moreso, the short cooldown will allow Yasuo to deal with tanks regularly.\n\nYasuo will have a bunch of completed items during this phase of the game. This means that Yasuo will decimate the enemy due to his Passive and r damage. He can pretty much one-shot squishies with ease.\n\nDue to all his completed items, and his ability to quickly dash around and pierce through the tanks' armors, Yasuo will be able to deal a plethora of damage in a short time. The enemy team might as well FF at this point if Yasuo manages to get ahead."}
{"text": "As irelia, Three points in her Ultimate R will give her a massive power spike. Then, with a short cooldown, she will take more fights and easily pick enemies in the side lanes.\n\nAt this point, due to her items, Irelia will be extremely tanky and will be dealing tons of damage. The amount of damage she deals will catch most enemies off-guard, especially if she manages to flank the enemy.\n\nIrelia is especially good in fights, specifically fights which occur around choke points. This is because her Ultimate R limits the enemy's movement and allows her teammate to dive on the enemy."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Ezreal is mobile, but not as mobile as you. Just use your E with discretion to get to him quickly. Avoid getting hit by his Q in this matchup. You can use your W to do it if you have no other way. After six, you should be able to all-in Ezreal regularly in this matchup. Just make sure his E is in advance. Keep the wave in the middle of the track or near your turret. Try to expose Ezreal to ganks in this way."}
{"text": "As syndra, Level 6 is a massive power peak for Syndra because it can easily shoot down enemies now. It also allows it to use its E correctly. The first element will give it a lot of apparent wave and damage. It will also give it a lot of mana to throw away its abilities frequently. Level 3 is a decent peak of power because it allows it to access all its primary capabilities. It also allows it to go to regular exchanges against its enemies."}
{"text": "Against xayah, When she uses it, try to force another fight after healing. Sometimes, Xayah will be left in the middle lane with her farm support. If you spot her team in the side lanes, force a fight with the advantage of numbers and then take the middle lane tower after. As Xayah is really good in kiteing, you might need to flank her in the team fights to make it harder for her to make kite and escape a fight."}
{"text": "Against ahri, When Ahri's Charm is down there, she doesn't have a real way to defend herself without blowing her Ultimate. Watch to fight her when her Charm is not available. Try and stay outside the minion wave, but close to him. This will force her to choose between pushing her Q or poking with her instead. Stand by the wave so you can run inside to avoid her E. Ahri is incredibly vulnerable when her Ultimate is down there. Make sure to abuse the long cooldown early."}
{"text": "As udyr, His ultimate R does not really give him any form of power peak. His overall game style remains the same, and he can be easily removed if he overextends. Very dependent on the mana, so if someone manages to steal his Blue Buff, he will have a really difficult time to spam his abilities and kill someone. If Udyr has his E on Cooldown, or if he used it with his Flash to stun someone, he will have no form of escape and can be killed if crowd control is superimposed on him."}
{"text": "As masteryi, When no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. You must continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. The more gold Master Yi has, the stronger he will be.\n\nIf your team gets a kill or two, make the call for Baron or the Dragon. You should be able to take them with ease as Master Yi.\n\nAlways use the fog of war to bamboozle the enemy and destroy the enemy backline that way. It should be really easy to do due to how much damage you can dish out."}
{"text": "As leblanc, Flank in team fights to get on key targets with your W. Avoid showing yourself when possible in the late game as the element of surprise can provide a huge advantage.\n\nWhen ahead, look for picks by waiting in high traffic areas for an enemy to walk by. If you\u2019re able to take down the enemy Mid, ADC or Support, you can use their death timer to end the game or take a major objective.\n\nGroup with your team in the late game. Do not split push or leave them alone when the enemy is grouped as 5. If your team gets engaged on, they will lose the fight."}
{"text": "As braum, At level 11, Braum will put a second point in his Ultimate r. Additional damage and reduced cooling are very beneficial to him during this stage of the game. At level 9, Braum maximizes his first ability. If he maximizes his Q first, he will be able to look for peaks more frequently thanks to the lower cooldown. The teams will start to regroup in the middle of the game. It's good for Braum because his Ultimate r is an AOE tool that can hit several champions."}
{"text": "As kayn, When it is against the range champions, or if the enemy freezes near their turn, it will be quite difficult for Kayn to be useful because they can zone it away from CS and XP. Kayn is high risk and high reward. If he does not get an early advance, he can fight to be useful in the later stages of the game. In the team fights, it could be difficult for him to kill anyone if they have CC, long-ranged poke, or disengage tools. He has the same problem as many assassins."}
{"text": "Against zed, As soon as Zed reaches level 3, his death pressure increases once he has access to his basic abilities. He can look for an all-in if he has been able to poke you down beforehand. Every time Zed reaches level 6 his death pressure increases once again and he will seek to go to kill every time he has his ultimate R available for him. Expects that he will play aggressive once he gets the higher level. Zed is pretty good in the middle of the game because he will have 2 articles and will be able to assassinate any squishy target he comes into contact with. Avoid walking in areas where you know that Zed is or has been in recently."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille may look for an all-in at level 3 or 4 once she has access to her core abilities. Try and not lose too much health prior to hitting level 3 otherwise it is guaranteed that she will look for the all-in.\n \nWhenever Camille has her E available, you need to be careful with your positioning as it will provide her with an opportunity to engage if you\u2019re stood by a wall. Stand in the middle of the lane as much as possible.\n \nAt level 6 Camille will gain access to her Ultimate R which can be deadly if you\u2019re low and overextended. Respect her all-in and do not push without vision as her Ultimate R can also be used to set up her Jungler."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Fortunately, he will not have this problem at the end of the game and will now remove many enemies with his E. Adding another point to his Ultimate R will give his powers more global strength. It can be practical by taking neutral goals and fighting enemies who rely on diving and lock Heimerdinger down. Heimerdinger will have a lot of articles now, and his abilities can easily a-shot enemies if they are not careful or if Heimerdinger puts a death brush somewhere. He can also take on the Baron alone."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, Miss Fortune is not very strong in the early game but she does have a lot of poke damage with her t. Watch your positioning and avoid standing behind minions when possible.\n\nPost 6, stand in the middle of the lane at all times to make it easier for you to get out of her Ultimate e when she channels it. If you stand near a wall, it will be harder for you to escape the damage.\n\nWhen paired with a hard engage Support, do not stand too far forward as the enemy Support may engage and set up the Miss Fortune for a good Ultimate e. If you have a dodge, don\u2019t use it when her Ultimate e is up."}
{"text": "As diana, In the late game, Diana should be near full build. Make sure you play around your active items and your Ultimate R to deal the most amount of damage in a team fight.\n\nTeams will be grouping in the late game, and as Diana\u2019s Ultimate R is an AOE tool, she will deal a lot of damage to enemies that are grouped closely together.\n\nAt level 16, Diana would\u2019ve put the third and final point in her Ultimate R. She will now deal a considerable amount of AOE damage to any enemies caught up in it."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Ensure there is always a minion between you and Pyke at all times to make it harder for him to land his Q.\n\nKeep an eye on his positioning at all times.

Ping whenever he leaves lane so your teammates know that he is missing."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius is one of the strongest early game champions in the game. You can use this advantage to gain an early lead.\n\nExtended trades work in the favour of Darius thanks to his Passive. He will win almost every auto-attack battle.

{"text": "Against jayce, Make sure you're still behind the minion wave so the minions block its damage. Do not stay directly behind them as its s is AOE. Once Jayce has an object under his belt, he will be able to push the minion wave incredibly quickly. Make sure to match its thrust power so that you don't lose the turn plates early. Jayce is not so good at roaming. If you play a roaming champion, make sure you're only going to wander when it's not in the way. Jayce will just push the wave and take your turn if you're looking to wander when it's in the way."}
{"text": "As masteryi, Your goal in the early game is to gain as much gold and XP as quickly as you can. Focus on farming rather than ganking or fighting.\n\nLook to secure objectives as often as possible.

Stand away from walls and his Pillar Q so he is unable to CC.\n\nRefrain from using any major CC abilities on Ornn when his W is off cooldown as he can use it to dodge or escape CC.\n\nOnce Ornn hits level 6, his kill pressure in lane will increase and he may start getting ganks from his Jungler. Get vision in the river so you can spot the Jungler early."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Don't regroup or fight in the jungle because this will allow Rumble to get a good Ultimate b off. By fighting out, it will be harder for him to get an Ult 5 people b. Never try to take a goal like Baron or Dragon if Rumble is alive and kick. As you will be close enough together inside the pit, you will allow him to land a devastating b on your entire team. Rumble is inclined to disengage. As soon as he uses his Ultimate b, try to disengage or reposition so it is harder for him to follow the damage and win the fight."}

This is because one misplaced Ultimate R from your end can lose you an entire team fight. His skill curve is massive and is quite hard to overcome.\n\nGetting caught out with your E on cooldown, especially during the early game will get you killed. Besides, if you keep roaming, chances are that your ADC will fall massively behind and will get killed frequently, especially if you are in a low elo bracket. "}

This makes it easy for him to act as a disruptor during team fights.\n\nHis e combined with his d can allow him to run down a single enemy target easily. The d shield allows him to mitigate a good amount of poke as well.\n\nHis Ultimate b makes him a menace during team fights. The enemy team can\u2019t afford to fight in closed spaces or they will definitely get chunked out by his Ultimate b."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Your Ultimate e makes you unqualified for a period of time. This makes it difficult to kill you who can give you time to kill the enemy.

He can easily use his pillar to block off the escape routes of the enemy.\n\nAt level 14, he will have his 2nd ability maxed out.

{"text": "As chogath, You are a Jungler stronger than Cho'Gath. Use your early play pressure to get an early lead. Don't be afraid to fight him alone. As long as you avoid his Q, you will win the 1v1s. Make sure you prioritize these goals! You can easily take them, and if you don't take them before him, he will take them with his R easily. Look at gank every time your Ultimate is up you are Ultimate is an excellent tool to glove, and you have to abuse his cooldown to get murders."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Once Quinn reaches level 6, her death pressure in a trade does not increase exactly as her Ultimate R is a tool of utility. However, her ability to wander does. If she leaves the track, ping your teammates so they know that she is missing. She has a lot of bursting damage early. Keep this in mind when launching against her and expects her to play aggressively and look back. When she returns to the track, Quinn can look for an aggressive whole. That's another thing to keep in mind. You can reduce her chances of going all-in by looking back at you when you go back to the track, or keeping the wave closer to your side of the track."}
{"text": "As jayce, He is mechanically a very difficult champion. You\u2019ll need a lot of games to master this champion.\n\nHe will run out of mana quickly, so you need to always keep an eye on your mana bar.\n\nIf you\u2019re behind, you\u2019re going to deal no damage in team fights and your poke/all-in will not be very good."}
{"text": "As taric, His E is very telegraphed and can be skipped without sweat. This makes it very difficult for him to be an initiator of fights without his Flash. His Q costs a lot of mana and will make him miss mana if he is against a poke comp. This will force him to abandon the priority of the track during the early match, which can sometimes mean an instant loss. He focuses on empowering people with his Q, W and Ultimate R. If everyone on his team does hurt, there is nothing he can really do to save the game."}
{"text": "As caitlyn, In the late stages of the game, make sure you stick with your team at all times. Do not get caught out alone as it may cost you the game. Stay safe and stay with your allies.\n\nDo not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and auto-attack the nearest enemy champion. Use your E to gain distance from the enemy frontline. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will focus you and take you down.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target."}
{"text": "As yone, After your bot lane has rotated to the mid lane, move to the side lane and start farming and gaining XP there. You can look to 1v1 any enemy who tries to stop you.\n\nLook for frequent trades with the enemy throughout the laning phase. Getting an early kill could snowball the lane heavily in your favour.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 6, look to play more aggressive. Your Ultimate R is a great skirmishing tool and you can get kills with it."}
{"text": "As volibear, It is countered by Grievous Wounds because it prevents him from healing by many, thus reducing his diving tower and all-in-potential. Dispersing in a team fight will prevent him from getting a massive final R, and changing the tide of a team fight. His trading power is weaker when his ultimate R is on the cooldown. His main goal is to get an early lead by constantly gaunting."}
{"text": "As warwick, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting without it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As poppy, Level 11 is relatively lackluster as she only gets the cooldown on the ability reduced. When compared to other Junglers, it doesn't bring a lot to the table.\n\nPoppy is extremely potent during this phase of the game as she can deal consistent damage and CC enemies for days. Her tankiness makes it impossible for the enemy team to kill her as well.\n\nLevel 9 is when her first ability will get maxed. This will let her deal a lot of damage to enemies she has managed to catch. It will also allow her to thwart escape attempts from the enemy.        "}

If she goes in too deep, she can easily be killed, which will translate to easy objectives for the enemy team.\n\nFalls off during the late game due to all the enemies building defenses. She is then left to either peel for her team or look for flanks in order to assassinate the enemy carry (probably at the expense of her own life)."}
{"text": "As jhin, Stay with your Support throughout the middle of the game. If you get away from them, you'll be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you're always close to at least 1 ally. Group and stay with your team at all times. Do not divide the thrust or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them. Look for choices with your Support/Jungler to get killed and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille has good outplay potential with her E and Ultimate R. She can often outplay the enemy and turn around or escape exchanges with ease.\n\nShe is a challenging champion that is quite fun and rewarding. Players who put a lot of effort into learning her will reap the rewards of a veteran Camille player.\n\nHer Ultimate R is a good tool that can result in a kill every time. If she is unable to kill the enemy laner, she can roam to another lane and use it there instead."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, Aurelion is a mana hungry champion. Keep a constant eye on your mana bar at any time otherwise you will have little threat of killing. It will also be vulnerable to ganks and all-in if it is weak. Make sure you have enough mana to use your W just in case something happens. Aurelion Sol is a very difficult champion to play. You will need to take a lot of time to master Aurelion Sol. As Aurelion Sol is a heavy wandering champion, it can be difficult for you to wander if your sideways are not strong."}
{"text": "As talon, If Talon falls behind it doesn't go to a single blow from the enemy. Make sure you get so much gold and XP in the early game to make your late game more impacting. If your allies don't have follow-up damage or CC, it will be difficult for you to help their roaming path. Once the enemy starts to group, you will find it harder to choose enemies and further your lead."}
{"text": "As akshan, Keep the wave closer to your side of the map in the very early game. It will protect you from ganks and from them zoning you away from farm.\n\nJust focus on farming early on and poking. Avoid trying to fight frequently early until you\u2019ve got some levels under your belt.\n\nKeep poking him down with your Q and W, but avoid pushing too much.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave to force Akshan to choose between pushing and poking you."}
{"text": "Against gwen, Look to fight it when it doesn't have a lot of Q batteries as its ability to trade with you will be reduced. Its damage output will be weaker when it doesn't have batteries. The good times to look for fighting are when it used its W. When it activates its W, it will win defensive statistics bonus. If you can bait or disengage when its W is active, you will find it easier to kill it when it is on the cooldown."}
{"text": "As akshan, Putting the third and final point in Akshans Ultimate at level 16 is really beneficial to him. In the late part, depending on his articles, he may be able to pay tons of damage to a squishy target. At level 13, Akshan goes max on his E. The extra mobility is very powerful in the later stages of the game. Once again, as the teams regroup in the late part, if he can get the closure on a marked enemy, he can bring back an ally to life that could turn the tide of the game."}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, It offers it an extra pressure to kill. Keep this in mind when the snail post 6. Tahm's early game is rather weak. Try and abuse it to get an early lead. The more the game goes, the stronger and tankier Tahm Kench will become. Put it behind in the early game to reduce its power in the late game."}
{"text": "Against elise, Elise relies heavily on her Cocoon landing to initiate fights or ganks. If you are nearby, you can counter gank her as she doesn't have much to offer once her E on cooldown. Elise has a lot of bursting damage and can kill most champions solo in the beginning of the game. If you don't play a tanky champion or one with a heavy CC, try not to fight her on one. Her ability Reminder allows her to fall on any enemy target, including minions and neighborhoods."}
{"text": "As teemo, He can roam around the map and place his Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow him to detect enemies as well as get kills on unsuspecting low health targets.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let him deal hefty amounts of burst damage and will let him kill his enemies quickly.\n\nHe isn't outstanding in team fights, so he should either resort to securing picks and blowing people up with his abilities or just split pushing till the enemy responds to him.        "}
{"text": "As sett, It can accumulate a lot of damage during this phase of the game because it will have all its articles, which will make it really strong. It will now be a front liner quite reliable for its team. A maximum-out Ultimate R will be on the rise frequently, and the following team fights will become a breeze during this part of the game. It is a decent team fighter during this phase of the game. It can regenerate its health quickly because of its passive and its real damage will melt through the enemy health bars."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Do not fight him when his e is up. Once it is down, look to all-in and kill him.\n\nYour mobility is your mainstay in this matchup. Use it to avoid Kog'Maw's damage, then retaliate against him and kill him.\n\nPicking him off during the late game should help you a lot in this matchup. Once he is down, his team won't have a lot of DPS left in them.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower and see if you can expose him to ganks. Shutting him down early is key to winning the game."}
{"text": "As jax, Level 6 is a massive peak for Jax. This is due to the increased resistance he gets when he activates his Ultimate t. This will help him a lot when it comes to using his Passive and attacking in a consistent way. Jax's first element will allow him to gain an advantage over the enemy. It will increase his global duel potential and completely dismantle the game plan of any enemy who is overstretched and has not put the vision around the map."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Yasuo is really strong once he has 100% chance of writing. Thanks to his passive, he can arrive at this stage quite quickly. Once Yasuo is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his pressure to kill increases. You should play respectfully whenever his Ultimate R is standing as he can quite easily kill you. Yasuo is really good in team fights if he is chosen in a team with several knock-ups."}
{"text": "Against corki, If you're short range, or if you have a Support who is melee, try and avoid letting him bully you down with basic attacks (and his abilities) or else you'll find it hard to pick up farm or engage. Abuse the bushes to help with vision so he cannot auto you for free.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave or behind it. This will result in him having to choose between pushing or poking you. Don\u2019t stand in the minion wave as he will be able to push and poke with his b or e.\n \nPost-level 6, Corki will look to constantly push the minion wave. Try to match his wave clear so he doesn\u2019t keep you pushed in. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll lose priority and tower plates."}
{"text": "Against viego, It is quite vulnerable to the CC and if you can kill it before it has its combo, the enemy will lose on a lot of damage. Keep track of who it can change at the beginning and during a fight. Try to play accordingly all its new potential abilities. Try and avoid fighting in the river or in the jungle, because Viegos E can make it very difficult to kill. It is better to fight at the opening or after using its E. Its E allows it to be super slippery."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, Fortunately, he will not have this problem at the end of the game and will now remove many enemies with his E. Adding another point to his Ultimate R will give his powers more global strength. It can be practical by taking neutral goals and fighting enemies who rely on diving and lock Heimerdinger down. Heimerdinger will have a lot of articles now, and his abilities can easily a-shot enemies if they are not careful or if Heimerdinger puts a death brush somewhere. He can also take on the Baron alone."}
{"text": "As urgot, Your goal in the early game is to take calculated trades while fighting the enemy. Use your range advantage where suitable to bully annd gain a lead.\n\nOnce you have quite a few levels under your belt, you should look for short favourable trades. You may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in lane."}
{"text": "Against olaf, Olaf is a dominant laner and can easily be killed at level 1 and 2 with its spam t. Avoid fighting it early. Once Olaf reaches level 6, it will be difficult for you to kill it or lock it with CC. Do not commit to using any hard CC capability when you know that its Ultimate k is in place. As soon as Olaf completes its first article, it will do tons of damage. Make sure you play respectfully and only trade with it if its t is down (or it is unable to pick up an Axe t)."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Keep poking the enemy with your Q and use the lane brushes to get a massive advantage on the enemy. Try to hit both the wave and the enemy at the same time.\n\nPoking out the enemy will be your top priority. Killing them doesn't matter but ensure that you don't let them respond to any fights happening in the river.\n\nNeutral objective fights will be easily won by you if you use your Q and W carefully. Ensure that the choke points are covered up and chunk the enemies out."}
{"text": "As soraka, Her early play is weak, and she will have to rely on landing her Q on her laner whenever possible. Playing safely is the best way to go and should allow her to increase quickly. Level six is a good peak as she can make cross card games and can easily enjoy her portages. It can allow her to play a little more aggressively as well. The first element should increase her overall power decently. Her damage will be significant, and she can spam her abilities frequently now."}
{"text": "As nunu, His tankness is out of bounds during this phase of the game. He can quickly shoot enemies and peel for his wears at the same time due to his overall tankness. A maximum-out Ultimate R will allow Nunu to flatten a lot of damage in a short period of time. If he can set up a death brush, he will automatically win the fight. His team fight at the end of the game will be extreme because he is very tanky, and his frontline ability will make it really easy for his team to succeed in the fights."}
{"text": "As shen, During this phase of the game, you should try again to save your portages from evil, especially during the fights where they can be flanked and killed. Your E is really effective around bottlenecks, so make sure to try CC several enemies with it sometimes. This should be quite useful if you can use the fog of war with it. Choose a high priority target that you want to protect during this phase of the game. Make sure they survive anything so that you can easily win team fights and get an advance."}
{"text": "As chogath, In general, this ability is his s. At level 11, Cho-Gath should put the second point in his Ultimate t. His death pressure increases considerably at this time. He should be stronger in the middle of the game as he will have won more defensive statistics thanks to the use of his party on minions and champions."}
{"text": "As fiora, If you are able to get a choice and heal your team with your Ultimate R quickly, the chances of winning the fight will be higher. Whenever your TP is down or your team is not very strong alone, stay with them and fight like 5 instead of playing divided."}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, In team fights, look out for his Ultimate r. He can either use it to protect an ally, or catch someone out of position. Keep this in mind when fighting.\n\nAvoid overextending alone in the mid lane without your team as he may use his W to get on top of you and start a fight.\n\nTry to burst Tahm Kench down before he is able to activate his E. CC is your best friend and he will not be able to activate it if he is locked down with CC."}
{"text": "As riven, Extremely weak when she is CC\u2019d as she can\u2019t use her dashes and can be killed easily. This allows the enemy team to pick her off before a major fight or when her e is on cooldown.\n\nToo steep of a learning curve, which makes it very hard for new players to master this champion. Effectiveness is reduced if the player can\u2019t cancel Auto-attack animations.\n\nVery hard for her to come back into the game if she falls behind early on. Very useful for the enemy team to gank her when she is pushed up or dive her when her r is on cooldown."}
{"text": "Against graves, The group against Graves will prevent him from taking key targets in the team fights because he will have trouble crossing several champions at a time. CC is also very good against him because he is quite still even with his Ultimate t et e. In the final stages of the laning phase and early in the middle of the game, he will try to kill isolated targets that walk through Summoners Rift alone. Stay walking around the map through the monitored areas only if he is ahead. Serious potential duelling and good clear wave means that he will seek to divide the thrust during the middle of the game. Force fights with his team when he is not able to impact the team fights."}
{"text": "As pyke, Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to use it frequently and increase the damage. It will be a huge ability during the middle of the game. He will have his basic items now, which means that he will do a lot of damage in a short time. His burst damage will be devastating. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow him to flatten a lot of damage and completely close squishy leds that are out of place."}
{"text": "As veigar, Veigar\u2019s level 6 is stronger than yours. With this in mind, play safer at level 6 and keep your distance so you have more time to react to his cage + all-in combo.\n\nStand away from the minion wave so he cannot push and poke you down simultaneously.\n\nPlay around his E cooldown. If you dodge it, abuse the long cooldown to gain a significant health advantage.\n\nTry and force him to over extend for farm by keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the map. You, your Support and your Jungler can then run him down the long lane."}
{"text": "As sett, Sett is great in extended trades thanks to his Q. As long as he can stick to an enemy champion, he should win 1v1 fights.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to both get tanks off his carries as well as deal a lot of damage to the enemy team if he manages to ult his target into them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant.\n\nHis Passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so he can resort to short burst trades against enemy champions unlike other tanks. His W does deceptively high damage as well, while providing damage mitigation to him."}
{"text": "Against twitch, After recalling, Twitch can enter the stealth track with its s. Avoid pushing too far when you know that Twitch has just supported as it can appear and go for a favorable trade. Twitch benefits from prolonged trades. Try to go for short trades bursts on long with it when possible. If Twitch pushed the wave and left the way, it is either trying to lure you and go for a trade, or it went to the medium track with its Support. Have a coherent vision around your way so that you know what it is doing and where it is going."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Malphite is at his weakest in the early game. Try to put him behind to delay his next power peak. At level 6, Malphite will get his Ultimate h. It's defensible the biggest power peak for him because it allows him to play more aggressive and start ruining his allies. Team fights are where Malphite really shines like his Ultimate h is an AOE ability and can shoot down several people."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be fighting unless you have a clear advantage early. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive games. You enjoy extended trades, so try to go for them frequently. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the card throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "As ryze, At this stage of the game, you want to get into a secondary track and focus on agriculture so you have a stronger game late. In the later parts of the middle game and when the enemy starts to group, make sure to follow the sequence and start grouping with your team. Use your ultimate R to get choices with your allies on enemies who are isolated or separated from their team. If you can catch someone, try to take the Dragon or Baron after."}
{"text": "As nautilus, By getting 3 points in his Ultimate e, he will use the ability quite often. Team fights will be a breeze for him from now on. His ability to make team fights unfair due to his selection potential will be quite obvious during this game phase. He only has Ultimate and his enemy out of sight. His tankness will not know any limits during this phase of the game."}
{"text": "As zeri, Her level 11 power spike is pretty strong. 2 points in her Ultimate R offer Zeri a lot of additional kill pressure.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Zeri would\u2019ve picked up several items. She will deal a lot of damage in fights and be able to solo carry them if she is ahead at this stage of the game.\n\nAt level 9, Zeri will max out her Q ability. As she uses this ability the most, her \u201cautos\u201d will deal a lot of damage.\n"}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a lot of pressure to kill in the middle of the game, especially once she puts 2 points in her Ultimate R. The reduction of the cooldown and the additional damage make her a huge threat during this stage of the game. Cass should have her tear stacked by this stage of the game. She will have a little endless mana pool once he is exhausted. At level 9, Cass goes max on her E. As long as she lands her Q, her brute potential will be incredibly powerful. Her all-in-in-fortune at this stage of the game."}
{"text": "Against rammus, Rammus is an early game ganker. Make sure you have pupils in the river or at its jungle entrances to reduce the efficiency of its ganks. It does not have the healthier first clear. If you are a strong early game champion, try to invade it on its first clear to put it behind the go. Rammus will activate its l close enough to a track but outside of the general guard spots to make it harder for the enemy to escape. Place slightly deeper pupils instead of keeping the usual pupils to give you more time to escape."}
{"text": "As tahmkench, It will keep you safe from the total potential of Tahm. Tahm has a good amount of mobility built in his kit so make sure you don't waste your dash freely. You are much more tanky than Tahm in this matchup so use this property to protect your allies. Do not do it easily can get your backline killed. Keep an eye on your allies in this matchup. If you see someone is low and in a skirmish, then immediately if the fight seems healthy."}
{"text": "As malphite, It's a tank against tank matchup. Your best bet is just to avoid them and focus on early farming. However, they are a stronger ganker than you in the game early, so be ready to counter-gank and follow them. If you can't get an advance of easy ganks, try to invade their jungle and steal their camps."}
{"text": "As shaco, You will want to riddle the lane brushes with your x and use them as cover to keep chunking your opposition out. It should be pretty easy to do during the early game.\n\nYour e isn't quite reliable during the early game so don't go around invading or trying to cheese the enemy Jungler. You may get easily collapsed on if you get caught out.\n\nLevel 6 will be a great spike for you as you will be able to dish out a lot of damage and your clone can easily disrupt a fight.        "}
{"text": "Against vladimir, Vladimir's l has an incredibly long cooldown during the laning phase. Find a way to bait him and then watch to play aggressive while he's on cooldown. Whenever Vladimir has his self-appointed Q available, play safer or walk backwards so he is forced to use his Q on the minion wave rather than you."}
{"text": "As morgana, During this phase of the game, Morgana will have several elements that will allow him to protect his team. Combined with his E, his allies will be protected from the CC. A maximum of Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability quite frequently and flatten a lot of damage at the same time. It will be great during the battles piled up. She is excellent in the fights at the end of the game due to her overall utility and CC on her Q. That CC can easily be chained with her Ultimate R for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, Mordekaiser has a healthy clear but slow clear in the early game. Try and invade him to steal away his camps to delay his first power spike.\n\nLuckily, Mordekaiser has rather scripted ganks. Place vision around his jungle entrances to spot him leave his jungle. If you\u2019re nearby, you could try to counter gank; but at the very least ping his position. \n\nOnce Mordekaiser hits level 6, he will find it slightly easier to gank with his Ultimate R. Try to equal his pressure by ganking as much as you can in the early game, and whenever he shows up on one side of the map, try to gank another lane or take an objective."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Once Aatrox reaches level 9, its Q will be maximized. The reduction of cooling time and additional precipitation will mean that this ability is on a very short cooling time. In the middle of the match, Aatrox will have brought elements that will reduce its cooling capabilities. Through levels 9-13 its capabilities will be on a very short cooling time. When Aatrox touches level 11 and puts two points in its Ultimate R, it will be a serious threat to the enemy in team fighting. Fight around your Ultimate to do a ton of damage and survive team fighting."}
{"text": "Against varus, Post 6, avoid extensing when you are defenseless. Varus. The Ultimate R can be used to catch you out of position and start a fight. Play safer whenever its Ultimate R is in place. Avoid standing inside the minion wave. This will allow Varus to poke and push the wave at the same time. Standing outside the minion wave will force him to choose between shovelling and poking with his Q. Varus will try his hardest for you poke out of the way. Try your hardest to avoid as much damage and abilities as possible. Opt for additional support if you can't dodge skill shots."}
{"text": "As malzahar, A fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow Malzahar to dish out hefty amounts of damage. Enchanters and squishy targets will have a hard time.\n\nHe is solid during late-game fights as his Q and Ultimate R will hit like a truck now. He will need to check the enemy inventory for a QSS before he decides to all-in a champion, though.\n\nHis Q and E will be maxed out and will be doing many consistent DPS during this phase of the game. The Q will let him keep the wave in check as well."}

Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the objective to make it easier to secure the mid lane tower.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate R is up, try to use it on the enemy lakers to get their health low.

{"text": "As amumu, Make sure you are present in any particular team fight during this phase of the game. Do not waste on any other way to accumulate CS to get an element. Make a point to check your team's positioning before starting a fight. There is no point to start a fight when your team can't follow on you. Flanking the enemy team and using the war fog for bamboozle enemies is the way to go during this phase of the game. Make sure you keep it right at all times."}
{"text": "As rammus, He is highly tanky during the mid-game and will act as a very potent frontline for his team.\n\nAnother point in his Ultimate 2 will give him a significant damage boost and will let him get picks frequently.\n\nTeam fighting is where Rammus excels the most. He can quickly chase down enemies, and choke point fights are his bread and butter.        "}
{"text": "Against mordekaiser, At level 6, Mordekaisers kill pressure increases. Every time his Ultimate R is at the top, you have to play more respectfully. Mordekaiser has a strong all-in-all potential as soon as it reaches level 3, but before it can be pushed out of the way. Abuse it as much as possible before it touches level 3. Team fighting is where Mordekaiser can shine. If you are a carrier champion, make sure to invest in a QSS so you can get out of his Ultimate R."}

Every time he uses his Ultimate R, try to abuse cooldown and play aggressive while he goes down. Once he has the maximum reduction of cooldown, Zilean, Ultimate t} will be on a very short cooldown. It will be harder to get choices during the middle and the end of the game as he will save them with his Ultimate t."}
{"text": "Against volibear, At level 3, Volibear can gank a lane as he\u2019ll have access to his Q. Expect him to look for a level 3 gank.\n\nAfter Volibear has completed his jungling item, he will be incredibly strong and hard to deal with. Avoid fighting him unless you have a clear advantage.\n\nVolibear gains a lot of trading power once he hits level 6 and has his Ultimate R available. Ping your allies if they\u2019re low on health and you notice Volibear nearby. "}
{"text": "As maokai, Very weak during the early match and can easily be killed, especially if the enemy he is confronted finds himself being varied in nature. Grievous Wounds are a must buy against him during the early match. He prevents him from healing much, especially when he uses his W, Q engage on a target. Controlling the appropriate vision of the enemy team will remove any form of chance of flanking that Maokai can exploit in order to initiate an all-in. This will reduce Maokai's effectiveness."}
{"text": "As akali, Focus on staying healthy and farming up till you gain access to your W, E, and R. In the meantime, try to land your Q on both the minion wave and the enemy champion.\n\nSince you use Energy, and your abilities are energy hungry, you should always take a look at your resource bar before attempting an all-in. Keep a track of the enemy Jungler from the beginning of the game as he will attempt to camp your lane till you hit level six.\n\nUse your E discretely in this lane as it allows you to both all-in and disengage against enemies. Your goal should be to get your first item as quickly as you can so that your all-ins become more potent and deadly."}
{"text": "As drmundo, His items will make him very tanky during this stage and combined with his Passive and Ultimate R, he will be a behemoth for the enemy team. Taking him down will be nearly impossible and hence he will be able to completely separate the enemy team's backline from their frontline.\n\nHe is at his strongest when his Ultimate R is up. He can straight up dive the enemy team and completely disrupt their team fighting by just walking towards them.\n\nDr.Mundo's Q can allow him to secure picks for his team. The slow can enable his team to follow up on that target with hard CC abilities, or straight up just all-in and burst them down."}
{"text": "As gragas, Peel for your carries during team fights to ensure that they can do their job of dealing consistent damage to the enemy. If you decide to all-in an enemy, just perform your all-in combo and return to your carries.\n\nTry to work with your Jungler and get picks inside the enemy Jungle with your Ultimate R. Even picking off the enemy Support will grant your team a considerable advantage when it comes to vision placements. \n \nSet death brushes when possible and use your Ultimate R to bring unsuspecting enemies close to you. This will let your team collapse on them and kill them."}
{"text": "As fiora, At level 11, Fiora\u2019s Ultimate R will be much better. Putting a second point in her Ultimate R is vital and her 1v1 kill pressure increases.\n\nFiora is good in the mid-game and will be looking to split push. She should be able to draw a lot of attention for her team so they can get stuff done elsewhere like the Dragon or Baron.\n\nAt level 9, Fiora will max out her Q. This is a very important power spike for her as it will allow her to look for more aggressive plays, help her farm and also help her escape sticky situations thanks to the low cooldown."}
{"text": "As swain, Multiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take over fights much easily. His damage output will be pretty phenomenal as well.\n\nHis mid-game presence and fighting style is really great. He can zone off enemies and separate the enemy front line from the backline. He can also pick off-targets.\n\nThe first ability will be maxed at level 9, adding a lot of burst damage to his kit. It helps Swain get rid of squishy targets quickly.        "}
{"text": "As teemo, Level six is the 'power spike' for Teemo. It will let him be extraordinarily obnoxious and sneaky now, especially as the game progresses.\n\nHis ganks won't be quite potent early on as the enemy can easily see him coming during ganks. He should make sure that he bypasses vision when possible and runs around with a Sweeper and a Control Ward at all times.\n\nThe first item component will increase his overall damage in the game. This will help him in duels and will allow him to use his spells frequently as well.        "}
{"text": "As yasuo, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "Against reksai, Rek-Sai is good for selecting players in the middle and at the end of the game. Avoid walking around Rift Summoners alone as she could just target you. CC or Rek-Sai burst down as soon as she engages with her E. This will make it incredibly difficult for her to cover the damage or escape after entering. Rek-Sai fights in 5v5 team fights, so try to force them instead of separating and playing alone. If all 5 of your allies are grouped, it will be harder for her to engage safely without dying."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate n is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate n is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As rengar, After entering with your Ultimate R, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. Look for peaks in the later stages of the game. If you can choose someone, you should be able to turn to the Baron or the Old Dragon. Keep a constant eye on what major goal is fresh next. Do not divide push or go to the opposite side of the map when a major goal is high or about to spawn."}
{"text": "As karma, She has excellent waveclear and splash damage with her Q. This allows her to get lane priority and help her other laners/Jungler when they are contesting objectives.\n\nHer d allows her to shield everyone in her team. It also allows her to increase the movement speed of the allied team, which can help them catch out an over extended enemy.\n\nWhen fighting 1 v 1 she practically doesn\u2019t have a weakness when all of her spells are up. If someone tries to come close to her, she can just Q them and run away, If she is getting engaged upon, she can use her d and Ultimate a empowered d to both disengage and get back a lot of health. Her Ultimate a is the backbone of her strength in the lane and proper usage will let her get ahead."}
{"text": "Against twistedfate, Twisted Fate will look for peaks with his Ultimate there in the middle of the game. Avoid dividing too far to reduce his ability to get peaks. As Destiny gives him a lot of card pressure, expect him to be split in the middle of the game. Although you could fight with the number advantage, make sure to keep an eye on him so you can disengage if he makes his way for the fight. Twisted Fate will look for poke as much as possible before launching. Do not allow him to poke by engaging as soon as you spot him."}
{"text": "As gragas, Peel for your carts during the team fights to make sure they can do their job of inflicting consistent damage to the enemy. If you decide to do everything in an enemy, just perform your all-in combo and return to your carts. Try to work with your Jungler and get peaks inside the enemy Jungle with your Ultimate R. Even the withdrawal of the enemy Support will give your team a considerable advantage in terms of vision placements."}
{"text": "As jayce, Jayce will not be too hard at level 11 because he will not give him as much statistics or utility as the ultimate of most other champions. This will certainly allow him to increase his overall bursting damage, however. Once he will maximize his s at level 9, he will be able to extinguish a lot of damage. This is especially true if Jayce hides in the fog of the war and manages to break up an enemy unsuspectingly with his combo w > s. This can also be done from the track brushes if the enemy does not protect them. Jayce's poke is directly proportional to the number of items and components he has at the time."}
{"text": "As veigar, Your complete construction will allow you to kill squishy targets with an e and Ultimate R. Moreso, your Ultimate R will be frequently at the top, hence to use it liberally. Try CC multiple targets at once during this phase of the game. Your AoE damage potential is really high and can completely erase a team if you time it well. Do not wander alone in the unrewarded areas of the card. You are already still, and anyone with a dash or spelling shield can kill you."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, In team fights, as soon as Aatrox runs in, try to CC him and burst him down first. He is pretty vulnerable to CC and if you can kill him before he gets his combo off, the enemy will lose out on a lot of damage.\n \nTry to look for fights when Aatrox doesn\u2019t have his Ultimate or Flash. He will have a much harder time at impacting fights when either of these are on cooldown.\n \nAatrox likes to split push after the laning phase has ended. When he shows in a side lane alone, you could try and start a team fight with his teammates. Have wards on that side of the map though just in case he makes his way to join the fight."}
{"text": "As morgana, Use the fog of war to get picks with your Q and W. Your E should be on a shorted cooldown as well, so use it freely.\n\nIf you are not that fed, consider using your E to shield an ally acting as the carry. Such an ally getting CC'd will mean demise for your team.\n\nBefore going for neutral objectives, try to set a death brush and kill any enemy who decides to blindly check the lane brushes. This will help you massively with securing objectives effortlessly."}
{"text": "As kayn, When counter ganking Kayn, use your Ultimate on the other laner not Kayn.\n\nWard for your allies! Kayn is way stronger than you early, and you can decrease their early power by warding for your allies, so they do not die to ganks.\n\nPlaying around your Ultimate is key in this matchup. You\u2019re wasting ganking opportunities when you\u2019re sitting on your Ultimate and not ganking your allies.\n\nMake sure you place wards at your jungle entrances so you can spot them before they jump on you. River wards and wards at your jungle entrances are key to counter Kayn.\n"}
{"text": "As ekko, After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nFlank in team fights with your W and E to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Continue grouping with your team and staying near your Support. If you\u2019re ever too far forward, the enemy may look to pick you off. Stay towards the backside of your team.\n\nWatch your positioning at all times in team fights. Try to stay at the maximum distance possible to increase your chances of dishing out damage and surviving the team fight.\n\nTry and use the range from your e and the poke from your y to harass the enemy as often as possible before a team fight occurs. Do this without putting yourself in a poor position if possible."}
{"text": "As veigar, Very immobile and is extremely vulnerable to crowd control. He has a weak early game as well, so he can easily be abused and killed with a few ganks.\n\nHis n is on a really long cooldown, and it is his only form of self-peel. Once it is down, he can be easily all-in\u2019d and killed with crowd control.\n\nHe will take a lot of time to come online if he happens to get killed a few times during the early game. He isn\u2019t going to be very effective if the game goes on for too long so try to shut him down early and end the game quickly."}
{"text": "As graves, His first ability will be maximized at level 9, which will help Graves to strengthen his overall break-up of damage in the Jungle. His clearings and ganks will be more effective accordingly. Due to his articles, he will have a lot of pressure to kill during the middle of the game. His e and e will also allow him to catch the out-of-guard enemies, and he can kill them very quickly because of his passive. At level 11, Graves will have two points in his ultimate t. This means that the potential of this ability to finish the ill-health enemies increases considerably, especially if it goes for the construction of the lethality."}
{"text": "Against kogmaw, Kog\u2019Maw is rather squishy in the early game. Try to abuse his weakness and look for fights to set him behind.\n\nPost-6, Kog\u2019Maw will deal lots of damage in a trade thanks to his e and his Ultimate y. Try to bait out his e before committing to the all-in.\n\nNote that Kog\u2019maw will be trying to constantly poke you from afar in lane to get you low. Look into buying an early pair of Boots to make dodging his abilities easier."}
{"text": "As rumble, Another point in his Ultimate b will seriously tip team fights in chokingpoints in his favor. All he needs to do is time it well and drop it at the appropriate places. He will now have several items at his disposal. This means that his damage will increase considerably, and it should have an easy time to melt through the enemy health bars. The presence of Rumble during mid-game fights is really fabulous. He should be able to win several fights just by using his Ultimate b correctly."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too.

Keep this in mind and try to fight him when there isn\u2019t one.\n\nAt level 6, ping that Gangplank has his Ultimate R. It\u2019s key that your team knows that he can use his Ultimate R to impact a fight. \n\nGangplank is rather weak in the early game and needs time to come online. Try and abuse his weak early game to get ahead."}
{"text": "As viego, Having 3 points in his Ultimate R will help Viego to take the game effortlessly. His brilliant damage will increase considerably, and he will melt through the enemy team. His Ultimate R will come in very practical during the fights at the end of the game. His ability to target the lowest health enemy will make a quick work of enemies who managed to escape with a burst of health. Viego is decent in the team fights, mainly if he uses the fog of the war and his E to reach the enemy backline. He can even use his E to zone the enemy out without even trying to kill anyone."}
{"text": "As kalista, It is important that you stick with your team in the late game. Do not move around the map or go anywhere unless someone is with you.\n\nStand towards the back end of your team near your Support. Avoid walking too far away from anyone in the late game. Getting caught out will result in the enemy being able to push their advantage and finish the game.\n\nWatch your positioning in the late game. Focus on kiting and auto-attacking the nearest enemy champion. Avoid walking too far forward so you do not get caught out and focused by the enemy."}
{"text": "As azir, Just like in the mid-game, Azir doesn\u2019t spike at level 16 either. While an extra point in his Ultimate R will come in handy, it is not going to make or break him.\n\nAt level 13, Azir will max out both his W and his r. He should be a real terror at this stage of the game and he will be able to dish out a lot of damage in a short amount of time.\n\nPaired with his level 13 power spike and picking up more and more items, Azir\u2019s late game is very strong."}
{"text": "As poppy, During team fights, make sure that the enemy can't come close to your carries and soak up as much damage as possible for them. Use your Passive to defend yourself.\n\nBuying a defensive item will help you a lot in this game. It will allow you to all-in enemies freely, and the enemy will take a lot of time trying to kill you.\n\nCling to the enemy carries like glue to create a rift between the enemy frontline and the backline. This way, the enemy will definitely lose the fight, and then you can win the game."}
{"text": "As samira, Once she has 2 points in her Ultimate R, she can easily take over the team fights and disrupt them. Her positioning will be the determining factor from now on. Samira is excellent in mid-game fights because she can overthrow the enemies if she gets her S-rank. This, combined with her mobility and life theft, will prevent her from dying. Her first ability will be maximized at level 9."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, When no team fights are occurring, move to a side lane and focus on farming and earning XP and gold.\n\nIn team fights, try to flank the enemy. This will increase your chances of getting a good Ultimate R off.\n\nLook for fights inside tight spots of the map or get picks with your Ultimate R. CC\u2019ing a key target will make fighting so much easier."}
{"text": "As kayn, Peel for your allies in the late game, especially if you\u2019re Red Kayn. Keeping them alive and focusing the champion they\u2019re focusing will increase your chances of winning the fight.\n\nGroup with your team in the late game. You can play off to the side slightly if you\u2019re ahead and are able to assassinate someone.\n\nContinue to focus objectives like the Baron or Dragon. Getting a pick could provide you with enough time to do the Baron."}
{"text": "As alistar, At level 16, Alistar will have put 3 points in his Ultimate. With the reduction of the insane damage this ability offers him, he should be able to survive all the team fights for a long time. The teams will regroup in the late parts of the game. This is good for Alistar because he will always be able to get a multi-person with his combo."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Place vision around his jungle entrances to make it harder for Wukong to get successful ganks off.\n\nWukong has good objective control in the early game. Try to take it before him if possible, or at least keep it warded at all times so you can spot him before he is able to take it for free.\n\nWukong is very strong in a 1v1 fight if he has lots of health. Avoid fighting him if you spot him when he is very healthy. Especially if he has his Ultimate n available."}
{"text": "As diana, Try to flank in team fights with your Q and t to get on to the enemy backline and shut them down. Flank from the side instead of running directly towards the enemy as they\u2019ll be able to disengage or poke you down.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nAvoid overextending or dying alone. When you\u2019re dead, the enemy may be able to siege an objective, start a fight or secure the Baron or Dragon."}
{"text": "Against annie, Annie is clearly stronger when her dizziness is ready, and when she has 3 piles on her passive. Whenever she has her dizziness ready, you must respect her damage yield and her ability to trade with you. Annie is strong during the middle of the game and in team fights (if she can get a multi-person dizziness). If possible, don't walk on the map alone and without your team."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, After going in with your Ultimate n, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate n in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate n is up. Fighting without it will make the late game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown. "}
{"text": "As tryndamere, When Tryndamere has completed his Mythic item, he will be really strong in 1v1 skirmishes with the enemy. He will also be really mobile and hard to kill thanks to his Ultimate e and E.\n\nAt level 6, Tryndamere will be unstoppable and will not die in 1v1 fights. He will be really hard to kill when his Ultimate e is up.\n\nTryndamere has good objective control and can easily solo the Dragon and Rift Herald in the early game. Try to take them if you can do them uncontested.\n"}
{"text": "Against karma, Delaying a team fight will allow him to harass your team and make the fight much more risky. If Karma uses her self-appointed Q while trying to poke, you should use the cooldown to start a team fight. When Karmas Ultimate is downstairs, she can't give her team a huge shield that will make the fight much easier. Don't be afraid to invest in an execution call. This will reduce her healing and shielding and it will make the victory of the team fight much easier."}
{"text": "As anivia, Every time Anivias Passive fails, she is incredibly vulnerable to an all-in. Play safer every time he is on the cooldown. Pre-6, Anivia has a minimal threat in the way. She must play safe and wait for her level 6 peak power before starting to follow correctly. Focus on agriculture and play safe in early play. Anivia relies heavily on the mana throughout all stages of the game."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille Support's first power peak is at level 2 and 3. It can play aggressively, but should only do so if its ADC can play aggressively too. Its next major power peak is at level 6. A good Camille will constantly seek to play every time this ability is out of cooldown. After getting its first component, its trading power in the track increases a little."}
{"text": "As varus, At level 16, Varus will be able to add 3 points in his Ultimate R. It will increase the damage dealt by the ability while simultaneously reducing the cooldown.\n\nVarus will have a lot of items during this stage of the game. This will let him dish out a lot of damage, and his burst potential due to his W will be phenomenal.\n\nVarus is excellent in team fights due to his Q and Ultimate R. A good Ultimate R can literally allow Varus' team to win a significant battle with minimal effort."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks is weak in early play. He has to hit Level 6 as fast as he can so he can unlock his Ultimate R and start gaunting his allies. After Fiddlesticks has taken his first component element, he will be a little stronger and he will be able to start doing a lot of damage to enemies when he ganks his allies. After Fiddle has finished his first element, his damage output will increase considerably. As long as you are playing around your Ultimate R, you will be very strong after finishing your first element."}
{"text": "Against senna, The more the game goes, the stronger Senna will be in the team fights. Try to put an end to the game as quickly as possible so that she is unable to be really effective in the middle of the game. Close Senna as quickly as you can in a team fight. This will reduce her ability to bring you down, inflict damage and win the fight. If you can't close it quickly, you might need to flank her and attack on the side. Play around Sennas Ultimate R. If she uses it, you have a long cooldown to abuse her and her team."}
{"text": "As senna, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, The last point in his Ultimate n will allow him to inflict enormous damage to the enemies. He should try to look for flanks during the team fights to maximize his use Ultimate n. He will now have a lot of articles, which will really make him tanky and allow him to inflict a lot and a lot of damage in a short time. The enemy team will have trouble dealing with him. Wukong is quite substantial during this phase of the game. Yet, he will find it hard to kill them because of their purchase of defensive items. You will want to group with your team as often as you can."}
{"text": "As jinx, Has no form of mobility and can easily be all-in\u2019d once her E is down. Any kill against her sets her back by miles as she is a heavy scaling ADC, and needs to farm safely.\n\nAtrocious early game as she does no damage during that stage and is very vulnerable to all-ins. She can easily be zoned out of CS, which is not a good thing for her as she needs her core items to be useful.\n\nHer effectiveness will decrease if she runs out of mana in the lane. This is due to how her Q rockets work. It will take away her long-range CS ability, which will allow the enemy to zone her off easily."}
{"text": "As renata, During this phase of the game, you will want to focus on team fights only. Use your Ultimate R liberally and try to W carries that are about to die.\n\nKeep poking out enemies with your E and see if you can displace them with your Q. You should be able to deal with the enemy front line this way.\n\nBe a part of neutral objective fights frequently and see if you can target the enemy Jungler. This will prevent the enemy Jungler from getting their Smite off on the enemy."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, Shyvana is weak in the early game, but if you trade with her when she has a lot of minions, it will not matter.\n\nAt level 6, Shyvana gets access to a whole new kit. She will be much stronger when she has her Ultimate t. Furthermore, when she has a lot of Fury, she will be a lot scarier too.\n\nShyvana\u2019s power spikes depend on her build path. She will spike differently depending on if she goes AP or AD."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Level 16 isn't that great as it bolsters her roaming potential and nothing else. No additional damage is dealt by her due to that added point in her Ultimate R.\n\nMost of her abilities will be maxed out during this phase of the game. It will let her deal a lot of damage if she can combo her abilities carefully.\n\nShe will be dealing a lot of consistent burst damage during this phase of the game. All she needs to do is maintain her positioning and just land her abilities."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Pantheon is an early to mid game champion and is therefore very strong from levels 1 to 6 and can influence other lanes too when he gets his R.\n\nIf Pantheon gets 1 or 2 kills, he can finish Youmuu's Ghostblade and his other core items faster. Pay attention to what active items he has and try to play around them. \n\nBe careful after the laning phase, as Pantheon will try to kill you with Grand Starfall R and force a 5 vs 4.\n"}
{"text": "Against lucian, * In team fights, take care that Lucian can use his E to reposition and escape danger. Try and wait for him to use his  E before using your CC abilities so it\u2019s harder for him to dodge them. \n* Avoid letting Lucian get a full channel of his Ultimate R on you in a team fight by disengaging or cancelling it with CC. \n* Lookout for Lucian\u2019s positioning. He will often walk forward in order to land auto attacks. Once he has mispositioned, use this to your advantage to focus him down."}
{"text": "As thresh, At level 9, Thresh will have his first ability maxed out. This means that he will be able to secure more picks in a short duration of time.\n\nThresh will have two abilities maxed out at level thirteen. This will bolster his overall all-in potential, making him the primary engager and playmaker for the team.\n\nThresh's main power comes from his ability to pick off champions during the mid-game. This is really important towards winning the game, and he will have an easy time doing it if he roams around a lot."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac is decent enough during team fighting, especially if he can use the fog of war to his advantage. He will be able to multiple CC targets and completely decimate the opposition if they are not careful. The obtaining of two points in his Ultimate R will increase the overall damage he deals with and will decrease the cooling of capacity. This means that Zac will be able to look for peaks more frequently. At level 9, he will have his first maximum ability. He will have a massive range advantage from now on and will be able to run roams effectively."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille can't really start trading too well up to level 4. Once she unlocked all her abilities and has several points in her Q, she can start trading. Camille next peak of power in the track is when she unlocks her Ultimate R. He offers her a lot of pressure to kill and is good to set up her Jungler. If you can't make use of her in your own way, you could wander with her to help your allies. Once Camille has finished her first component, her ability to trade with the enemy will intensify."}
{"text": "Against senna, Senna will look to dominate you in the early game. Expect her to play aggressively at level 1 to gain a health advantage.\n\nOnce Senna is level 6, her map pressure and kill pressure increases. Ping once she is level 6 so your team knows that she can influence a fight with her Ultimate R.\n\nThe longer the game goes, the stronger Senna\u2019s Passive will be.

If you get caught out or the enemy initiates a fight while you\u2019re not there, the enemy will win the team fight.\n\nPoke and delay team fights while you and your team harass the enemy and get them low.

You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map throughout the early game.

{"text": "Against shyvana, Shyvana will look for aggressive plays and aggressive trades early. Keep this in mind.\n\nAvoid pushing the wave constantly. Shyvana has great all-in and chase potential. Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map will reduce her chances of running you down the lane.\n\nIf you see that Shyvana has her Ultimate t, avoid over-committing to all-ins as she could just escape. For instance, don\u2019t Flash for her unless her Ultimate t is down."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble is excellent during the end-of-game fights that its Ultimate b and its basic capabilities will all hit like a truck now, especially during the team fights. Maxing its Ultimate b will reduce the cooldown of the ability and allow it to use it frequently. This will be a decisive factor during the objective fights. Rumble will dry up a lot of damage during this phase of the game. Its ability to melt through the enemy health bars will force its enemies to play defensively."}
{"text": "As lulu, Her late game is phenomenal as she can peel for her team for days. No one can come close to her team as long as her W and Ultimate R are up.\n\nLulu's Ultimate R at level 16 is a force to reckon with. It will be challenging for the enemy team to eliminate Lulu's team due to the short cooldown of the ability, and killing Lulu will really become next to impossible.\n\nLulu will be full build by this time in the game. Her shielding potential will be out of the world, and she can enable her entire team if she manages to use her abilities properly."}
{"text": "As elise, Elise can start crashing after reaching level 3. She can technically gank at level 2 if she takes her second E, but after 3 she should crash for sure. Elise does not point to level 6 as she has her Ultimate at level 1. When she gets away with the enemy, keep in mind that their Ultimate will be more useful than yours. After Elise has taken her first element, her death pressure increases considerably."}
{"text": "As maokai, Maokai is really good at ganting because his W is point and click on CC. Walk up to a laner and use it on them for an easy murder. His R Ultimate can allow him to set up engages at a great distance. This is extremely beneficial when it is used out of sight, or when enemies are near a wall. Provides a lot of vision with his E, which also makes room for the control of the brush. Combine his E slow with his W, he can practically steal a target and CC for a while while while his team just tracking it on him."}

{"text": "As ziggs, As Ziggs gets more items, he will be causing a lot of mayhem in terms of damage. This means that Ziggs can easily poke enemies out to make the team fights massively unfair for the enemy.\n\nOnce Ziggs gets three points in his Ultimate R, he will deal a massive amount of damage in a huge area during team and objective fights. Fighting in clumped areas will give a tremendous advantage to Ziggs as well.\n\nZiggs is quite good at taking towers quickly. Still, as he gets more items, he will completely decimate them with his Passive empowered auto-attacks. After that, he can just chunk the tower out with his W, which means that the enemy can't do anything to defend their tower."}
{"text": "As talon, Before invading, make sure that you have your passive stacked so that you can win the trade. If they invade you, be ready to fight, but only do so if your passive is stacked and you can win, otherwise just step back.

{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus doesn\u2019t want to fight in the early game. Instead, he wants to focus on farming and stacking his Q. Try to fight him when he is focused on stacking as he may focus on the farm rather than fighting you- which will allow you to gain a health advantage. \n\nDo not push Nasus under his turret as it allows him to farm safely. Instead, freeze the lane towards your side of the map so he has to overextend for farm.\n\nOnce Nasus has some levels behind him and has multiple points in his W, he will have good gank set up. You\u2019ll need to play safer if the wave is closer to his side of the map during this time so you don\u2019t die from ganks."}
{"text": "As galio, Great potential for engagement with his E, with the CC extended with his W. This combo can deal with respectable amounts of damage and also allow his team to follow the hit target with ease. Has a decent amount of vaguelight on his Q that he can use to push the wave in and then wander around to see if he can use his Ultimate R to help other teammates. He doesn't have to wander too far for that, so he can get back on the track quickly if the all-in-possessed. His Ultimate R strikes prevents the enemy team from playing in a pooled formation that could literally get them killed in the next 2.5 seconds. His W plays a pivotal role during team fighting in such situations."}
{"text": "As naafiri, At level 16, you will have put the third and final point in your Ultimate. You will be strong enough and your all-in-pot potential will be high. In the late part, you will start to fall a bit because the teams will be grouped together so you have to play with your team. The enemy group together will reduce your chances of getting choices.

Even if Caitlyn is strong, it cannot fill a lot of damage. Kite retreats to increase your chances of survival. Reserve your E purely as an escape tool if the enemy has an all-in-one fort. Even if your Support often escapes to the guard, make sure to stay with them as much as possible. If you are alone, the enemy can try to set up an ambush and get you off. Avoid walking through nonwarded parts of the map during the middle of the game."}
{"text": "As viego, The level six is a massive power peak because Viego will be able to unlock a powerful finishing capacity. It can help a lot in clutch situations where Viego needs to execute his target quickly. Its early death pressure is really high since all he needs to do is to land his W and then follow him with his Qs and auto-attacks. This combo becomes much more devastating once Viego gets his Ultimate R. His first element will give him a massive boost in solo lacquering."}

This is huge for him as he can now CC enemies and then combo them with his r and e when possible.\n\nLevel six is a significant power spike as it gives him access to his finishing ability.

{"text": "As riven, The first element will allow her to do a lot of damage and survive the way. It will also be favorable when trying to go for all-in combos. Level six is a massive peak for her because she can now affect the fights easily with her ts and r. Its use will dictate how good a Riven is. She is a decent champion early, especially if she manages to use the track brushes to her advantage in the way. Her all-in combo will be quite powerful if she catches her out-of-guard enemies."}

{"text": "Against aatrox, In the team fights, as soon as Aatrox leaves, try the CC and blow him up first. He's pretty vulnerable to the CC, and if you can kill him before he has his combo, the enemy will lose on a lot of damage. Try to look for the fights when Aatrox doesn't have his Ultimate or Flash. He'll have a lot more time to hit the fights when either of them are about to cool off. Aatrox likes to split the thrust after the laning phase. When he shows up in a single side track, you could start a team fight with his teammates."}
{"text": "Against rakan, At level 1, play respectfully. If it takes W at level 1, it can look for an early engagement and force you to blow your Flash. It tends to do it against utility supports when they walk forward to harass. Play towards the opposite side of the way at any time. This will make it harder for Rakan to get a successful engagement on you or your door. If Rakan misses his W, you should try to abuse cooldown and play aggressive."}

After using your e and k, fall back and protect your allies and focus the nearest champion.\n\nLook for picks with your Ultimate e. If you can catch someone out when the enemy is unorganised, you\u2019ll be able to force a team fight or an objective afterwards."}
{"text": "Against zac, Zac can gank at level 2 or 3 depending on the ability that he went second. Expect to gank your way to level 3. Zac is really good in team fights because his kit has tons of CC. Try to disengage whenever he E.S.I. engages to make it harder for him to get a good knockup. Once Zac touches level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate R, his gank and kills the pressure increases."}
{"text": "As morgana, Focus on moving the wave with your W and use your Q only when you are able to guarantee a blow. The lack of capacity will allow the enemy of everything within you. Your E will save you from a lot of trouble in this way. Just make sure that you use it properly before you are CC'd or take a lot of magic damage. You can even use it as a tool for all-in enemies. Once you get your ultimate R, you should be able to dominate the enemy quickly. Try to be part of as many combats as possible to make practical use of the Ultimate R."}

This is because her Ultimate R will now have two points and won't let her or her carries die that easily.\n\nLulu's effectiveness in team fights really comes into play during this phase of the game.

He will have to check the enemy's inventory for a QSS before he decides to do everything in a champion, however.

If you don't regroup, she'll just force a fight with her Ultimate R, so make sure you're grouped as a team. Poke, disengagement and CC will reduce Sejuani's ability.

They have the advantage of the range and if you're standing too far forward, they'll harass you for free. Don't let Heimerdinger harass you and make you fall. If you lose a lot of health, you'll never be able to play aggressively."}
{"text": "Against morgana, Morgana is good at level 6 when she unlocks her Ultimate R. Until then, her kill pressure isn\u2019t the best, but it does increase once this ability is unlocked.\n\nOnce Morgana has Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass, her survivability in team fights will increase. Try and fight her when her Zhonya\u2019s is down so she is unable to defend herself. \n\nWhenever Morgana has her Blackshield E available, her protection increases dramatically and it will be difficult for you to kill her or the ADC when she can block CC. Try to fight when this ability is down."}
{"text": "As riven, After entering with your Ultimate e, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you are gone. Play around your Ultimate e in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate e is standing. Fighting with outside will make the fights of the late game team much harder."}
{"text": "As darius, When you do the team fight, look to peel and focus on the nearest enemy champion. You are Darius, not a murderer and you will have trouble killing anyone alone. But, you can absorb the damage and provide loads at the same time. When no team fight occurs, look to divide the thrust and try to fight the enemy who is trying to stop you. Darius is a strong 1v1 champion and can fight most of the streetlights that are set against him. Use your ultimate e at an appropriate time in each fight."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Don't fight him when his e is up. Once he's down there, look at him and kill him. Your mobility is your pillar in this matchup. Use him to avoid Kog'Maw's damage, then fight him and kill him. Choosing him at the end of the game should help you a lot in this matchup. Once he's down there, his team won't have a lot of DPS left in them. Keep the wave near your turn and see if you can expose him to the ganks."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a powerful level 2 all in with her Q and E spam. Make sure you hit level 2 at the same time which is the first wave followed by 1 melee minion on the second wave to reduce her ability to kill you.\n\nCassiopeia has mana issues in the early game. If she is low on mana, it could be a good time to fight her as her damage output will be heavily reduced as she relies heavily on mana to trade.\n\nShe is an immobile Mage with no escapes. Let her push the wave and then call for assistance from your Jungler to shut her down."}
{"text": "Against maokai, Avoid standing down the track as Maokai will place Saplings E inside the bushes and they will inflict a lot of damage if you are taken by them. Make sure to hit Level 2 at the same time or before Maokai as it has great all-in-level 2. At Level 1, if you are not sure of the ability it has taken, make sure to stand back and out of range just in case it starts W, it can not gain an early health benefit. In early play, try to use your range advantage for the poke and harass it. Try and stay at the maximum range although it can not get on you with its W."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, You can use the digital advantage to force goals or look for favorable fights to win an advantage. If Tryndamere is divided by pushing into the bottom of the game, avoid sending a lot of people to stop him when Baron. It will take you some time to kill him even if you hire 5 champions to kill him who could give his team a lot of time to take the Baron. Try to fight when Tryndamere doesn't have his Ultimate e}up. It will make it incredibly hard for him to straighten out a lot of damage in a team fight."}
{"text": "As camille, In the last game, Camille is good at choosing champions with his Ultimate R. It should be on a cool down low and if you are able to Ult R the right champion (like a cart), you could win the game. Although you have a good potential of choice, the enemy will start building defensive statistics that will make it harder for you to kill the carts on your own. Keep this in mind when you dive with your E. Although you will find it harder to kill carts on your own, you will be quite tanky and will suffer a lot of damage thanks to the items you buy."}
{"text": "As sion, Versatile build path. He can go either AD or full tank depending on his team\u2019s needs.\n\nPost 6, it will be hard to track Sion as he can gank lanes from afar with his Ultimate R.\n\nReally good at cheesing and taking down enemies who are walking around Summoners Rift alone by hiding in bushes and channelling his Q"}
{"text": "As braum, Roam around the map and look for picks with your r. If you can catch someone, call for a nearby objective and abuse their death timer.\n\nPlace vision around the mid lane and where ever you and your ADC are currently playing. This will increase your chances of surviving an all-in.\n\nStick with your ADC throughout the mid-game. If you\u2019re alone, you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy. Similarly, if your ADC is alone, they might try to collapse on them and kill them."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Mordekaiser will take some time to be really overpowering in the lane, so he will need to play safely for that duration. Conserving health is the way to go.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive spike for Mordekaiser as he can now use his Ultimate R and 1 v 1 anyone he desires.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to fight more efficiently. His damage will be pretty significant as well.        "}
{"text": "Against ahri, Ahri is rather weak in early play. Look for the poke and fight during that time to get a good start from get-go. Post-6, Ahri has a lot of potential for pursuit thanks to her Ultimate. Do not stretch when you are weak as she can easily kill you and put you behind. Once Ahri has finished her first article, she will inflict a lot of damage and be able to push the wave/combat more frequently. Keep this in mind and respect her all-in damage."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Can deal heavy amounts of burst damage in a very short time, which gives the enemy very little time to react. One such C E Q combo can ruin the enemy laners life.\n\nHer Ultimate R allows her to traverse a long distance almost immediately and can provide a lot of utility in choke points. This will also give her traction to easily land her C.\n\nHer E is really effective against enemies who have some form of dash. She can thus make life a living hell for laners who rely a lot on dashes."}
{"text": "As shaco, Shaco's level one is a decent time to set up his boxes around the lane and catch enemies off guard. Not many Supports will take Sweeper first, so he should have a gala time in the bot lane.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike as he can now bait enemies and annoy them massively during fights. He can easily control it from out of vision and make enemies think that it is the real Shaco they are dealing with.\n\nHis first item will give him a massive damage boost and enable him to quickly burst down enemies. He can also get multiple kills while roaming around the map."}
{"text": "As shaco, It is not only a physical threat, but the mental war it instills on the enemy squishies allows Shaco to make multiple pieces that other Champions cannot make. It can leave the way and wander easily enough to get a cheese gank (even if it is laning). Its x can allow it to disengage as well as surprise all-in champions easily. It also acts as a counter to wear which have dashes and rely on kitting to win fights. Its e allows it to get out of sticky situations with ease."}
{"text": "As gwen, If they invade you early, just back off. This is especially true if they are ahead, as you will not win early fights with them.\n\nBe proactive with your Ultimate. Force ganks with your R!\n\nAs they will be ganking often in the early game, you need to make sure that you are also looking to gank as often as you can and abuse your E.\n\nFocus on securing those objectives. You must take Rift Heralds and Drakes whenever you can!\n"}
{"text": "As taliyah, Just look to choose enemies with your abilities when possible. It will help make team fighting really unfair for the enemy team. Try to shoot enemies before all-in'ing. You may need to get the Blue Buff to make sure you have enough mana to maintain spamming ability. Use your ultimate R to choose enemies when possible. It would be a remarkable ability to use when you see an enemy on a side track."}
{"text": "As janna, Look to harass the enemy as often as possible in early play. This will allow you to get your search for support element done quite quickly. Your main goal in the track should be to peel and protect your ADC as much as possible. If you or they fall behind, it will be harder for you to win the track and play. Keep an eye on your positioning in the track. Try to adjust your positioning accordingly and play around where your ADC is standing at any time. If you are too far back, they will fight for the farm and you will have no priority in the way."}
{"text": "Against anivia, Whenever Anivia has her Passive up, her ability to survive all-ins is much higher. Try to look for frequent trades while her Egg is down, and call for assistance when needed.\n\nOnce Anvia has some levels behind her, her strength increases dramatically. Respect her burst and all-in potential whenever her t is available.\n\nPost 6, Anivia can quickly push the minion wave with her m. Once she has access to her Ultimate m, she will constantly push you into your tower. Keep this in mind and try to prevent her from doing so."}
{"text": "Against taric, Avoid putting yourself in choking points to make it harder for Taric to land his E. Stand in the middle of the way and away from the walls to give you more room to maneuver and avoid the spell. If Taric activates his Ultimate R during a skirmish, you have two options to take. You can either try to blow him up and kill him or his ADC before they get protection, or you can disengage and wait for him to disappear before fighting again."}
{"text": "As milio, Poke with your Q as much as you can, but focus on harassing with cars as much as you can. If you miss your Q, the enemy will kill you.

{"text": "Against gwen, When fighting Gwen alone, try and only commit to fights when she doesn\u2019t have many stacks otherwise she will deal a lot of damage to you.\n\nGwen is a skirmish heavy Jungler in the early game. If she ganks a lane and you cannot contest it, try and invade her jungle on the opposite side of the map or gank another lane to equal her pressure.\n\nGwen has very good objective control and can solo the Dragon and Rift Herald frequently. Place vision to spot her before she is able to take these objectives alone."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Constantly adapt your positioning in lane so Ornn is unable to knock you up with his E. Stand away from walls and his Pillar Q so he is unable to CC.\n\nRefrain from using any major CC abilities on Ornn when his W is off cooldown as he can use it to dodge or escape CC.\n\nOnce Ornn hits level 6, his kill pressure in lane will increase and he may start getting ganks from his Jungler. Get vision in the river so you can spot the Jungler early."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Ornn has the ability to knock up enemies that are close to his Q, terrain and walls. Avoid fighting inside the jungle as it will allow him to land an easy knockup.\n\nIn team fights, avoid grouping too closely as Ornn can use his Ultimate R to get a multi-person knock up and start the team fight.\n\nAvoid fighting in the jungle as teams will be quite close together which allows him to knockup multiple champions at once."}
{"text": "As sivir, Several points in her Ultimate R will simply allow her to help her team choose out-of-target targets. Apart from that, she can also use it defensively. Her mid-game potential is strong enough because she can secure choices and win mid-priority when possible. This translates into neutral goals. Her first capacity will be maximized at level 9, which will allow her to do a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As shen, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Stay with your team at the end of the game. Don't separate or stay away from them; otherwise, the enemy can try to take you or launch a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus on the only rear line, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "As kled, Kled needs some time to come online. Play safe in the very early game unless you have a favourable matchup. \n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can look for aggressive plays and extended trades. \n\nAt level 6 your kill pressure increases and so does your all-in. Wait for the enemy to overextend before initiating a trade with your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, If you're strong at level 6, try to abuse it. After she's finished her first article, Taliyah can quickly push the wave with her Q. Make sure you're still behind the minion wave or outside of it so she can't push and poke at the same time. The more items she gets the strongest Taliyah will be.

If you walk too far forward, the enemy will focus you and take you down.\n\nContinue to kite in team fights and consistently adapt your positioning. Avoid standing still in fights as you\u2019ll be an easy target.\n"}
{"text": "As irelia, If you can get a kill or get a health advance early, you will have an easier time during the laning phase. Once you are level 6, play aggressive and look for a murder. You should try to get them low before committing to the all-in, but it should be the simple veil. Remember that your Q will reset if you use it on a weak health minion. Keep a constant eye on the minion wave and look for these aggressive games."}
{"text": "As sivir, Her first game is decent because she can get up quickly enough and inflict a lot of damage with her Q. Level 6 is a massive peak because it now allows her team to collapse on targets. It also allows her to escape threats. The first element will allow Sivir to inflict more damage and maintain the priority of the track by pushing the wave infrequently."}
{"text": "As nami, During this phase of the game, Nami will have several elements to allow him to protect his team. Combined with his W, his allies will be quite healthy during the game. A maximum of Ultimate R will allow him to use the ability quite frequently and to deposit a lot of damage at the same time. It will be great during the enlighted fights. She is remarkable in the fights at the end of the game due to her overall utility and CC on her Q. That CC can easily be chained with her Ultimate R for maximum efficiency."}
{"text": "As morgana, Her Q can be blocked by minions. If the enemy is positioning well throughout the laning phase, it will be very hard for you to land this ability.\n\nMisuse of her E can lead her to many nasty situations which are potentially lethal for her. This is especially true if her opponent has some form of hard CC.\n\nMissing her Q can give her enemies a long time window to harass her freely. That ability is quite easy to dodge if she tries to land it from vision or from maximum range."}

If you start to split push, the enemy will force a fight and kill your team while you\u2019re gone.\n\nDelay team fights while you wait for your Ultimate m to come back up. Do not team fight unless your Ultimate m is up. Additionally, waiting for your Zhonya\u2019s Hourglass to come up would be beneficial too.\n\nIf the enemy has lots of disengage or poke, continue to flank in team fights to ensure you get on to the enemy before they\u2019re able to disengage or poke you down."}
{"text": "Against tahmkench, It offers it an extra pressure to kill. Keep this in mind when the snail post 6. Tahm's early game is rather weak. Try and abuse it to get an early lead. The more the game goes, the stronger and tankier Tahm Kench will become. Put it behind in the early game to reduce its power in the late game."}
{"text": "As kindred, If Kindred has more than 8 stacks at this point, she will just crush everyone and proceed to destroy the Nexus soon. She will just need to keep an eye out for her positioning.\n\nAt level 16, her Ultimate R will be maxed out. This means that she can use it more frequently, allowing her to turn the tide of significant team fights and objective fights.\n\nKindred will have multiple items now, which allows her to deal a lot of damage. Combined with the number of marks she has, this damage will be the victory deciding factor in the game."}

This way, no one can attempt a surprise steal.\n\nYour Ultimate l will be extremely useful during team fights. Just make sure that you use it to zone off the enemy backline from the frontline. This way, you will gain a massive advantage during team fights.        "}

Your champion is really good at blowing somebody up, so try your hardest to increase your lead by getting picks.\n\nIn team fights, look to flank and blow up the squishiest enemies. Attacking from the side rather than running directly at the enemy will be your go-to plan in team fights.\n\nFocus on securing objectives like the Dragon and Baron in the mid game. As you\u2019re the Jungler, make sure you make the call for the objective when necessary."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Her first major power spike is at level 6 as she gets access to her Ultimate R. She will be really strong at this stage of the game.\n\nOnce she has completed her first component item, her trading ability heavily increases.

{"text": "Against akshan, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make its all-in less effective. Post 6, try to interrupt or in some way or force Akshan to top its Ultimate. This will increase your survival and it will be put on a short cooldown. Keep in mind that the early armor will be very beneficial in this matchup. Akshan is an AD champion, so picking up the early armor will protect you from some of its damage."}
{"text": "As vayne, Vayne will have the range advantage in the lane in most matchups. She will be able to abuse the enemy and deny them from the farm.\n\nVayne scales incredibly well into the later parts of the game.

{"text": "As morgana, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As leesin, If Lee Sin is late in the game, it will fight in the later parts of the game. Lee Sin is vulnerable to hard engagement and CC. If the enemy has a lot of CC, you will need to play around their CC tools if you want to perform cool maneuvers with your Ultimate k. It fights in the way when it plays against champions with good counter-engagement, short cooldowns and range: especially if they know how to handle minion waves."}
{"text": "Against sion, If one's level 1 and 2 is strong enough if he tries to cheese the way. If he didn't go to cheese, then he didn't win to be very early.

{"text": "As taliyah, Extremely squishy and can be killed if some form of crowd control lands on her. This is especially true during the early game.\n\nHer Ultimate R has the probability of getting her entire team killed if used improperly. She is also very vulnerable when her C is down.\n\nThe worked ground mechanic on her Q can easily allow her laners to play in the middle of the lane as she can keep barraging her enemies with continuous Qs."}
{"text": "Against blitzcrank, If Blitzcrank ever misses his b in a team fight, make sure you focus him down and kill him while he\u2019s out of position. He is quite vulnerable to CC and if you can lock him down, he\u2019s an easy target.\n\nBlitzcrank is rather squishy and immobile. Catch him out of position and ambush him when he goes alone to ward objectives like the Baron or Dragon.\n\nIf Blitzcrank is nowhere to be seen, he might be on the flank your team and trying to get a good Hook b.

You have to be very careful when trying to use it otherwise the enemy will cancel its channel.\n\nVersus poke or champions with a lot of wave clear, it is going to be near impossible for you to roam and help your allies as the enemy will keep you pushed in or take your tower while you\u2019re roaming.\n"}
{"text": "As drmundo, If you reach the late game like Dr. Mundo, you should have brought a ton of tank and defensive items. At this stage of the game, you will be very, very tanky and quite unqualified. Look for aggressive fights with your team to win a win. At level 16, Mundo will put the third point in his Ultimate R. The regeneration that he gets from this peak of power will be incredibly powerful. Even if the enemy picks up items of healing reduction, he will gain another ton of health. As Dr. Mundo is a tank, he will be good in the late parts of the game because he can stick to the enemy rear line and force them to concentrate it rather than his portages. Due to this style of play, he should be a major threat in the fights of the late game team."}
{"text": "As lulu, This champion is quite motionless and is subject to CC. If they get caught by any CC, they will probably die. Lulu relies on her team to carry while she provides them with healings and shields. Lulu is a squishy champion with low points of success. This makes her rather vulnerable and easy to kill."}
{"text": "Against teemo, At level 6, Teemo\u2019s pressure increases thanks to his Ultimate t giving him extra damage and the ability to place Mushrooms t all around the map. \n\nThe more ability haste Teemo buys, the more Shrooms t he can place around on the map. Try to take unorthodox pathing to prevent walking through them.\n\nNashor\u2019s Tooth is a core item for Teemo. It gives him lots of additional stats- which makes him more of a threat."}

Crowd control is his mortal enemy, and he can be taken out quite easily due to his squishiness.\n\nHis Ultimate R doesn\u2019t have a lot of width, which makes it really easy for the enemies to dodge it from range. This will require Yone to get close to the enemy team, which can put him in a vulnerable position."}

It\u2019s important that you do not fall behind in CS and XP by staying mid when there are lots of other champions there."}
{"text": "As gragas, Level 3 is a massive powerspike for Gragas as he can now look for full-blown all-ins on the enemy target. Positioning may cause some hindrance as his E can be interrupted by minions. Using the lane brushes or his Flash should quickly solve the problem.\n\nGragas' level 6 is a significant power spike because he can now displace key enemy targets during a gank or all-in. It can let him pick off the enemy backline should he decide to go for the full AP build. His main prowess will come during team fights, though, where he can separate the enemy carries and kill them.\n\nGragas' first item will give him a massive damage boost in the lane. However, it honestly depends on the build he is going for as well. If Gragas goes for the tank build, he will be surviving for much longer during team fights due to his first item while dealing reduced damage. Either way, he will be of significant importance to the team."}

This becomes extremely strong from level eleven, and can practically one-shot targets.\n\nDue to his Ultimate k and his item spikes, if he manages to get some kills early on with the help of his Jungler and Support, he will completely take over the game effortlessly."}
{"text": "Against monkeyking, Place the vision around its jungle entrances to make it harder for Wukong to get successful ganks. Wukong has good objective control in the early game. Try to take it before it if possible, or at least keep it kept at any time so you can spot it before it is able to take it for free. Wukong is very strong in a 1v1 fight if it has a lot of health. Avoid fighting it if you notice it when it is very healthy. Especially if it has its Ultimate n available."}

Getting resets on your Ultimate e will increase your chances of winning the fight.\n\nWhen you do team fight, look to peel and focus the closest enemy champion.

During this phase of the game, several articles will allow him to flatten a lot of damage while surviving fights with ease."}
{"text": "Against kayn, Placing the quarters on the walls near the alleys instead of the alleys will be more efficient to spot Kayn as he can use his E to avoid common guard places. Kayn will look for early skirmishes so that he can get his shape as quickly as possible. Expect that he will invade or gank a lot in early play. Due to Kayn, Ultimate R and mobility, make sure to look as you remember, and make sure you are in the middle of the way so that it is easy for you to escape if it comes out nearby."}
{"text": "As ivern, Ivern can easily pick off enemies with his Q. This is done best when Ivern manages to catch an unsuspecting enemy with his Q from the fog of war.\n\nOnce Ivern gets his Ultimate R, he can easily distract critical enemy team members, instigate tower dives, peel for his carries, and take neutral objectives all at once. This will give him a lot of power.\n\nIvern is really good in fights during this stage as he will be full build and will act as secondary support for the team. The allied carries will feel highly safe around Ivern."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Quite still, which can lead him to be camped a lot during the laning phase. Once handed over at the beginning of the game, he was not able to cover much damage. Missing his E, Mordekaiser's opponents, can easily all-in and engage on him. That's because he was not able to move the enemy team, and the carts will be able to him freely. The first grise injuries can reduce his W damage by many. This will help his enemy even out of the duel during the start of the match."}
{"text": "As rell, Group and stay with your team. Go to the hall when you know where the enemy is in order not to be chosen and killed before an objective spawning. Look for choices with your Ultimate R. Rell can quickly force goals or team fights with ease if she can catch someone who walks too far forward. Peel and protect your allies as much as possible in mid-game team fights. If you let them die, it will be difficult for your team to win the fight. After engaging, retreat and peeling for your ADC."}
{"text": "As sylas, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Not falling behind in the mid-game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure you continue to farm!\n\nAs you\u2019re a Jungler, you need to try and secure every Drake during the mid-game. Getting them and securing the Dragon Soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game.\n\nLook for picks with your team. If you can pick someone off, make the call for Baron or Dragon to further your lead."}
{"text": "As tryndamere, Be very careful in this matchup as Trynd can easily all-in and kill you in this matchup early on. The wave is to be frozen near your tower, or you will have to pay for it dearly.\n\nFocusing on farming is going to be really important. Only go for trades on him, when his dash is down, or when he is going to last hit a minion.\n\nHis Ultimate is going to be a major problem in this matchup, so make sure that you save your slow for once he has used his ult, else, your backline will take the bullet.\n\nIf he is roaming, let your teammates know so, and make sure that you don't follow him blindly. One small mistake and he can easily bait you into a fight with his Jungler in the river."}
{"text": "As evelynn, Power farm up until level 6 when you unlock your Ultimate R. Once Evelynn hits level 6 she will become invisible and be able to roam around the map and dodge vision.\n\nOnce your Ultimate R is up, look to assassinate targets who are alone or low. This will increase your chances of snowballing and winning the game.\n\nAvoid fighting in the very early game. You need time to come online, so focus on farming and surviving."}
{"text": "Against shaco, If your team is grouped and you don't have a vision on Shaco, make sure you have a scan and vision lens around you, then you will be alerted if Shaco tries to jump and assassinate a port. Don't hunt Shaco because he can lure you to run in his Boxes x or to his team. Shaco will try to assassinate sketched targets that move around the card alone. You can prevent this by playing as a team and avoiding walking in non-paid areas if you don't know where he was."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Make sure to use your abilities only when you have to, especially your E. Aatrox suffers from long cooldowns and is easily abuseable when they are on cooldown. You will fall into the final stages of the game. Try and finish the game as fast as you can or snowball your lead so that you will be a huge threat in team fights. Aatrox is not an easy champion to learn. He has a unique mechanic on his Q that takes some time to get used to. You will need to put in a lot of practice to master this champion."}
{"text": "As jhin, Take care for his level 6. He has good gank setup and pick off potential when he unlocks his Ultimate.\n\nLet Jhin push towards your side of the map. It is ideal to keep the minion wave here as he lacks a dash and an escape tool, so you can get your Jungler to gank you and kill him.\n\nThe best time to fight Jhin is when he is low on ammo. Wait for him to use his 4th shot on a minion, and then try to fight him.\n\nPlay away from his Support! It will limit how much impact Jhin has in this matchup.\n"}
{"text": "As fiora, At level 16, Fiora will put the third and final point in her Ultimate R. As it will be grouped during this stage of the game, the great cured AOE will be very useful for her and her team. Fiora is very good in the last game and as long as she hasn't fallen behind previously, it should be really good at this stage of the game. A complete construction Fiora is nothing to fuck with. The more articles and the more gold that is trodden in you- the more your chances are to win."}
{"text": "As azir, Azir doesn\u2019t spike at level 11 unlike a lot of champions. Keep this in mind during the mid-game as his Ultimate R may be less impactful compared to other champions on the rift.\n\nAt level 9, Azir will max his r. This is a good power spike for him as he can use it to poke the enemy down from afar. In conjunction with his W, he should be able to poke and farm from afar without dying to the enemy.\n\nWhen Azir completes multiple items, he will be very strong and dish out a lot of damage in a short amount of time. Don\u2019t be afraid to make more aggressive plays when you have an item or two."}
{"text": "As soraka, Soraka is good during team fights due to her W, Q, and E. She will need to watch the flanks, though, as assassins will definitely try to kill her off.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate R will ensure that she can use the ability during any given team fight. Combined with her ability haste, she will be able to heal her team a lot.\n\nHer W will be maxed out and will have a very low cooldown. This means that she will heal her teammates frequently and for massive amounts as long as she has enough health or mana to do so."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Unfortunately, Blitzcrank will be quite immobile in the late game. If he oversteps, uses his b and misses it, he can easily get killed. You\u2019ll need to watch your positioning and not overextend without backup.\n\nThe good thing is your b will be on a lower cooldown in the late game. You\u2019ll be able to look for picks frequently and you\u2019ll also be able to get your second b up after you land or miss your first.\n\nIn the late game, Blitzcrank would be near full build. He should be very tanky and offer his team a lot of utility. Keep in mind that he will still be vulnerable and immobile, but he will be able to soak up more damage."}
{"text": "As viktor, At that time, it will have its first significant enhanced capability. This allows it to gain a lot of team combat pressure, and now it can take regular fights. Another point in its Ultimate m will allow it to flatten a lot of coherent DPS and use the ability quite frequently. At level 9, its will be maximized outside. This will allow it to release waves in a jiffy and inflict tons of damage to the targets affected by it."}
{"text": "As ekko, As Ekko is a champion in the middle, he will be harassed by the top range of other mediums. He must not let them bully down otherwise he will fall into gold and XP. Common flank points can easily be monitored by the enemy team, reducing Ekko's flank potential. Ekko will have to spend some time cleaning the pupils if he wants to succeed in pulling enemy champions. Ekko is subject to CC. If he is hit by CC in layers, it will be difficult for him to inflict damage, use his W or escape combat with his Ultimate W."}
{"text": "Against lucian, Watch out for Lucian\u2019s Q as he will try to line it up so it hits the minion wave and you at the same time.\n\nLucian is very strong in the early game and will look to abuse his strengths to get a lead. Avoid dying to him so he doesn\u2019t get ahead.\n\nWait for Lucian to use his E before initiating a fight or trying to land CC. Whenever his E is down, he is much weaker and will find it harder for him to defend himself."}
{"text": "Against gangplank, In team fights, try to destroy his Barrels E before he can blow them up. This will reduce his AOE damage and his ability to win fights. Try to avoid fighting in areas that are tight as around the goals or in the Dragon that his Ultimate R will hit your entire team. Fight in the tracks rather than in the jungle and make sure you are not grouped closely together. Every time Gangplank has his Ultimate R, ping your team so they know that it can impact skirmishes."}
{"text": "As hwei, Your first power peak is at level 3, where you can access all your basic capabilities. When you touch level 6, you unlock your Ultimate. You can start playing more aggressively with your Ultimate and get your Jungler to gank your track, too. When you get your first component, your damage output will increase, and your chances of winning jobs will increase considerably."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Keep poking the enemy with your d during the early stages of the game. As the game progresses, use the d to create a zone around which you can fight effectively.\n\nTry to roam around as much as possible. Your d > e combo should quickly let you all-in any unsuspecting enemy laner and will allow your allied laner to follow up on the engage.\n\nYour dueling power will increase massively once you get your Ultimate m. Ensure that you use it to peel for your ADC most of the time.        "}
{"text": "Against akshan, Try and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make his all-in less effective.\n\nPost 6, try to interrupt or somehow force Akshan to top his Ultimate. This will increase your survivability and it will be put on a short cooldown.\n\nKeep in mind that early armor will be very beneficial in this matchup. Akshan is an AD champion, so picking up early armor will protect you from some of his damage.\n"}
{"text": "As ksante, Your first power peak is at level 4 where you have 2 points in your **Q**. The next power peak is when you have level 6 as you have access to your Ultimate. Adjust your game during this stage of the game, and work on your wave management. When you get your first component, your damage output will increase and you will be able to exchange more frequently with the enemy."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is a farm heavy champion and will need to soak up many minion waves and jungle camps to be useful throughout the game. \n\nHis Ultimate e deals basically no damage in the early game. This isn\u2019t good for Karthus as he only wishes to use it when the enemy is super low. During this time, the enemy could have already been killed by your ally, and you wouldn\u2019t get an assist.\n\nChannelling your Ultimate e near an enemy champion could be very dangerous as they could interrupt the channel with CC.\n"}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu will naturally want to grow to level 6 for his y. Delay his level 6 peak of power by invading and pushing him out of his jungle as early and as often as possible. Rek-Sai will beat Amumu in any stage of the game in a 1v1, which is more widespread in early play. Don't be afraid to force a fight with Amumu in early play to take early control of the jungle where he is most vulnerable. Rek-Sai has much more clarity than Amumu that allows more time for vision and control of the jungle. This is particularly important because Amumu has linear gank models with only his s to get vision across the river will drastically reduce his gank success. Rek-Sai is much more gank-heavy than Amumu in early play that allows him to put in place huge advantages through repeated ganks on which Amumu can't act reliably. This helps to take control of the jungle so Amumu has a less impact after-6."}
{"text": "As aatrox, When your team doesn't want to fight, divide the push and apply pressure elsewhere on the map. Avoid team fighting during the middle of the game unless you have your Ultimate R Up. When it's on the cooldown, you'll miss a lot of support and damage, so you have to play around with this cooldown of abilities."}
{"text": "As veigar, He can easily start pulling people once he manages to get his first element. Extremely powerful when he fights in closed spaces as he can easily land his e and r on several targets while the crowd controlling them with his n. Very high potential to set up gank with his n. This can allow him to call his Jungler to gank his way and help him get an early lead, which will be pretty devastating for the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Disengage is Master Yi\u2019s worse nightmare. As soon as he activates his Ultimate r and runs towards your team, disengage so he cannot take over the fight.\n\nWhen low, make sure you back away even if Master Yi isn\u2019t there. If he picks up free and easy kills, he will snowball heavy and take over the next team fight.\n\nTry and wait for Master Yi to use his e before locking him down with CC. As he can use his e to dodge skill shots and CC if timed correctly, it\u2019s best to wait for him to use this ability before trying to kill him."}
{"text": "As udyr, Pretty strong duelist during the early game and can 1 v 1 any opponent Jungler with ease. The dueling power increases significantly if he has his Red Buff.\n\nReally good Objective control due to his rapid map movements and camp taking abilities. He can take early Dragons quite easily, especially if the enemy team has no form of vision on it.\n\nHis pick potential during the mid-game is quite massive. He can work with his Support and E to get some free kills and snowball his lead."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Once Neeko hits level 6, her kill pressure intensifies. When fighting her, keep in mind that she can cast her Ultimate R and deal damage and CC you.\n\nWhen Neeko has completed her first item, she will have tons of wave clear and will be able to push the wave very fast. You\u2019ll need to make sure you can push the wave back so you don\u2019t lose your Tower early. \n\nNeeko is good in team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Disengage as soon as you see her channel her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As kalista, Her level 6 is weak in a solo lane, especially against someone with a strong level 6 all-in like Renekton or Darius.\n\nIf she falls behind during the laning phase, she will be pretty much useless in the later parts of the game.\n\nIf the enemy is tanky or has lots of slows or tools to reduce her mobility, she will struggle to kite the enemy.\n"}
{"text": "As seraphine, Your Q will hit like a truck now, and your W will allow you to heal a lot of allies at the same time. Overall, you'll help your team a lot during the fights. Since your Ultimate R will be on a short cooldown, use it as much as you can, and don't fight without. Otherwise, you'll miss a lot of damage and CC to kill enemies. Neutral Goal fights should be your bread and butter. The fights are pretty crowded, and you can easily afflict several targets."}
{"text": "Against fizz, Fizz has good kill pressure at level 3 and 4. Respect his all-in and try to poke him down before he gets the chance to play aggressive. \n\nFizz's Playful / Trickster E allows him to dodge damage and escape from trades. Do not go for all-ins unless he has already used this ability beforehand so you\u2019re guaranteed to hit your abilities on him.\n\nKeep an eye on your XP bar between levels 5 and 6. If you think Fizz is going to hit level 6 first, try to stay at max distance and play safer. When Fizz hits level 6, his kill pressure intensifies and he can easily kill you if you\u2019re level 5 and are overextended."}
{"text": "As riven, This champion is an early game bully. Play aggressive throughout the laning phase to get kills. If you can get a kill or two, you can snowball your lead pretty quickly.\n\nWhenever your Ultimate e is up, you can look for aggressive plays to try and kill the enemy. Your Ultimate e is a great trading tool which makes you much stronger.\n\nKeep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early on. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from ganks. If you keep pushing when you\u2019re not ahead, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you\u2019ll be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lissandra's first element will allow her to break out more effectively. It is very beneficial for her team as she can wander around a large number. Lissandra will get a massive power peak at level 6 due to her ability to chain CC an enemy to forget. It is really useful when it comes to a fast or mobile transport. Putting several points in her Q will make her more powerful. It will allow her to get out quickly and allow her to do a lot of damage to enemy groups."}
{"text": "Against elise, It\u2019s not impossible for Elise to gank at level 2 or 3. In fact, she is very good at it. Be prepared to gank top lane at level 3 and counter her. Remember she doesn\u2019t have much follow up after her initial use of cooldowns.\n\nElise doesn\u2019t spike at level 6 like most champions as she already has access to all of her abilities. Keep this in mind when fighting and ganking. If you\u2019re level 6 power spike is big, make sure you exploit it and gank as often as you can.\n\nElise can be tricky to fight alone unless you can get the jump on her. When initiating a fight, make sure you dodge the Cocoon, otherwise, she will be able to 1v1 you. If she lands it, try and escape as it will be hard for you to win against her."}
{"text": "As lissandra, At level 9, the Lissandra Q will be maximized. This means that it will do tons of damage now, especially in the grouped combats. Lissandra is really good in the team fights. She can easily CC high priority targets and win a team fight alone due to her AoE and Passive abilities. Her Ultimate R at level 11 will provide her with a lot of selection potential. She can use this ability frequently, which means that team fights and choices will be quite frequent."}
{"text": "As chogath, When your team is not regrouping or trying to fight, divide the thrust and close a storm in the side lane. Look for peaks when you are grouped with your team with your m and e. After catching someone, call for Baron. Secure goals like the Dragon or Baron with your Ultimate t. If a major goal is up, stay away from using your Ultimate t to secure the goals. In addition, avoid team fights unless your Ultimate t is up as it inflicts tons of damage."}
{"text": "Against evelynn, Evelynn's beginning game is very weak and it will be the power farming up to level 6 so that it can become invisible and get its Ultimate R. Try to invade its jungle and steal its camps to delay its level 6 peak power. Control Wards place in the river and go to deeper rooms rather than rely on shallow areas. This will help you to spot it before it has the chance to become invisible."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Vulnerable when his W is down as he has no other escape ability left in his kit. The same applies for when he is too pushed up in the lane.\n\nHis Q can be dodged quite easily if the enemy is standing at some distance from him. It is his main form of poke damage, so without it he will be useless.\n\nLevel one Ultimate R does very little damage if the enemy is away from the epicenter of the blast. It cannot be used as an effective finishing move unless Ziggs has items or two points in that ability."}
{"text": "As samira, Care for their level 2 all-in. They can play aggressively at level 2 and gain a significant health lead.\n\nAt level 6, her all-in increases dramatically. Keep your distance to limit her all-in potential.\n\nSimilarly, try and keep the minion wave even or closer to your side of the map. This will reduce her all-in potential and keep you safe.\n\nYour goal early is to keep poking them down. Try to avoid going for extended trades as they will often win those.\n"}
{"text": "As gragas, You will want to make sure that you help your Jungler every chance you get. This is particularly applicable when your Jungler tries to take the Rift Herald or invades the enemy jungle. In a team fight, always try to separate an enemy from their team. Bonus points if the target is still and has no form of escape, as it would be a guaranteed murder. Drive around a lot when possible and try to help your mid-lane out. If you can get an advance, it will be sure that they will come help you sooner or later too."}
{"text": "As urgot, Very high level one due to his rifle knees. He can 100 to 0 any enemy champion running circles around them if they are negligent, and get an early lead. His Ultimate R allows him to be an excellent tank buster during the end-of-game fights. He also acts as an excellent finisher of a wide range, especially on unsuspected enemies. His early play is strong enough that is only increased once he gets his Ultimate R. The strength also increases once he manages to get his first two articles."}
{"text": "As yasuo, You are really good at getting picks and killing isolated targets. Try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Rift Summoners alone. After killing someone, call for a nearby goal. Flanking is your friend during this game. Use your tornado r and the fog of war to get punches on negligent enemies and then kill them quickly. You should be sitting in a side lane during this phase of the game. It allows you to hunt enemies and will allow you to farm effectively and increase the scale."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Renekton is an early game bully. Expect him to play aggressive and go for kills. Once he is level 3, he gets his first major power spike and can easily force a Flash. Expect this and play respectfully.\n\nOnce Renekton is level 6 and unlocks his Ultimate t, he can be really aggressive and kill you. If you\u2019re low, recall and avoid pushing the wave if he\u2019s ahead as he can all-in you while you\u2019re overextended.\n\nAfter Renekton has completed his first item, his kill pressure also increases. Avoid trading or duelling him unless you\u2019re ahead."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, Qiyana\u2019s team fight presence is huge thanks to her Ultimate R. Spread out and do not fight in choke points like in the jungle or under a tower to reduce her usefulness.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, Qiyana will split push. You can use this as an opportunity to engage on her team when she is unable to impact the fight. Keep an eye on her though and be prepared to recall if she is getting close to your tower.\n\nBurst and CC are your best friends in a team fight. As soon as she engages, try to lock her down with CC and burst her down so she is unable to dish out tons of damage and kill your teammates."}
{"text": "As malphite, A fully maxed out Ultimate h will allow Malphite to dish out hefty amounts of burst damage. Enemy squishies will have an obnoxious time in the game.\n\nHe is solid during late-game fights as his d and Ultimate h will hit like a truck now. All he needs to do is wait for the perfect moment.\n\nDepending on which build he goes for, he will either be blowing enemies up all over the map or a reliable front linear for his allies. Regardless, his goal is to get into the enemy backline and separate the front line from the backline."}
{"text": "As renekton, The first element of Renekton will help him massively with his laning. Its duel power should increase quite decently now. Level six is a massive power peak for Renekton as he wins his Ultimate t now. It will allow him to initiate all-in and zone the enemy out in neutral and objective battles. Renekton is a fairly solid champion of the beginning of the game. Its ability to duel enemies and neutral impact objective fights is massive and should allow his team to dominate during the start of the game."}
{"text": "As pantheon, Very vulnerable when his E is down. This can allow the enemy of everything in him and kill him quite easily during the early match. His ultimate positioning R can have him killed if his team does not follow him. Moreover, going too deep without any assistance can also have him killed. Pantheon loses most of the levels 6 all-in against the champions with strong damaging Ultimates. This will make his level 6 peak power much weaker compared to many champions."}
{"text": "As pantheon, His early game ganks are really strong as he has a lot of CC and damage reduction in his kit. He can quite quickly instigate tower dives on low-health enemies.\n\nLevel six is a massive spike due to him being able to get his Ultimate R. This will let him make plays around the map and get his team ahead.\n\nThe first component will let him deal more damage and spam his abilities due to the increased mana.         "}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Fiddlesticks wants to poke and stay safe in the game very early. He's not very strong, so his job is to survive early. Fiddlesticks first power peak is when he reaches level 6. Unlocking his Ultimate R offers him an additional pressure to kill in the way and will allow him to start looking for aggressive parts. After Fiddlesticks finished his first component element, he will be a little stronger and can start to exchange more aggressively with the enemy."}
{"text": "As kalista, The purchase of a Quicksilver Sash will strengthen his position in the game, especially if he is against a team with a lot of CC. This will prevent him from getting chained CC'ed and killing. The amount of power Kalista brings while taking neutral goals is very beneficial for his team. This reduces the enemy team's chances of securing the Dragon or Baron, especially if Kalista's team has managed to win a fight but lost their Jungler. His team fighting style should revolve around staying behind his front line at all times and not getting caught outside. Staying on the middle track and getting priority in this way should help his team immensely, especially when a neutral goal is about to come."}
{"text": "As nasus, Use your Q for poke frequently Nasus in this matchup. This will help you reduce his stacking mechanic and allow you to get him down more easily. When possible, try to engage on Nasus when his W is on the cooldown. This will reduce his ability to slow you down, allowing you to inflict more damage and increase your chances of getting him down. Your ultimate can be a key tool in this matchup. Consider using it to interrupt Nasus's ultimate and disrupt his damage output. This can be a pivotal moment in the fight and help turn him in your favor. Building armor items is important in this matchup. It will help you reduce the amount of damage Nasus can do to you with his physical damage, increasing your chances of surviving and engaging team fighting. This will also allow you to control the pace of the game more easily."}
{"text": "As morgana, Her damage during this phase of the game is immense. She just needs to land her Q, and her W and Ultimate R can do the rest. A maximum of Ultimate R will allow Morgana to frequently use her Ultimate R. This means that she can choose the entire enemy team with well timed Ultimate Rs. Her team fight at the end of the game is on another level."}
{"text": "As rell, To minimize the risk of all-ins, aim to reach level 2 at the same time as Rell. This ensures you have access to your full abilities and reduces her potential to engage aggressively.\n\nCommunicate with your team when Rell goes missing from the lane, as she is a strong roaming champion. Alerting your teammates allows them to play more cautiously and be prepared for potential ganks or plays from Rell in other lanes.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to decrease the chances of being all-inned by Rell and her ADC. This denies them the space they need to engage effectively and provides you with a safer laning position.\n\nTake advantage of your range advantage when trading with Rell, but avoid overextending or becoming too aggressive. While poking her with auto-attacks can be effective, maintain caution to avoid unnecessary risks or potential counter-engagements."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, It's especially true if someone manages to interrupt their Ultimate R, because it's the ability that can turn the tide of a team fight alone. The seriously painful injuries are quite effective against him. He is just as squishy as well as he was not able to do much if the enemy team gets a reduction of healing at the beginning of the game. His greatest weakness is an enemy team that can keep well. This is legitimately going against the Fiddles entirely and preventing him from doing everything the enemy team in a coherent way. The vision will allow the enemy to anticipate his movement and react accordingly."}
{"text": "As maokai, Maokai's level 2 is a decent powerspike as he can now look to all-in the enemy ADC or Support with a potent CC combo. The chances of success increase with the amount of poke Maokai can land on the enemies with his saplings.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike for Maokai as it allows him to get an AoE CC ability which is really beneficial in clumped objective fights. It is most dangerous and effective when used from the fog of war.\n\nBoots are a pretty solid early game purchase as it allows him to roam often and respond to Jungle skirmishes. He is mighty around lane brushes due to the sheer amount of damage that his saplings do."}
{"text": "As akshan, Putting the third and final point in Akshan\u2019s Ultimate at level 16 is really beneficial for him. In the late game, depending on his items, he may be able to dish out tons of damage to a squishy target.\n\nAt level 13, Akshan will max out his E. The additional mobility is very powerful in the later stages of the game.\n\nOnce again, as teams will be grouping in the late game, if he can get the shut down on a marked enemy, he can bring an ally back to life which could turn the tide of the game.\n"}
{"text": "Against xerath, Xerath's goal is to delay the fight of a team as long as possible while he stings with his p and 2. Do not let him do this by engaging as soon as you can. Do not go for goals when Xerath is nearby. He can get you down to the Dragon or Baron, and keep you from sitting his Tours. Taking goals like Dragon, Baron and Towers will be easier when Xerath is nowhere near."}
{"text": "As vladimir, A maximum-out Ultimate e will massively injure the enemy team. Any fight around the bottlenecks will allow Vladimir to win the fight immediately because of its maintenance and damage. Several articles will allow him to inflict more damage to the enemies, especially those who fight together during the team fights. He should be relatively sure as well and heal from a ton of damage. His life flying and damage during the end of the match will make him really good in the team fights. He will just need to use his l and Q at the right time, and he will be unqualified."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan's all-in can be interrupted, but it will be difficult. It is best to try to avoid it and then turn it around. Try to keep the Drake watched so you can see if Jarvan takes. Ping and communicate with your team so that you can counter them and try to kill them or steal the Dragon if possible. Beware of Jarvan's early play pressure. They are much stronger than you and try to make games to get themselves and their teammates before. Jarvan really comes online when they unlocked their Ultimate and hit level 6. Beware that they will start to glove more frequently when they get it."}
{"text": "As viego, Having 2 points in his Ultimate R will allow Viego to kill his targets more easily. This will help him a lot during team fights and skirmishes near objective pits. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will give him a massive boost to his skirmish potential. He will be powerful during fights in choking points. Viego is good in team fights because he can move quickly through his crucial targets E, CC with his W, and win several skills with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against azir, Avoid being too close to Azir-S Soldiers W as he can self-attack you from afar. When he places a Private W, move to a safer position out of his reach. Go for a trade after Azir-S Soldier W has disappeared. It is better to wait for Soldiers W to disappear first before fighting it because his damage performance will be diminished. After level 6 keep a sharp eye on the map and Azir-S mana bar. If you spot the enemy Jungler nearby, step back as Azir could try at Shurima Shuffle and set up his Jungler."}
{"text": "Against hecarim, Hecarim peaks at level 6 as it allows him to unlock his Ultimate t which is a great duel tool that will help him win team fights and 1v1. He is a heavy champion of snowball and can easily move forward just from a murder or two. Try not to feed him or give him kills because he can quickly snowball out of control. When Hecarim completes Trinity Force, his duel power gets intensified."}
{"text": "As zac, The fog of war should be used to catch enemies off-guard whenever you get the chance. This will allow your team to follow up and get easy kills on the enemy, especially around choke points.\n\nKeep roaming and try to get picks with your Jungler. You are extremely good at it, and securing picks should be easy due to the enemy team changing lane assignments frequently.\n\nYou will need to keep your teammates' safety in mind while looking for an all-in. Don't just blatantly all-in the enemy team while your team just dies because of assassins or enemy bruisers.        "}
{"text": "As volibear, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Once Lee Sin reaches level 6, his death pressure increases and it will be much more frightening to play against. Expect him to go for aggressive games. When Lee Sin finished his first component, his damage output will increase considerably. Look at your positioning so it can't easily get you down."}
{"text": "As akshan, Akshan has tons of mobility thanks to his E. He can allow him to move in the way with ease, and go to the enemy to sound quickly. Akshan can bring back his dead allies if he can kill the enemy who killed them. It's great, especially in the last stages of the game where the time of death is long enough. His W allows him to get out of sticky situations and allow him to be camouflaged for a long period of time if he remains close to a wall."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Try and space accordingly to Veigar in team fights. Do not position too far forward as it will allow Veigar to catch you out with his n and start a team fight.\n\nLocking Veigar down with CC will be the best way to deal with him in team fights. He is pretty squishy so if you\u2019re able to get on to him and take him down at the start of the fight, your team will have an easier time winning it.\n\nVeigar will use his Ultimate R to try and take down a low health/defenceless enemy. Buy items that will make it less likely that he can one-shot you with his Ultimate R. Standing as far back as possible will also reduce his chances of using it on you."}
{"text": "As shyvana, In the mid-game, focus on stacking your items and see if you can help your allies in getting kills around the map. It will help your team a lot, especially if you can catch enemies out of the fog of war.\n\nLook for picks during the mid game. It should be quite easy for you due to your a and l. Don't forget to use your Ultimate t frequently.\n\nWhile sieging Baron or Dragon, or whenever you\u2019re pushing the enemy under their tower, look for a pick with your abilities. If you can catch someone out of position or blow them up, you\u2019ll be able to take the objective for free.        "}
{"text": "As swain, Try to go for prolonged automatic attack fights with him that you will win those. But try to reposition so that he can't easily place his Q or E on you. Post 6, when he activates his Ultimate, unless you can kill him quickly, just disengage and wait for that time no longer. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. Swain is easy to kill early if it's too wide."}
{"text": "As shen, Getting level 3 quickly will be of the highest importance to you in this game. Clear the Jungle soon and once you are level 3, start to glove unrelentingly. Try oversized gank of the tracks when possible and make sure you protect the laner that you are gaunting with your W and Q. It will allow you to prevent the enemy snowballing team from playing the game. Your counter-ganks will be really effective, especially once you get your Ultimate R. This also means that you can divide the thrust while you do not clear the Jungle."}
{"text": "As vayne, If the enemy has a lot of CC, it will be difficult for Vayne to do too much because it can easily get arrested by CC. If Vayne falls behind in the beginning of the game, you will find it difficult to do well in the last stages of the game. It is mechanically difficult to play as an error / misstep can get him killed immediately. Control of the crowd is its mortal enemy, and its enemies can get rid of it as soon as it is controlled by the crowd."}
{"text": "Against galio, Avoid regrouping closely in team fighting as this can allow Galio to get a 5 man with his R once one of his allies has engaged. Space between each other for maximum survival from the go. If Galio uses his Ultimate R when you are close to him, you can disturb him with any crowd control capability. This will be very useful as it can prevent him from using his Ultimate R to help his allies."}
{"text": "As kayn, He will quickly get his transformation into early play because he will be constantly steeped with the enemy. Kayn has a good roar and the pressure of the card. He could wander quite quickly with his E and help his other losers. His construction and kit are very versatile. This makes him a valuable choice that he can adapt to many different scenarios and matches."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, His y is a great tool that can allow him to escape ganks and skirmishes with the enemy during the laning phase.\n\nWukong\u2019s Ultimate n is a very good tool. It can be used to help his team win team fights, and for him to get kills during the laning phase. \n\nWukong excels at extended trades with his s and k. He is a very strong duelist in the laning phase.\n"}
{"text": "As tryndamere, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate e is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate e is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "Against rakan, Avoid grouping too closely as it will allow Rakan to get a good Ultimate R off and he may be able to CC your whole team. Play slightly apart when possible.\n\nDo not fight inside the jungle or around objectives when Rakan has his Ultimate R up as your team will be grouped closer together. Remember, being slightly apart will make it harder for him to get a multi-person Ultimate R.\n\nBursting Rakan down as soon as he engages is highly favourable. As soon as he activates his Ultimate R, try to CC him and burst him down so he is unable to get a good engage off."}
{"text": "Against syndra, Watch your flanks and avoid walking on an unclassified territory because Syndra has an excellent configuration with its combo Q and E. Don't let Syndra take you down before a team fight happens. Its goal will be to harass as much as it can before you look for a choice. Get involved as fast as you can so that it can't bring you down. Avoid fighting in the jungle or around an objective as it will facilitate multi-person landing and stunning. Fight in the open air when possible and avoid regrouping too closely."}
{"text": "As quinn, Peel for your carries in late game team fights to increase the chances of your team winning the fight. If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nStick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive.\n"}
{"text": "As hecarim, His movement speed increase on his p can allow him to run enemies down with ease. This is especially applicable to immobile carries who rely on their team to live.\n\nThe h allows him to deal consistent damage while also reducing his cooldown on the ability. This allows him to take extended trades while laning.\n\nHis Ultimate t can be a game-changer in a team fight where the enemy is grouped together. The CC allows him to separate key targets from their team and kill them quickly with his damage.\n"}
{"text": "As lux, Very still and can be killed almost immediately if she is caught without her g. Layered CC will make her absolutely useless. She is somewhat the dependent element, so camping and killing her a lot during the early game will just make her a shield boot during the late match. She can be easily chosen by the enemy team if she wanders too far from her team, or when she tries to take the Blue Buff. She will also be very weak against the complete all-in of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As swain, Very motionless and weak at the beginning of the laning phase. It is especially true if he is confronted with a champion who can all-in and CC him. Is quite vulnerable when his E is down as is his main form of CC. Painful injuries can completely counter his kit at the beginning of the game and also affect his playing environment. He is very weak when his Ultimate R is down as he has won."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Stay together with your team at all times in the middle of the game. If you are alone, you will be an easy target for the enemy team. Play safely and avoid being too cuckolded if you are not in advance. If you are caught in the middle of the game when Baron is standing, the enemy will be able to take it for free. Play aggressive only if your allies are nearby and ready to help you. Stay with your support at all times. As we suggested, it is important that you always be with your support in the middle of the game or you will be an easy target."}
{"text": "As vex, Once Vex reaches level 3 and gets access to each of its capabilities, it could look to play aggressively and make a coin. Unlocking Vex-S Ultimate R at level 6 is a precious power peak for it. Expecting it to play more aggressively when its Ultimate R is on cooldown. Winning enough gold for its first component element offers its additional trading potential in the track. Its damage output will increase and it will be stronger after that."}
{"text": "As neeko, Level six is an important peak for Neeko as it gains access to its Ultimate R power. Team fighting will become really easy now. The first component will allow it to spam capabilities and not miss mana. It will also allow it to do a lot of damage in the way. Once the guard search is complete, Neeko can start putting in place a vision around the map."}
{"text": "As vi, Vi's pick potential will still be preserved during this stage of the game. She should be able to get into the backline and lockdown high-priority targets with ease as well.\n\nShe will now have three points in her Ultimate R. This means that Vi can easily use the ability to lock down enemies in a frequent fashion. Any squishy enemy target will have a hard time playing the game.\n\nThis is the point of the game where Vi starts to fall off. This means that she will have to focus on peeling for her carries or acting as an engager when possible."}
{"text": "As gragas, Beware of the early invasion potential of Gragas. They can invade you often, so you have to be ready. Be careful what happens on the map at all times. Ward for your allies! Gragas is a great ganker, and you can decrease their early power by guiding your allies, so they don't die for ganks. Your Ultimate is strong, so you have to abuse him to win an advance on Gragas. They will beganking often, so you have to do so too. A good Gragas will use their Ultime whenever he is to gank an ally. Make sure to gank as much as possible, as well as you can apply as much pressure as they can."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar has great pick potential with his Ultimate R Picking off one champion could win you the game!\n\nMalzahar has a shield that will protect him against incoming damage. This increases your survivability in lane.\n\nHe can single-handed win a team fight if he can pick off a key target with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Her lack of escape tool makes her vulnerable to ganks, all-in and a lot of damage. This makes her more difficult to survive in the way. He relies heavily on her mana pool in early play to inflict damage. Although she can self-attack for an extra poke. This champion is quite motionless and is subject to CC. If they get caught by a CC, they will probably die. In particular, when she channels her Ultimate e she is vulnerable."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Tryndamere is good at level 6 as his Ultimate e offers him additional protection in skirmishes.\n\nHe is a good split pusher in the mid and late game. Make sure someone contests his push throughout all stages of the game.\n\nAt level 9, Tryndamere would\u2019ve maxed his first ability. His skirmishing power at this stage will be much stronger and it will be deadly to fight him alone."}
{"text": "Against camille, Try to stand in the middle of the way at all times. This will make it harder for her to land her E in a trade. Do not approach the walls because it will give her the opening to engage. If you play like a varied champion, try to harass Camille with basic attacks every time she tries to hit last. Camille lacks support in the game early, so you can get her out of the way easily if you continue the automatic attack. If Camille uses her E in the way, she will be vulnerable while he is about to cool."}
{"text": "As nunu, Very good objective control because of his Q and Smite. It also allows him to heal both in the way and in the Jungle, which gives him an innate advantage against other Junglers. Great potential for glove because of his W, especially if there is no vision set up by the enemy team. This can lead to a large CC chain. Its Ultimate R can allow him to set phenomenal death brushes while contesting objectives. This can allow him to put an end to the game or take the goal quite freely."}
{"text": "As lulu, Lulu can keep his allies alive for a long time with his E and Ultimate R in team fighting. This increases his ability to inflict damage and survive team fighting. You have a lot of poke thanks to your Q and E. This can allow you to win 1v1 battles with the enemy. You can also use your E to protect yourself rather than use it on the enemy. To tons of utility that can help him in a plethora of scenarios. Lulu is a solid choice and can fit into many team compositions."}
{"text": "Against illaoi, Test of Spirit E is essential when it comes to trading. Dodging this ability is key as it will reduce her trading power. Ensure that you\u2019re always stood behind at least 1 minion. Do not stand inside the minion wave though as Illaoi can use her Q to push the wave and poke you at the same time if you stand in it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been hit by her E and escaped the zone, don\u2019t kill all the Tentacles. Stand next to one of them so another one cannot spawn.\n \nTry and freeze the wave closer to your side of the map. Illaoi is weak early on and will try to freeze the wave and then zone you away from minions when she is stronger. By keeping the wave closer, you\u2019ll limit her ability to farm and scale."}
{"text": "As garen, Play safe in the first few levels. Garen needs some time to come online or else he\u2019ll fall behind and be unable to scale.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve unlocked your Ultimate R, you can look to play more aggressive. Your Ultimate R can be seen as an execute and will help you finish off the enemy.\n\nOnce you have a few levels or an item under your belt, you can look to play more aggressive and look for fights."}
{"text": "Against renata, When she reaches level 6, she can set up her Jungler to inflate your way and kill you. Keep this in mind post 6. She is good in team fights thanks to the great ray on her Ultimate R. Once she has finished her Mythic article, her utility, peeling and trading potential increases sharply."}
{"text": "As lucian, His first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give him a massive damage boost and will let him take over the mid-game easily.\n\nLucian is excellent during the mid-game as this is the time where he is the most powerful. He can now go to a side lane and split push due to his Passive and basic abilities. This is also why his abilities will hit like a truck, and he will frequently kill enemies.\n\nAt level 11, Lucian will be able to get his stage 2 Ultimate R. It can help him massively during neutral, objective fights and duels due to the amount of damage it dishes out.        "}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As azir, Just like in the mid-game, Azir doesn\u2019t spike at level 16 either. While an extra point in his Ultimate R will come in handy, it is not going to make or break him.\n\nAt level 13, Azir will max out both his W and his r. He should be a real terror at this stage of the game and he will be able to dish out a lot of damage in a short amount of time.\n\nPaired with his level 13 power spike and picking up more and more items, Azir\u2019s late game is very strong."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Try to abuse your range advantage to get an early health advance. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early to force them to lie down for the farm and XP. When you try to poke, target your abilities so they hit the minion wave and the enemy at the same time. Once they are level 6, they get stronger than you and it will be harder for you to run against them."}
{"text": "As chogath, Cho\u2019Gath can easily get kited by ADCs and champions with dashes in team fights. This makes it hard for him to catch out mobile champions.\n\nIf Cho\u2019Gath decides to use his Ultimate t on a minion, he has to wait a long time for it to come back up. When it\u2019s on cooldown as well, he misses out on a lot of potential true damage.\n\nCho\u2019Gath is quite weak in lane depending on the matchup he is in. He is really weak against champions with strong early games."}
{"text": "Against orianna, Orianna isn\u2019t the strongest laner, but she does have a lot of poke early on thanks to her d and d.\n\nOnce Orianna hits level 6, her kill pressure and survivability increases. At this time, she will be more lane dominant.\n\nTeam fights are really where Orianna shines as her Ultimate d is a large AOE ability that can turn the tide of the team fight. Always keep an eye on who her Ball d is attached too and try and stay as far away from it as possible."}
{"text": "As sion, An additional point in his Ultimate R will boost his overall damage and let him use the ability frequently. It will help him massively during team fights or when trying to secure picks.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level nine. This increases his damage, and his team fighting potential will be pretty respectable now. He will pose a lot of threats if he can use the ability while hiding in a brush.\n\nHis tankiness will be colossal during this phase of the game. He will soak up both tower shots and enemy damage simultaneously and make it very easy for his allies to follow up on his engagement.        "}
{"text": "Against nunu, Roaming the Nunus can be really difficult to manage. Ping as soon as he disappears as he will seek to help his allies.

Nunu can be really good in team fighting in the middle of the game if he is able to choose someone with his W."}
{"text": "As rammus, Rammus is a very weak game. It has an unhealthy first clear and cannot fight the enemy Jungler if it is invaded. Avoid fighting in a 1v1 at the beginning of the game. Relys on his allies to follow when he ganks. As it lacks damage and is a tank, it cannot do so much and rely on his allies to extinguish the damage. Unfortunately, as we discussed, Rammus lacks damage. This means that if his allies are behind, the probability of winning battles will be reduced. While you will be tanky, these tanky stats will mean nothing if your team really quickly dies."}
{"text": "Against jayce, Jayce will try and delay a team fight for as long as possible so he can poke with his s and w combo. Do not delay team fights at all costs so he is unable to poke you down.\n\nDon\u2019t try to take objectives like the Baron or Dragon when Jayce is nearby. As your team will be grouped closely together, he will be able to land devastating blows with his s and this could cost you your team the objective and your lives. \n\nIf Jayce is in a side lane split pushing, make sure you keep an eye on his positioning at all times. He can quickly clear waves and takedown towers with his d. Do not leave him uncontested for too long. "}
{"text": "As taliyah, Just look to pick off enemies with your abilities when possible. It will help make team fights really unfair for the enemy team.\n\nTry to poke enemies out before all-in'ing them.

This would be a remarkable ability to use when you see an enemy on a side lane."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, His E allows him to CC key targets but has a long cooldown early on. Fortunately, he will not have this problem during the late game and will now take down many enemies with his E.\n\nAdding another point to his Ultimate R will give his empowerments more overall strength. It can be convenient when taking neutral objectives and fighting enemies who rely on diving and locking Heimerdinger down.\n\nHeimerdinger will have many items now, and his abilities can easily one-shot enemies if they are not careful or if Heimerdinger sets a death brush somewhere. He can also take on the Baron singlehandedly."}
{"text": "Against karma, Karma has her Ultimate a at level 1, so she will be strong enough up to level 6. If you are strong at level 6, you will be stronger than she once you both have reached level 6. Do not isolate yourself at all from the minion wave. Stay behind the minions at any time (but not too close to them because her Q deals AOE damage) so they block the damage. When Karma uses her d, she will be vulnerable to attack."}
{"text": "Against rumble, Its Ultimate b is very strong and will help it masturbate with the enemy Jungler. It can be really good in team fighting if the enemy is grouped closely together and fights in the jungle. When Rumble is finished its first component element, its escarment power and potential 1v1 increase sharply."}
{"text": "Against velkoz, Velakoz's first major power peak is once it reaches level 6 as its Ultimate R offers him tons of pressure to kill. Velakoz is really good in team fighting thanks to the damage of poke and AOE of his abilities. Try to fight when he is not there or when his Ultimate R is down. Once Velakoz has a few points in Q, he will do a lot of damage if he is able to land them regularly."}

{"text": "Against ziggs, Ziggs is quite good in the mid-game and team fights if he is allowed to delay a team fight and poke with his Q. You can prevent this power spike by not allowing him to poke you down and delay a team fight.\n\nHis early game is rather weak but he has consistent poke. Try to abuse him in the early game by looking to play aggressive. \n\nOnce Zigg\u2019s has completed his first item, his poke and wave clear is very strong.

Focus on just farming and poking and harassing the enemy. You're not very early."}
{"text": "As galio, Use the track brushes to hide and trample the enemy with your Q every chance you get. Staying out of the sight will allow you to easily all-in the enemy with your E and W. Since you are a protective champion, you will want to be the first to respond to the fights around the map, especially in the river side bot.

The d shield allows him to mitigate a good amount of poke as well.\n\nHis Ultimate b makes him a menace during team fights. The enemy team can\u2019t afford to fight in closed spaces or they will definitely get chunked out by his Ultimate b.\n\nWith lots of ability haste and reduced cooldowns, he can gank so often and be all over the map. This makes him a formidable Jungler.\n"}
{"text": "Against veigar, The longer the game goes, the stronger Veigar will be thanks to the unlimited stacking with his e. End the game as quickly as you can.\n\nVeigar is rather weak and vulnerable in the early game. You could try to abuse this to set him behind and miss out on stacks.\n\nOnce Veigar has his Ultimate R, his kill pressure increases. Keep in mind that he will deal a lot of extra damage at this time. "}
{"text": "As fiora, Fiora is weak in the very early game. She does need some time and items before coming online. However, she does have a lot of all-in pressure.\n\nHer first major power spike is when she gets her first item. It offers her additional kill pressure in lane and will allow her to get a lead.\n\nAt level 6, Fiora will unlock her Ultimate R. Her kill pressure will again intensify and she will be able to look for riskier all-ins thanks to the heal that it provides."}
{"text": "As kaisa, She can be both a destroyer of tanks, as well as a decimator of squishier champions depending on the construction she chooses. She is very strong when she fights in a 1 v 1 without minions around. That's because her Q can all target the same champion and do a lot of damage in a short time. Her E and Ultimate R allows her to be independent in the way, while her Support wanders around to get kills or aids. Her Ultimate R can be used as a way to catch up and finish the opponents as well, especially after they Flash or detach from her."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin will be trying to gank as much as he can in the early game. Keep this in mind and expect him to be all over the map.\n\nIf you meet Lee Sin in the early game, make sure you dodge his e if possible. If he is able to land it, he will probably outduel you. Try to disengage if he lands his e, or engage if he misses it. \n\nLee can easily secure objectives like the Dragon or Rift Herald on his own. Try and keep those objectives warded when they\u2019re up, or try to take them before he gets a chance."}
{"text": "As sylas, Really good poke and wave clear with his Q. The slow also allows him set ganks for his Jungler and allows him to whittle his laner down.\n\nHis W can allow him to heal a lot of health in dire situations. Being a point and click, it is quite easy to land and can easily change the tide of a fight.\n\nThe initial cast of his E allows him to dash to a certain location. This can allow him to dodge skillshots and also get on an immobile or vulnerable carry."}
{"text": "Against senna, The longer the game goes, the stronger Senna will be in team fights. Try to end the game as quickly as possible so she is unable to be really effective in the mid-game.\n\nShut Senna down as quickly as you can in a team fight. This will reduce her ability to poke you down, deal damage and win the fight. If you can\u2019t shut her down quickly, you might need flank her and attack from the side.\n\nPlay around Senna\u2019s Ultimate R. If she uses it, you have a long cooldown to abuse her and her team.

{"text": "As garen, When no team fights are occurring, split push and draw the enemies attention to you while your team sieges or makes plays on the other side of the map.\n\nLook for picks with your Q and R. Garen deals a surprising amount of damage, so don\u2019t be afraid to move around the map and try to assassinate someone with your team.\n\nGaren is a skirmish heavy laner. When you\u2019re split pushing, look to fight anyone who tries to stop you."}
{"text": "As galio, When no team fight occurs, push and draw enemy attention to you while your team sits or plays on the other side of the map. Keep a constant eye on the map during the middle of the game so you can help your allies with your Ultimate R if necessary. Try and always stay close to your team so you can use your Ultimate R to help them."}
{"text": "As zeri, The early game is quite simple where you will want to make sure that you can land as many loaded shots on the enemy as possible. Always use the track brushes to land your W on the enemy. Working with your support is important in this game. Your W can easily configure your support to make games that can lead to multiple murders for you. Once you get your ultimate R, you should always try to take part in bundled fights. With your E, you can make massive game change games."}
{"text": "As milio, When you reach level 9, you maximize your first ability that is important to you in the laning phase. At level 11 you=ll put your second point in your Ultimate. It will let your Ultimate on a shorter cooldown and you=ll be stronger overall. At level 13, you=ll max your next ability. As the teams will regroup at this stage of the game, you will be extremely useful with level 13 under your belt."}
{"text": "As akali, At level 9, Akali would have maximized his Q. At this stage of the game, she will be able to erase the waves quickly and 1v1 most champions if they try to prevent him from cultivating in a side track. Once Akali reaches level 11, she will have 2 points in her Ultimate. She can look for more aggressive pieces and try to assassinate targets that are isolated or walk on the map by themselves. Since Akali is an Assassin, she should have some articles finished during the middle of the game. If you are able to catch someone who is alone, this could easily give rise to a potential call for the Baron."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble is excellent during late-game fights as his Ultimate b and his basic abilities will all hit like a truck now, especially during team fights.\n\nMaxing out his Ultimate b will reduce the ability's cooldown and allow him to use it frequently. It will be a deciding factor during the objective fights.\n\nRumble will dish out a lot of damage during this phase of the game. His ability to melt through enemy health bars will force his enemies to play defensively."}
{"text": "As yone, At level 6, Yone will unlock his Ultimate R, which will allow him to set up plays with ease for both his Jungler and his team during any stage of the game.\n\nYone will get brief power spikes as he keeps adding points to his Q. This will allow him to go for short burst trades against his laner so that he may all-in them later on.\n\nThe first item component will bring significant improvements to Yone's trading in the lane. Depending on which component he gets, the effects will vary, but it will be good for him regardless.        "}
{"text": "As leona, Leona has an incredibly strong level 2, make sure you hit level 2 first and look for an aggressive play.\n\nStaying healthy is key when playing Leona. If you get poked down, you\u2019ll never be able to engage. When you\u2019re waiting on your cooldowns, play safe and out of auto-attack range.\n\nUse Leona\u2019s strong roaming ability to move around the map and help your allies. Good times to roam are straight from base or when your ADC will be safe and will not die."}
{"text": "As kindred, As you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective.\n\nTry to secure the Baron or Dragon whenever possible. Securing objectives is key as a Jungler during the mid-game.\n\nContinue to farm your jungle as well as gank and help your allies. It\u2019s important that you do not fall behind in gold and XP by just ganking."}
{"text": "As malphite, Its ultimate h maximum-out will allow it to take enemies frequently. It also becomes a reliable source to pick up enemies out due to the short cooling period. Malphite is really good in team fights at the end of the match due to its ability to disrupt enemies and zone them out. It can also set up several combos with his team. Depending on the construction for which it chooses, it will either be a-shot the backline enemy or will be able to absorb a lot of damage during the front lining for his team."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level six is the \"peak of power\" for Teemo. It will let it be extraordinarily heinous and sneaky now, especially as the game progresses. Its ganks will not be powerful enough early that the enemy can easily see it coming during the ganks. It should make sure that it bypasses the vision when possible and runs around with a Sweeper and Control Ward at all times. The first element of the element will increase its overall damage in the game. This will help it in the duels and allow it to use its spells as frequently."}
{"text": "As malphite, Low during the early game, especially against the constant damage of poke that can prevent him from regenerating his passive shield. Before six, he is quite susceptible to poke so that he will be forced to play defensively. He probably did not get any ganks either because he does not have his Ultimate. The appropriate vision control of the enemy team will prevent Malphite from catching the out-of-guard enemy team. This will reduce his efficiency and force him to find other ways to engage on the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against diana, During team fights, Diana's kit offers a lot of burst damage thanks to her Ultimate R. Try to poke her down before she engages to make it really hard for her to engage and kill anybody.\n \nDiana's engage is pretty scripted. Ward to the side when sieging an objective so she cannot surprise your team with an all-in.\n \nDiana is an assassin and can quite easily one-shot any squishy target walking alone through the river. Do not enter the river unless you have it warded or know where Diana is."}
{"text": "Against ekko, Ekkos main source of damage comes from his Passive. Avoid letting him stack his Passive by dodging his Q and standing outside his E range.\n\nEkko will look to set up a W stun by walking out of vision. Be cautious of this and wait a few seconds after he appears again before trading with him.\n\nEkko will look to constantly push the wave with his Q.  Punish him whenever he uses it for waveclear by engaging in trades."}
{"text": "As zed, The first item purchase will make Zed a mortal champion to manage. It should seek to wander other ways and clean kills on low-health / surstaying enemies. Level 3 is a decent power peak because Zed will now have access to its global burst combo. It can quickly go for short exchanges and runes with these abilities. It can spam them quite quickly as well as it is not dependent on the mana. Level 6 is a significant power peak for Zed. That's where it unlocks its full potential and can make games and movements to make enemies wonder what it was. It should also be able to dive low-health enemies and escape unharmed."}
{"text": "As xerath, His r is a clever, who can change the game if he lands on the appropriate target. He also gives Xerath a form of peeling as he does not want enemy champions on his face. His 2 slow can also help him immensely in team fighting. He can set up opportunities for his team to land their control of the crowd on the 2 slow member of the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against cassiopeia, Cassiopeia has a powerful level 2 everything in with its Q and E spam. Make sure to hit level 2 at the same time which is the first wave followed by 1 melee minion on the second wave to reduce its ability to kill you. Cassiopeia has mana problems in the early game. If it is weak on the mana, it could be a good time to fight it because its release of damage will be greatly reduced because it relies heavily on the mana for the trade."}
{"text": "As diana, Stack early magic resitance.\n\nPoke down with q as often as possible.\n\nKeep the wave closer early so you can pick up farm.\n\nPre 6, be prepared to sacrifice some cs for XP so they don\u2019t bully and all-in you.\n"}
{"text": "As seraphine, A maximum-out Ultimate R will help S\u00e9raphine a lot during the team fights. It can dry up a lot of damage, and the CC will allow her team to collapse on the enemy quickly. It should be really great as she will get all her items from here now. She will have to take care of her combat positioning to make sure she is not picked up. All her important items will be completed now, and she will be able to dry a lot of damage in very short jobs. She will also provide a lot of peeling and healing for her teammates."}
{"text": "As vi, Its early-playing Jungle power is a force to count with which it puts a lot of damage in any duel if it manages to land all its abilities. Its W allows it to assemble with ease as well. Very good objective control and to maintain due to its Passive and its damage. Can easily get its team an early dragon advance, after having managed to organize a track with its Q. Its Ultimate R can allow it to target a target down, which has two uses according to its role in the game. Either it can use it to peel someone from its portages, or it can use it to get a high priority porting (such as Vayne for example)."}
{"text": "Against viktor, Avoid fighting around objectives as Viktor has a lot of poke with his y. His Ultimate m also deals AOE damage which will help him in forcing you off the objective.\n\nViktor\u2019s job in team fights is to poke as much as he can before committing to the fight. Try to force a fight as quickly as you can rather than allowing him to poke you down with his y and m.\n\nIn team fights, flank from the side or create different angles of approach to get on to him. This will make it really difficult for him to survive the team fight. "}
{"text": "As janna, Move to the mid lane and either stick with your ADC in the mid lane or hug your Mid laners hand to prevent the enemy from taking the mid lane tier 1.\n\nMake sure you place vision around nearby lanes and objectives. If you can spot the enemy moving around the map, your team may be able to collapse on to them and get a free kill.\n\nAvoid wandering too far away from your allies at any given time. If you get caught out, the enemy may be able to take a nearby objective like Baron, Dragon, a tower or even win a 5v4."}
{"text": "Against lulu, When playing melee champions, do not let Lulu bully you down with auto-attacks. When you\u2019re not looking to engage, stand back so she cant auto-attack you. \n\nWaiting for Lulu to use her E before fighting or poking is a good way of coming out ahead. Try to bait this ability out and then play aggressive while it\u2019s on cooldown.\n\nPost 6 and when Lulu gets her Ultimate R, her survivability increases a lot. Keep in mind that it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to kill her when her Ultimate R is up. Do not commit to the all-in unless it\u2019s down or she\u2019s out of mana."}
{"text": "Against swain, At level 6, Swain\u2019s damage output and survivability increases. You shouldn\u2019t commit to a fight with him unless you can burst him down quickly as his Ultimate R will offer him extra protection and health regeneration.\n\nSwain\u2019s early game is abusable as he is really weak early on. Once the mid-game hits, you\u2019ll have to play more respectable.\n\nHe is really good in team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Bursting him down at the start of the fight will make it difficult for him to deal damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "As viktor, His early game is terrible, and he should avoid fighting for more extended periods during this game phase. Focus on scaling up and farming.\n\nLevel six is a decent power spike as it allows Viktor to develop a decent amount of kill pressure in the lane. It will allow him to impact fights quite easily as well.\n\nThe first item component will give him both mana as well as wave clearing potential. This will prevent the enemy laner from roaming around freely."}
{"text": "As karma, Pre-6, it's stronger, but post-6, your Ultimate makes you stronger in the fights. Try to match its thrust power if you can. You don't really want the minion wave under your turn because Karma has a good poke and will continue to harass you under your turn. Post-6, target your abilities so they grow and poke at the same time."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim is said to be early enough and should focus on getting a massive lead to make sure he can take the game quickly. He will need access to all his abilities and the basic elements to run his enemies down. Playing early play properly is crucial for this goal. Once Hecarim hits level 3, he can start to spoil enemies in a blatant way. Pushed-up enemies should be his main target as they will allow him to get free murders. He should also be able to clean the camps pretty quickly from now on on a response to the ganks quickly. Once Hecarim hits level 6, he can terrorize the enemies with his flanking potential. Hecarim will allow him to completely isolate a target from their team and bring them down with the help of his team. His support will be quite high as well (due to runs and theft of life)."}
{"text": "As gwen, Gwen's had a lot of pressure to kill you, so unless you're in front of level 6, don't bother fighting it as it can damage you to level 6. You're pretty good at the invasion, and as Gwen needs time to come online, try to go for an early invasion. Gwen will look for gank more frequently when their Ultimate is up. Make sure to keep the enemy's jungle entrances so your team can spot the Jungler leaving their jungle with their Ultimate. As you're big at duelling and early, try to make early games around the map to get yourself and your allies before."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand is an incredibly immobile champion. This makes him more of a target for ganks and CC. Brand is also one of the champions who dies the most in the game!\n\nAs Brand is a poke mage, he relies heavily on mana and can run low pretty quickly and he\u2019ll be unable to use his W aggressive if he\u2019s out of mana. You need to always keep an eye on your mana pool at all times.\n\nIn addition to being pretty immobile, Brand is also quite squishy. It\u2019s really important that you do not let the enemy poke you down or land poke as you\u2019ll have to play passively. You will also need to play much safer when your Flash is down."}
{"text": "As skarner, His early game can be pretty good, especially if he's in a favorable matchup. Look at trading and escarmouche with the enemy frequently. At level 6, your trading power is intensifying. You can use your Ultimate in your own way or to help you gank your mid-lane. Once you've got your first item, you can trade strongly with the enemy."}
{"text": "Against udyr, Udyr is a good early game Jungler. Avoid giving him kills to reduce his ability to carry in the mid-game.\n\nTrinity Force is a key item on Udyr. Once he has this item, taking him down alone will be difficult. Team up with a buddy or two to make killing him easier.\n\nUdyr falls of in the late game, but he can still be useful thanks to his E. Avoid overextending if you know Udyr is nearby."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, In the middle of the game, Blitzcrank, b will be on a cooldown a little shorter. This is very beneficial for Blitzcrank as it will allow him to use his b again and again if he misses the first hook b. As the teams will start to regroup during the middle of the game, Blitzcrank Ultimate d will be a very useful tool as it can silence several enemies at once. Silenting the right enemy or several enemies could provide his team with the time needed to dry the damage or reposition. Blitzcrank should have finished one or two articles by this stage of the game. It will be much more tankier that will allow him to absorb a lot of damage for his teammates."}
{"text": "As viktor, Very effective clear wave that also allows it to damage several enemies at the same time. This gives it an innate advantage against various matchups, as well as the priority of the way in general. Can disrupt a whole fight with its d and Ultimate m, so fighting in close spaces is very advantageous for him. It can also pursue a single target with a fantasy foot job, using its r. Its poke damage is heinous and very strong. This can allow him to force his enemy to roll out of the way and then take targets with a numerical advantage."}
{"text": "As syndra, Level 16 is a massive peak for it because it can decimate the squishy enemies. This will allow it to bring down the main enemy teammates. It will have most of its capabilities maximized during this phase of the game. This means that it will be a persistent threat wherever it goes. The enemy will have to invest massively in the magic resistance. Syndra will have many articles during this phase of the game, which will directly result in damage for it. Its ability to deposit a lot of damage will keep the enemy on their toes."}
{"text": "As skarner, His tenacity prevents him from being killed immediately. His strength increases if he actively tries to clean the pupils and to use the lack of vision to spoil the enemies. This is due to the amount of potential to pick that he has in his kit. Can take targets quite easily. This includes empty early grunts and Dragons. Keep them guarded or secure before he can!"}
{"text": "As akali, After Akali has picked up her first component item, the damage output from her Q will increase dramatically. Look to trade more often after your first back.\n\nOnce you have access to all your basic abilities, you can start to trade more effectively with the enemy. At level 3, you can look for more aggressive plays, but don\u2019t over commit to them, so you don\u2019t fall behind.\n\nAt level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as her Ultimate offers her a lot of additional kill pressure. Look for kills with your Ultimate when the enemy overextends."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Avoid grouping tightly together as it will give Malphite a great opportunity to land a 5 person knock up with his Ultimate h.\n\nDo not look for fights in the jungle or around the Dragon or Baron. This is because teams will generally be grouped closely together- which allows him to get a good Ultimate h off. Instead, try to fight in the open in a lane. \n\nPoke and disengage are Malphites biggest threats. If you can, try to poke him down as much as possible before a team fight occurs to make it near impossible for him to engage without dying. Keeping him low will force him to recall."}
{"text": "As kalista, Its passive prevents its automatic attacks from going through if the enemy drops the vision in the fog of war brushes/lane. This can cause Kalista to kill if the two fighting parties are weak in health. Getting CC=d will certainly get her killed because she relies a lot on her mobility to make kite around and win skirmishes. She is squishy, and getting chained CC will lead indefinitely to her death. If she uses her r inappropriately, she can easily miss a chance to score several murders in a short period. It will also give the enemy enough time to all of her if she is nearby, and kill her."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille has a good potential to outplay with her E and Ultimate R. She can often surpass the enemy and turn around or escape the exchanges with ease. She is a difficult champion that is quite fun and rewarding. Players who put a lot of effort to learn it will reap the rewards of a veteran player Camille. As her Ultimate R is a CC tool, using it on a squishy target usually leads to murder."}
{"text": "As ornn, Ornn is quite vulnerable in early play and can be heavily abused if he is against a dominant laner of early play or a varied enemy champion. If you get CC-D or miss your ultimate R timing, you will not be able to hit the enemy. Missing on a ability like this can be devastating in the fights of the late game team. He is weak if his allies are behind. Whatever he does, he needs his team to survive and track the damage on the enemies he took out of position."}
{"text": "As kayle, Another point in her Ultimate R will see that she is the most powerful she can be in the game. She can now cut through the enemy team with a good positioning. Her damage at the end of the game is very high, and she will have to be removed beforehand if the enemy team has a chance to win the game. Her 3rd empowerment is essential and will make Kayle very powerful."}
{"text": "As lulu, Her last game is phenomenal since she can peel for her team for days. No one can get close to her team as long as her W and Ultimate R are in place. Lulu's Ultimate R at level 16 is a strength to count with. It will be difficult for the enemy team to eliminate Lulu's team due to the short cooling period of the ability, and killing Lulu will really be next to impossible. Lulu will be fully built by then in the game. Her shielding potential will be out of the world, and she can allow her entire team if she manages to use her abilities properly."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Cassiopeia runs out of mana incredibly quickly if she spams her E when trading. She needs to keep a constant eye on her mana pool otherwise she will have minimal lane pressure.\n\nCassiopeia is one of the most immobile champions in the game. This makes her a prime target for ganks and teams with good dive potential.\n\nWhen against mobile champions like Talon, Lee Sin, Rengar, it will be really hard for her to land her Q, make use of her W and escape a trade. She struggles against fast-moving enemies."}
{"text": "As jax, He is really weak against single target CC. During a team fight, if he happens to get chain CC\u2019d, he will die before he can achieve something significant.\n\nThe enemy can always react to Jax\u2019s plays and send someone from their team to prevent him from split pushing. They can even kill his entire team and then go for crucial objectives like the Baron.\n\nWeak against champions who are ranged and can kite him out of his e range. This allows the enemy to poke him out and then all-in him once he has been whittled down."}
{"text": "As irelia, Irelia is extremely strong when her Passive is stacked. It is then that she should go for a meaningful fight because he will ensure a massive victory for her as long as she has a target to self-attack. Bonus survival points if she can Q to minions and reset the ability. The first element will help Irelia massively in this way. It will strengthen her duel potential and increase her survival. It will be very beneficial when her Passive is stacked completely. Level 6 is a significant peak of power where Irelia can start to dictate the pace of this track. Her opponent will have to be very careful because Irelia can decimate them with his Ultimate R and Q if they are hit by the initial Ultimate R launch."}
{"text": "As orianna, Try and siege objectives with your team during the mid-game. You have strong poking tools which will allow you to siege objectives with ease. Try to poke the enemy down as much as possible while your team tries to take towers (or the Dragon or Baron).\n\nDelay team fights for as long as possible while you harass the enemy and poke them down with your d and d.\n\nTry to switch to the mid-lane with your ADC and see if you can get mid-priority. It will allow you to get towers and objectives with your team easily.        "}
{"text": "As veigar, Veigar's n will be maximized by level 9, which will allow him to trap the targets more frequently and inflict a heavy amount of damage on them. The track brushes should be used for this purpose. He will have two points in his ultimate R at level 11. This will allow him to detonate the enemies easily as the game progresses. Veigar's base elements will be completed during this stage of the game. This means that any enemy he reaches CC will take a lot of damage in return and could even die if they were weak in health."}
{"text": "As ahri, Ahri is quite vulnerable when her Ultimate is down. Play safer and avoid engaging aggressive games while he's on cooldown. Ahri has several assists that makes her a little bit harder than many champions. Moreover, her hitbox E is not the biggest, so it can be difficult to land. Ahri can be difficult to play in team compositions with heavy CC. Although she has tools to help avoid these abilities, she will be limited to how and when she can use her Ultimate. For example, she may have to wait for the enemy to use their CC tool before using her R aggressively."}
{"text": "As lissandra, Lissandra is really good in team fights as you can flank the enemy from the side with your E.\n\nShe has incredible gank set up throughout the laning phase thanks to her W and her R. This makes her a formidable opponent against squishy champions.\n\nYour wave clear is incredibly strong and you can clear waves fast. You can then use your lane priority to roam with ease."}
{"text": "As rell, Rell's level 11 is a decent powerspike due to her being able to put 2 points in her Ultimate R. She will be able to use the ability to pull off successful all-ins frequently now.\n\nHer pick potential will be really high during this phase of the game. This is especially true if Rell works with her Jungler to set up death brushes in the enemy jungle.\n\nRell's team fight presence will be felt across the board due to her t and Ultimate R. She can quickly get a multi-man stun off using her all-in combo.        "}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, You will naturally push the wave of minions with your Turrets Q. As you push, keep a constant eye on the map. Heimer is vulnerable to ganks if he doesn't have 3 Turrets Q up, so keep this in mind. If the enemy's lantern wanders, don't try to challenge their roam. Instead, push the wave of minions and start winning the gold of the turret plate."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, You should spend a lot of time skirmishing and accumulating a lead during this phase of the game. Your main target is the enemy backline so try to get on them.\n\nFlanks and the fog of war are your friends in this game. Always try to use the fog of war to get to the enemy backline and allow your allies to follow up on your engage.\n\nFighting around choke points will be really helpful. Make sure that you don't do anything to get picked off and use your Ultimate n to knock up multiple enemies simultaneously.        "}
{"text": "Against vi, At level 6, Vi will get access to her Ultimate R. Whenever this ability is up, her ability to gank increases dramatically. \n\nWhen Vi hit\u2019s level 3/4, she will start to gank thanks to her having access to all her basic abilities. Expect her to start ganking around this time.\n\nAs soon as Vi gets Trinity Force, her damage output and kill pressure increases a lot. Avoid 1v1\u2019s with her unless you have a clear advantage."}
{"text": "Against sett, Sett Level 1 can be difficult to manage. Expect to play aggressively and use Flash to kill you Once Sett is level 6, its ability to get killed in the way also increases. Watch for your positioning and disengagement if it runs towards you post 6 and stay away from your ally laner so it can't slam you in. Sett is good to choose the champions in the middle of the game. Make sure you're never too much before it can try to catch you out of position with its E."}
{"text": "As shaco, You are really good at securing the goals in early play. Look to secure the goals whenever they are. Find a healthy balance between the glove of your allies, the agriculture of your jungle and safety goals. Make sure you don't fall behind in XP trying to gank constantly. Look several times at the gank tracks that are wider or Flashless. Your champion is very good at several times the glove tracks over and over again."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Malphite is at his weakest in the early game. Try to set him behind to delay his next power spike. \n\nOnce Malphite is level 6 and has his **Ultimate**, his kill threat in lane increases and he can start being more aggressive. \n\nTeam fights are where Malphite really shines as his **Ultimate** is an AOE ability and can knock up multiple people."}
{"text": "As akshan, During the average game, make sure you are not ADC'ing regularly. Clean up kills when possible, but don't get too close to the other heavy CC champions, you will definitely get killed. Use your E carefully in this phase of the game. The goal is to make sure that you are never taken out of sight by a skill shot that has the potential of CC you. Your W will come in very practical during this phase of the game. Stay in the backline and keep hitting the enemies until your team all-in. Once the battle is over, go for cleaning kills."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Heimerdinger is good at level 1 if he has 3 Turrets Q down. Whenever he has 3 Towers Q up, he is always going to be a threat.\n \nAt level 6, when Heimerdinger unlocks his Ultimate R, he basically gets 3 new abilities. Take care when trying to fight him as he might just use any one of his abilities to trade with you.\n \nLevel 3, 6, 11, & 16 are Heimerdinger\u2019s major level spikes. Take care when he reaches those spikes as he may look to all-in you."}
{"text": "As leesin, You have a lot of presence during early play. Gank every opportunity you get, especially on pushed enemy targets, to get an advance. Effective compensation is necessary to make sure that you can gank frequently. Don't be a bet when it comes to using your abilities that your energy regenerates quite quickly. Warding will be an essential element of your game style during this game phase. The most important thing you want to do is to keep a Control Ward in your inventory to use your Ultimate k effectively."}
{"text": "As sejuani, Continue to pick up and secure jungle camps whenever possible. Do not fall behind in the middle of the game is crucial as a Jungler, so make sure to continue growing! As you are a Jungler, you must try to secure each Drake during the middle of the game. Get them and secure the Dragon soul for your team will increase your chances of winning the game. Look for choices with your team. If you can choose someone, make the call for Baron or Dragon to continue your lead."}
{"text": "As ryze, Ryze's weakness is quite staggering during the early game, so he should make sure that he plays safely and wards around carefully. The main goal is to scale up first.\n\nHis level six won't be very impactful during this phase of the game as it has a long cooldown, and roaming during this phase would be an issue.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to deal a lot of damage to his enemies and spam his abilities frequently. Still, he should not play too aggressively and just rely on scaling up.        "}
{"text": "As kalista, She can very easily throw an enemy while kitting them easily. All she has to do is avoid getting CC. While she takes goals, her team's chances of losing the objective fight are very low. This is due to Kalistas r combined with her Smit Jungler. In short, she excels in taking goals quickly and safely. She can save her Support with her Ultimate x if they manage to extend in the way. The ultimate can also be used to launch crucial battles, especially when the enemy team is tainted, or fights in closed spaces."}
{"text": "As udyr, Level 11 isn't very strong either because he doesn't get too many stats at that level. It should help him increase his damage and survivability by a decent amount, though.\n\nUdyr is good at securing picks during this phase of the game as he cannot move quickly and CC essential targets. Immobile targets will prove to be easy pickings for him.\n\nHis objective control will still be unparalleled in the game, and he will only get more robust when it comes to this department. He should work with his team to get quick Dragons.        "}
{"text": "As evelynn, Flank in team fights and focus key targets. Taking down the enemy ADC at the start of the fight will make team fighting much safer for your team.\n\nAvoid wandering  too far from your team. While Eve is an assassin and can get picks with her R , if she gets caught out of position and too far away from her team, the enemy will be able to kill you and then take an objective.\n\nLook for picks in the late game. If you can take someone down, you can use the numbers advantage to force a fight or an objective. A good time to look for a pick is when the enemy is clearing camps, side waves or waiting on their allies to group."}
{"text": "As karthus, Adding 2 points into his Ultimate e will cause another significant power spike. His ability to burst down low-health enemies will dramatically increase, causing mayhem in the enemy team.\n\nHis 1 will be maxed out at level 9, which means that he will deal a lot of damage to single targets. It also has AoE properties which will help in clumped fights.\n\nKarthus is really good in team fights as he can slow down multiple enemies and deal a lot of damage to a group of people. This will keep on increasing with his item count.        "}
{"text": "Against jarvaniv, Jarvan can gank at level 2 once he has unlocked his e and d. Be aware of this as he can try to cheese an early gank in the middle or lower track. Jarvan is really good at ganking in the beginning and middle of the game. He will be looking for gank a lot, so it is important that you try to match his pressure of gank and gank as much as you can to prevent him from getting his trailers in advance. He has pretty good Dragon and objective control. Make sure you keep major goals monitored at any time so you can spot him before he secures the goal."}
{"text": "Against zed, As Zed is an Assassin, he will seek to descend targets that walk around the map alone. Avoid crossing the river if it is not monitored. Keep a constant eye on the map and don't put yourself in the same area as Zed if you don't know exactly where it is. Expect Zed to flank and remove squishy targets with his ultimate R. Make sure your flanks are monitored during a goal nap so he can't get the jump on you. During the middle of the game, Zed will often be in a side lane pushed at the slot."}
{"text": "As warwick, Extremely healthy clears early on which allows him to gank overextended lanes quite easily. He can also prioritize taking objectives quickly and starving the enemy Jungler off of farm.\n\nHis E can allow him to take reduced damage in team fights as well as disrupt a fight with the fear on his E. This can allow him to change the tide of a fight quite easily.\n\nHis W can allow him to detect low health enemies on the map. He can then use this information and communicate with his team. This can allow him to take free objectives and secure kills on unsuspecting enemies."}
{"text": "As ziggs, Ziggs is really in good team fights as it will allow him to thoroughly poke his opposition out with his Q. Another thing that he can do is displace enemies with his W to prevent them from reaching the neutral, objective pit. He can even do it from the fog of war for maximal effect.\n\nAt level 9, Ziggs' Q will be maxed out. That ability has a huge hitbox, and he can easily keep poking and sieging the enemy out of the lane. This is quite beneficial in the mid-lane, especially when he is up against a melee matchup.\n\nAt level 11, Ziggs will have two points in an Ultimate R. This will give him a massive boost in his overall burst damage and catch enemies off-guard quite easily. It will also allow him to snipe kills from far away."}
{"text": "As malphite, Level 6 is a significant powerspike for Malphite as it allows him to unlock his true burst damage combo. Once he hits level 6, his roams become more potent, and his presence becomes daunting to the enemy.\n\nMalphite has significantly less pressure pre-6, and he is entirely reliant on the lane brushes to not get poked out in the lane. All he can do is occasionally throw a rock at one of the enemies with his d.\n\nOnce he gets his first item component, he will deal a lot of damage with his d in the lane. This is really vital as the ability can deal a lot of poke damage and make bursting down enemies easily."}
{"text": "As ashe, You are extremely strong during the laning phase due to your long-ranged poke and auto-attacks. This allows you to chip away at your enemy's health bar.\n\nThe amount of utility you bring to a team comp is massive.

{"text": "As kassadin, Group in the late game and stay with your team. If your team is good at team fights, stick with them.\n\nIf your team isn\u2019t ahead or not very strong, you could try to split push and draw the enemies attention while your team sieges an objective elsewhere or does the Baron.\n\nKassadin is very good at getting picks thanks to his Ultimate k. Look for picks in the late game to get your team ahead. Capitalise on the numbers advantage by pushing and taking objectives afterwards."}
{"text": "As akshan, Putting the third and final point in Akshans Ultimate at level 16 is really beneficial to him. In the late part, depending on his articles, he may be able to pay tons of damage to a squishy target. At level 13, Akshan goes max on his E. The extra mobility is very powerful in the later stages of the game. Once again, as the teams regroup in the late part, if he can get the closure on a marked enemy, he can bring back an ally to life that could turn the tide of the game."}
{"text": "As soraka, Soraka is really good in team fights because of her Q and E. The amount of damage and healing she can provide is phenomenal and should allow her team to play without fear in the game. Once Soraka gets 2 points in her Ultimate R, her ability to impact the fights increase overall. She can use the ability quite frequently too, which allows her to save her teammates often. Her W and Q > W combo will provide a lot of healing for her team."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, Shyvana wants to feed the farm into the early game to get level 6 and unlock its Ultimate t and get its transformation. You can delay it by invading or trying to fight it early. Thanks to its Passive, Shyvana will try to secure each Dragon.

Do not split push or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "Against syndra, After Syndras first return, it will have a lot of push power. Make sure you match its damage on the minion wave so it is unable to get early plates and the priority of roam. Syndras E has an incredibly long cooling. If she uses it to trade with and miss, use this chronometer to play aggressive and bring it down. Post 6, if Syndra has a lot of balls on the ground, don't engage in a trade as her ultimate R will inflict a lot of extra damage. Engage in traders when she doesn't have balls on the ground."}
{"text": "As zac, His boots will give him a massive pick-up that allows him to ride easily, and he can turn between the tracks easily. He can also allow him to set traps for the enemy by recalling early and walking towards the path faster than his enemies. Level 2 and level 3 are important power peaks as it allows Zac to strengthen his all-in-one potential. Both levels add a layer to his all-in-one and CC, which will allow his ADC to follow the whole-in-one with ease. Level 6 is another major pickup because it can allow Zac to massively affect team fighting. He will make neutral objective fighting much easier for him."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, If possible, avoid regrouping. Use your strong duel potential in the middle of the game to fight and duel all those who try to prevent you from dividing. Although you are a very strong division pusher in the middle of the game, be ready to team up with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no goals to be taken nearby."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Kayle is at her weakest in the game early. Try to abuse her weakness by playing aggressively and getting murders. Putting her behind in the game early will reduce her ability to continue later in the game. Keeping the minion wave closer to your side of the card will force Kayle to extend for the farm. Once she goes up and tries to hit the last time, you can play aggressive and try the all-in. Once Kayle hits Level 6 and unlocks her Ultimate R, she will also become varied and she will find it easier to hit the last time."}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen gains global map pressure when he unlocks his Ultimate R. Track it and play accordingly as he may influence a gank or fight in a lane once it\u2019s up.\n\nHis ganks post level 3 are quite good when he has unlocked his taunt E.\n\nShen\u2019s pick potential in the mid-game can be quite devastating to play against. Avoid getting picked off or letting him Flash E on to anyone. "}
{"text": "As skarner, Try your best to match their gank pressure early. Vi is a good Jungler early, so gank often. Playing around your Ultimate is really important. Make sure to look at gank whenever your Ultimate is up. You can secure goals much easier than it. Make sure you try to take them whenever possible. Invade and fight the Skarner as often as possible. You are stronger in 1v1s, so try to abuse it."}
{"text": "As kled, Flank in team fights and try to take down the squishiest member of the enemy team. Taking someone down quickly will give you a huge advantage.\n\nWhile the enemy is moving into position and preparing to group, someone may be isolated or alone (or they may be too far forward). Pull the trigger and use your Ultimate R to collapse on them.\n\nLook to group with your team in the late game. Grouping is important as you will not be able to impact team fights if you\u2019re away from them- even with your Ultimate R as it takes some time to get into position."}
{"text": "As soraka, The addition of additional points in her Q will allow Soraka to play very aggressively. Slow and healing are additional benefits that allow Soraka to exchange her health as a regular resource. Level 6 is a massive power peak that she can save each of her Landers with the proper use of it. Appropriate use will require the player Soraka to have a better knowledge of the card in the game. The first element will massively increase the overall utility of Soraka in the way. She will be able to heal systematically due to the increase of AP and Haste Capacity, as well as the added effect of the element she gets."}
{"text": "As viego, You should be a monster during this phase of the game if you have your articles. Participate in team fights actively and always aim at the enemy rear line. Use your E to flank or delimit the enemies of areas like objective pits. If you see the enemy Jungler walking near you, deal with them first. Your Ultimate R will be very important during this phase of the game. It can help you survive situations near death, especially if you target the enemy rear line. Just make sure that you activate your Passive before you die."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Sylas doesn't have the strongest of clears in the early game. You could use this to your advantage by invading him and trying to set him behind.\n\nOnce Sylas hits level 6, he can steal somebodies Ultimate with his Ultimate R. Depending on the Ultimate he steals, his strength at this time will differ.\n\nThe longer the game goes the stronger Sylas will become. Avoid feeding him in the early game to reduce his strength in the mid and late game."}
{"text": "Against corki, Post-level 6, Corki will look to constantly push the minion wave. Try to match his wave clear so he doesn\u2019t keep you pushed in. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll lose priority and tower plates.\n\nDepending on the champion you\u2019re playing, you might never be able to roam around the map and help your allies. As Corki has great wave clear and pushing power, you can\u2019t roam unless he is dead or else he will take your turret down.\n\nStand outside of the minion wave or behind it. This will result in him having to choose between pushing or poking you. Don\u2019t stand in the minion wave as he will be able to push and poke with his b or e."}
{"text": "As talon, Make sure you're close to your team at all times so you can fight quickly. After your bot track has moved to the medium track, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to close and win XP. As you're good at getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambushed and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Rift Summoners alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby goal."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Each point in your t will increase your overall damage in this matchup. It will allow you to force the enemies of the minion wave while giving your ADC enough security for the farm. Level 3 is a massive power peak. You will have access to all your basic capabilities and you will be able to execute the enemies with your poke while making sure that no one can get to you."}
{"text": "As zeri, Be a part of as many fights as you can during this phase of the game. Your Q and W should make life easy for your team.\n\nDo not ignore the terrain aspect of your W. It can come in really handy during situations where you are fighting around choke points.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be game-changing so make sure you have your E ready to escape or dash after casting the ability. It will catch the enemy off-guard."}
{"text": "As teemo, It can wander around the map and place its Ultimate t mushrooms in heavy traffic areas. It will allow it to block enemies by taking neutral, objective combat or fly them with well placed Ultimate ts. Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will allow it to inflict heavy amounts of bursting damage and will allow it to kill its enemies quickly. Squishier enemies will have a difficult time because it will be able to camp these tracks after clearing its Jungle quickly. It is not remarkable in team fighting, so it should either resort to secure peaks and blow people up with its abilities or just split up by pushing until the enemy responds to it."}
{"text": "As camille, Avoid taking too much damage early from auto-attacks. Play around your E cooldown and stay back while it is on cooldown.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 2 or 3, you can play aggressive. Only go in if your ADC can fight though.\n\nTry to play around your Ultimate\u2019s cooldown. Make sure you use it whenever it is up.\n"}
{"text": "As ezreal, This can also allow it to go up to all enemies once they are low enough after taking the Poke Ezreal Dam has to offer. Its Ultimate R has a very short cooldown and can be used freely during early play to wave. This is very useful when it tries to clear the wave quickly in order to get a reminder. Ezreal=\"E allows it to exit sticky situations with ease and makes it one of the safest ADCs in the game. It can also buffer it in response to the CC capabilities that will allow it to avoid following CC if it manages to get the initial CC capability."}
{"text": "Against quinn, Quinn is not the strongest at level 6 as her Ultimate R cannot be used in skirmishes. You could use this to your advantage when trading to get a kill.\n\nHowever, Quinn does have good roam priority post 6 and may push the wave and then roam mid to help her mid-laner. Ping if she does.\n\nWhen Quinn has completed her first component item, she can go for much stronger bursty trades against you. If you\u2019re a weak early game ADC or if she has the item advantage, don\u2019t trade with her."}
{"text": "As corki, Corki is really good in team fights thanks to the AOE poke from his b and Ultimate e. \n\nHe can be good post 6 as he has a lot of poke and wave clear.

Delay the team fights for as long as possible while you harass and bully the enemy down.\n"}
{"text": "As shen, His tankiness knows no bounds during this phase of the game. Killing him will prove an ordeal for the enemy team, and he can frontline for days for his carries.\n\nA maxed-out Ulitmate R should let him use his Ultimate R quite frequently and increase the shield amount. He can split push regularly and still show up to team fights on time.\n\nHe is pretty good in late-game fights and can alter the tide of fights easily. His E will be pretty massive during objective and clumped fights, especially if he can get multiple enemies CC'd with it."}
{"text": "As nasus, Your champion is weak in the early game. Avoid fighting until you have a few levels behind you. Once you have an article and a few levels under your belt, you can look for skirmishes with the enemy. Focus on agriculture and pick up as much farm as possible in the early game. This will make you more than one threat in the later parts of the game."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, Avoid getting hit by her Q in this matchup. You will be taking a lot of damage otherwise which will force you to waste your W.\n\nAlways try to CC her when possible. Once CC'd, she is quite open to all-ins from your end.\n\nDo not go close to her even if you land your Ultimate R on her.

Try to stand far back when you\u2019re not looking to last hit minions otherwise he can attack you for free.        \n\nTry and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. Jayce can zone you away from minions easily if you\u2019ve pushed it into his tower.\n\nIf Jayce lands his s and jumps on you, use your e directly under you. That way if he changes form and jumps on you, he will get knocked up.        \n\nYour level 6 is way stronger than Jayces\u2019. Use this knowledge to your advantage to start playing more aggressive."}
{"text": "As ezreal, At level 6, Ezreal will unlock its Ultimate R. Its Ultimate R is an excellent tool at all stages of the game. It allows it to inflict a considerable amount of damage to anyone on the card. After Ezreal on first return, it will recover its first component. Its release of damage will intensify and it can look for more aggressive parts once it has it. When Ezreal completes its Mythic element, its release of damage will increase again. A good Ezreal will seek to bring down the enemy with his Q before launching a whole."}
{"text": "As naafiri, Look for a good healthy fast clear and then start ganking after you\u2019re level 3 or 4.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate and look for ganks whenever it is up.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to keep good objective control! Gank the bottom lane and then rotate to Drake.\n"}

Make sure you apply as much pressure as you can to match his early ganks."}
{"text": "As nami, By playing Yuumi against Nami, it can be beneficial to keep the wave of minions near your side of the way. This creates opportunities for your gank jungler and potentially secure kills or summons spells of Nami and his ADC. Be aware that at level 6, Nami's death pressure increases considerably, especially if she lands her Aqua Prison (Q). It is crucial to be careful and avoid being caught by his crowd control, as it can lead to your death or that of your ADC. Stand defensively and be ready to detach and use your E (Zoomies) to increase speed to help squander his abilities during the fighting."}
{"text": "Against soraka, Once Soraka hits level 6, her map pressure increases and she can impact the map with her Ultimate R.

Expect her to play slightly more aggressive when she has this item completed.\n\nWhen Soraka has her 3 healing items completed, her healing ability will skyrocket. Make sure your carries have healing reduction items like Executioner\u2019s Calling or Morellonomicon. "}
{"text": "Against volibear, Once Volibear is level 6, avoid staying in the track when it is low because it can use its Ultimate R aggressively and catch you out. If you are forced to remember, do not remember under the tower that its Ultimate R can stop the tricks inflicting damage. Stay at maximum range at all times and step back briefly if it activates its Q. Stay at maximum range when you're not looking to trade it will make laning against it much easier."}
{"text": "Against qiyana, The level 6 power spike for Qiyana is pretty strong because it gives her a game-changing Ultimate R that can be used in plenty of ways. Be careful and do not position near a Tower or wall as she may look to R you into it.\n\nOnce Qiyana has her first item completed, she will look to trade more aggressively as she will have extra cooldown reduction and damage.

Also, you are entitled to some farm in the lane provided your ADC has died or has recalled with the wave at a bad spot.        "}
{"text": "As jinx, His Ultimate R will crush a lot of damage during this phase of the game. He will play a central role in the end fights and kill unsuspected enemies. Jinx's Q will be maximized at level 9, which will greatly increase his damage production and allow him to resume the game with ease. She will just need a good coat of his teammates.

Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Yasuo gets a huge power spike at level 6. He can now focus on poking the enemy with his r tornado and then use his Ultimate R to finish the low health target off. The lane brushes should help significantly when it comes to landing this ability.\n\nYasuo will gain a small spike whenever he puts an additional point in his r. It improves his r poke damage, which allows him to look for all-ins once he hits level 6. Combined with his E, it should enable Yasuo to catch immobile ADCs off-guard with ease.\n\nOnce Yasuo gets his first item component, he will get a significant boost in his dueling potential. This means that he can easily catch up to and kill any over-extended or immobile target. This will be extremely important in the bot lane as it will let him bully the enemy mercilessly."}

If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As zac, Zac has creative gank trails that guard against him a little more. The best way to guard against him is to place pupils on his jungle camps and near his jungle entrances rather than pupils inside the alley bushes. You are really good to counter and glove in general. If you are nearby when the enemy Zac ganks, you should try to help your laner in need. If you are nowhere near, you can either gank another way, move in their jungle or start the Drake. Priorize taking the Dragons early. You can solo the Dragon with ease, or you can ask for help and rotate it after helping the robot. Make sure you make sure all Dragons when possible deny them from the enemy."}
{"text": "As swain, Excellent CC chain if he or someone else on his team manages to CC a target. This works especially well against immobile carries. You can follow up with your E (press it twice) and pull the enemy closer.\n\nCan regenerate a lot of health with his W and hence outsustain his enemies in the lane. His Ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective when fighting in closed spaces.\n\nHe can use his W to set-up ganks for his Jungler as well. This allows him to catch up to his target while also providing vision of the area. The latter part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "Against lillia, Try to break Lillia out as quickly as possible in a team fight so she can't use her Ultimate R to sleep your entire team. Keep an eye on where Lillia moves around the river and sitting goals like the Baron or Dragon because she can use her E to cause brilliant damage to you and your team. Keep in mind that in team fights, her Ultimate R will be able to put enemies who have piled on them to sleep."}
{"text": "As zyra, Keep using your Q and W to farm in this lane. It is really easy to do so while making sure that you take absolutely no damage from the enemy team.\n\nYou're really immobile so make sure you ward up and don't push when you don't know where the enemy Jungler is.\n\nBe a part of neutral objective fights as your AoE burst damage is pretty significant and can easily win you a fight."}
{"text": "As leblanc, LeBlanc should never be involved in direct team fighting unless it is completely pushed into the enemy base. Staying in the fog of the war is very beneficial to her. The search for peaks on the enemy Jungler, Support, or ADC should be her game plan. Taking out one of these targets will easily allow her team to get neutral goals. If the enemy team is CC loaded, Leblanc will have to preserve its power by buying a Zhonya's Hourglass or Banshee's Veil."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, His e can single handedly turn a fight into his favor. The damage is enough to shred through tanks and squishies alike.\n\nHis Ultimate y makes it very hard for the enemy to not take poke damage. This is especially true if Kog\u2019Maw is going for the AP build.\n\nWith proper peel, he can take over a game quite easily due to his Q and e. He also has some amount of self-peel with his e, but it is better for him to maintain his distance from CC."}
{"text": "As nilah, At level 6, it increases considerably. Keep your distance to limit its all-in-one potential. Similarly, try to keep the minion wave even or closer to your side of the map. This will reduce its all-in-one potential and keep you safe. Your goal is to keep them down. Try to avoid going for extended jobs because they will often win these."}
{"text": "As ryze, Another point in his Ultimate R will not do him much good either. This will allow him to turn easily, but apart from that, there is nothing much to that. Ryze will now have his basic items, which means that he will cut down more damage than early play. He still hasn't reached his final form yet, however. Ryze will fight during mid-game fights because his damage will not be enough for the enemies at one stroke. He will have to be careful to get CC'd as well."}
{"text": "As pyke, Multiple points in his Ultimate R will allow him to use it frequently and increase the damage. It will be a tremendous ability during the mid-game.\n\nHe will have his core items by now, which means that he will be dealing a lot of damage in a short time. His burst damage will be devastating.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let him dish out a lot of damage and will completely shut down squishy carries who are out of place.        "}
{"text": "As amumu, Amumu\u2019s early game is non-existent. Focus on power farming and getting as much gold and XP as possible.\n\nYou will run out of mana quickly when clearing the jungle. It is important that you avoid using your r and m too often. Make sure you toggle your r effectively to avoid running out of mana.\n\nTeam fighting can be difficult for Amumu as you\u2019re prone to disengage, poke and CC. Be prepared to flank in team fights to make it easier for you to catch the enemy out of position."}
{"text": "As swain, Once Swain maximizes its Ultimate R, the enemy team will have a lot of trouble trying everything in it. It can zone the enemies out and take care of the immobile enemy champions alone. Its overall damage is really high during the end of the game. This is due to the drop in cooling on its abilities that make it really easy for Swain to all the enemy champions frequently. Swain the fighting ability of Swain's late team is really high. Its kit allows him to afflict several targets at once while ensuring that the enemy rear line cannot follow on their frontliners engage."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Poke the enemy and harass them as much as you can before trying to fight. Bursting someone with some Q.S. and your R will allow you to force a team fight with numbers or health advantage. Avoid using your E aggressively in the end-of-game fights that you will be vulnerable briefly. Use it only aggressively if you are 100% sure you can not be abused for it. Stick with your team and avoid walking too far from them. If you are caught out, your team will lose on a lot of damage in a team fight, and that would be your fault."}
{"text": "As kayn, At level 16, Kayn will have his Ultimate R maxid completely. This will directly strengthen his ability to all enemies and kill them because of his bursting damage. Kayn will now have several objects. It is good for him, depending on his form. He can assassinate people if he goes for the blue shape, while he can act as a front line if he goes for the red shape. Depending on the shape and build, Kayn will be either a murder machine due to his bursting damage or a tanky and non-killable front line that will easily detach for his wagons."}
{"text": "As morgana, During the middle game, you will want to shove the wave in and then work with your teammates to pick off enemies when possible. Your Q should help you a lot with that.\n\nGetting a Zhonya's Hourglass will amplify your all-in potential, and you will be able to dish out humongous amounts of damage without taking much in return.\n\nNeutral Objective fights should be your bread and butter as your Q, W, and Ultimate R will completely shut off paths for the enemies to even get close to the objective pits.

{"text": "As poppy, Its early play is weak because it lacks a reliable range, and its kit is based on the enemy's wrong position in the track. It will have to play it safely and use its Passive widely. Level six is a pretty good tip as it can now disrupt fighting with ability. It can also extend the CC to an enemy if necessary or use it defensively in some cases. The first element will allow it to inflict more damage and to survive easily."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Do not group closely together when sieging an objective or team fighting as it provides Gragas with an opportunity to knock your whole team into his with his Ultimate R.\n \nWhen fighting, make sure you\u2019re not too far forward or split from your team. If you\u2019re too far forward, he could use his Ultimate R to push you into his team. Getting caught out like this could result in the enemy taking an objective shortly afterwards. \n \nTry to constantly poke and harass Gragas. Having him on low health will prevent him from playing or positioning aggressively."}
{"text": "Against trundle, When Trundle activates his Subjugate n, step back immediately. It will become much more tankier and your tanks will be weak. Return to action when his Subjugate n has cooled. Trundle will be divided by pushing a lot in the last stages of the game, try to fight as a team when he is not able to be there. If you spot him isolated and away from his team, try to force a team to fight with his allies. As soon as Trundle engages in a team fight, try to lock him up with CC. Although he is a tank, he is very vulnerable to the hard control of the crowd."}
{"text": "Against annie, Every time Annie has her trick available, you have to respect it and play slightly safer. If you are melee, step back and wait for her to consume it before walking forward. Position Level 6, respect Tibbers R and her trick. Pay attention to the number of batteries on her Passive. You can chat with Annie before getting 2 batteries without being afraid of being amazed. Annie is prone to poke even if her E offers her some protection in the trades."}
{"text": "As jayce, Try to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. This will make it easier for you to grow and they won't be able to zone you away from the farm or get you out of the way. The enemy has the advantage of the range so that they will probably try to self-attack you frequently. Pull yourself out and out of range so they won't be able to attack you automatically for free. Try to constantly adjust your position to reserve health. If they walk forward, step back if you don't want to trade. Be prepared to sacrifice CS for XP. If you are shot down, you will find it difficult to trade or fight the enemy. Don't let them harass you off the track otherwise you will fall behind and you won't be able to kill them. The enem lacks escape and is quite still that you can capitalize on."}
{"text": "As shaco, A maximum-out Ultimate l will confer the benefits of a weaker and greater break-up of the damage of the Shaco clone. It will leave Shaco enemies at one blow if they destroy it while it is nearby. It will do a lot of damage to the enemy team now, especially the squishy targets. It has the potential to a low-shot, still, and squishy targets quickly now. Shaco is pretty decent in team fighting due to its clones and short cooling on its capabilities. It can quickly get rid of critical doors due to its e and set traps for the enemy team using its Ultimate l and x."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Very strong when the enemy is pushed up and a new wave of minions is approaching. This allows him to use his E to catch up his enemy lantern and then hit them with his r. Yasuo can quite easily set up ganks with this tactic as well. Playing around the W can allow him to completely dismantle the various enemy matches. He can run around the windshield and save himself from a lot of damage in this way. Aglaist melee champions, it is always wise to retreat and maintain a certain distance from them. After six, he becomes extremely strong due to his Ultimate R crowd control as well as the penetration of the bonus armor he gets on the use."}
{"text": "As ashe, You should use your range advantage and always go for the front-to-back trades in the fight against the enemy. Always try to self-attack the closest enemy champion to you (while trying to do several enemies) so that you can kite them long enough to get out of their zone of influence. Your Ultimate w can be a game decision maker if you use it properly during this phase of the game. Use it in combination with your y to secure long-term choices for your team. During the objective fights, you can use the same Ultimate w to CC the enemy Jungler, so your Jungler can Smit the goal safely. Try to get mid-priority with your team before taking any kind of goal. You don't want to be in the side tracks unless it's completely pushed into your turn otherwise you'll be taken out easily and get killed immediately. Also, don't forget to buy a form of anti-CC if the enemy team has many champions with their abilities on the hard side."}

He is strong during the fights at the end of the game while his Q and Ultimate R will hit like a truck now. He will have to check the enemy's inventory for a QSS before he decides to do everything in a champion, however. His Q and E will be maximized and will make a lot of consistent DPS during this phase of the game. The Q will allow him to keep the wave in check as well."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille doesn't have the most healthy or the fastest clear. You can use it to your advantage by invading him in early play and flying some of his camps. Early neighborhoods reduce the efficiency of Camilles ganks. In particular, a jungle or river area at level 1 can prevent him from getting a successful level 2 gank. Whenever Camilles Ultimate R is at the top, she will seek to gank a way. You will need to match her pressure by gauntling, against ganking or securing goals on the opposite side of the map."}

This means that Ziggs can easily poke enemies out to make the team fights massively unfair for the enemy.\n\nOnce Ziggs gets three points in his Ultimate R, he will deal massive amounts of damage in a huge area during team and objective fights. Fighting in clumped areas will give a tremendous advantage to Ziggs as well, especially when it comes to Dragon and Baron fights.\n\nZiggs is quite good at taking towers quickly, but as he gets more items, he will completely decimate them with his Passive empowered auto-attacks. After that, he can just chunk the building out with his W, which means that the enemy can't do anything to defend their tower. This is quite beneficial if Ziggs' team is losing and he wants to split push."}

Another reason why it is so good is that he can easily bypass the vision and catch the out-of-guard enemy. Zac will be extremely tanky during this stage, and the enemy team will have a hard time to kill. This also means that he can act as an engager for a team and then come back to peel for his portages once the engagement is over. Once he gets three points in his Ultimate R, he will be able to use it frequently and cause a lot of damage to the enemy team with a boost. He should be able to catch the out-of-guard enemies easily, especially when using the war fog."}
{"text": "As zyra, At level 16, Zyra will put the final point in her Ultimate R. The utility and damage that this ability provides to this rank is very good, and it will be a threat in team fighting.

Don't be afraid to make the call for these goals if your team is able to do so."}
{"text": "As zyra, More often than not, you can turn a gank to the right on its head with the right W location with the use of your Q or E. Use E if the enemy ganker has some form of motion speed with which they can move away quickly. Poking is your main power in the way and it is really heinous during early play. With your poke, you can quite easily zone the enemy landers without even approaching them. Your brush power is unmatched and a rotation of your spells on an unsuspecting enemy will force them to play defensively. Do not try to play too passively and always be on the lookout to land a multi-man E."}

{"text": "Against ryze, Ryze will try to avoid team fighting in the middle of the game because he still needs time to come online. The search for fights as soon as the laning phase is over is favorable. Team fighting in the last game is where Ryze can shine.

Warding your flanks will reduce Ryze's ability to get a good final R and surprise your teammates. Avoid pushing too far forward when you don't know where Ryze is to reduce the chances of catching you with his ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against renata, Don't fight in the jungle because the teams will be regrouped closely. It's better to fight in the open air so that she can't land a 5 person Ultimate R.

Don't forget to collect your chimes regularly. They increase your damage production and you can literally 1 v 1 squishy champions if you collect enough. In addition, your slow AoE self-attack will play a major role during the team fights. During the objective fights, always try CC the enemy Jungler because of them possessing the Smit assignment spell. This will give your Jungler plenty of time to steal the Baron. Another thing you might want to do is use your Ultimate R to cancel reminders on a bunch of enemy targets. This works like a charm when your team has a split pusher."}

Once this ability is lowered, it can be CC=d to forget and get rid of it quite easily. This is especially true if she plunges into the enemy team. Her ultimate R can be easily avoided if the enemy team disengages as soon as she places her final R on a member of her team. During the laning phase, the opponent of Fiora=s can prevent her from proceeding her passive by using the terrain to block the direction in which the Vital appears."}
{"text": "Against akshan, He could drive your team in danger or an ambush. Try to look for fights when Akshan is not there. This way, he won't be able to benefit from his W.

{"text": "Against xinzhao, Unless you have an advantage, don't fight Xin Zhao in the early game. His 1v1 is incredibly strong thanks to his Q and E and he will win most of the skirmishes. To make it harder for Xin Zhao to get successful ganks, make sure you place the vision around his jungle entrances. This will give your allies enough time to retreat and escape before he is able to reach their path. Xin Zhao has good objective control and can take them quite easily. Be sure to keep the Dragon watched at any time so you can spot it before he can take it."}

Chokepoint fights and the search for flanks should be the main goals during the fights. Chokepoints will facilitate your Q landing while flanking will completely disrupt the fights. Do not pee in the enemy team if you have no follow-up of your team. You are an important part of the fight and it is vital that you stay alive, lest you want the enemy team to take over neutral goals."}
{"text": "Against azir, Once Azir has picked up his Nashor's Tooth, he is going to push the wave really quickly. Try to keep the wave as even as possible by matching his damage on the minion wave. If he uses an ability, you\u2019ll need to use one too.\n\nThe best time to fight Azir is when Soldiers W are down. This is because he will lack a lot of damage. Try to start fights whenever he has no Soldiers W available. \n\nAfter Azir hits level 6, he will have a lot more protection and can disengage quite easily thanks to his Ultimate R. While his Ultimate R is down, try to abuse the cooldown and look for kills."}
{"text": "As xerath, Xerath's level 6 is very powerful as he can snipe targets from a long-range in both his or some other lane. The damage output will increase along with items, so it will only make him more powerful.\n\nThe first item purchase will make Xerath extremely obnoxious in the lane. This is because his poke damage will be very high, and the enemy will get chunked out even before they can reach him.\n\nMore points in his p will result in more damage being dealt to enemy targets. Slowing the target with hiss 2 would be optimal to guarantee a p hit on the enemy."}
{"text": "As lucian, Lucian can be aggressive when he reaches level 2. Make sure you hit level 2 at the same time (the first wave followed by 3 minions of melee) so you can trade back if he tries to fight. If he gets the level first, run away. Unfortunately, their level 6 is stronger than yours, so be careful when you fight the position 6. If you can, try to keep the wave a little earlier. It will reduce his chances of all the ins and will also help you pick up CS and XP without it zone you away from the farm. Try to match his poke and auto trades. But, avoid going for prolonged jobs with him as he will usually win those due to his passive."}
{"text": "Against nocturne, Nocturne will play rather safe early because he lacks any real damage until he gets his first item. Try to poke him down and force him to back early so he misses out on gold and experience.\n\nHis level 6 is very strong.

If he activates his Ultimate a and he\u2019s not Ulting a you, push the wave as quickly as you can and take Tower plates. \n\nWhen playing as a ranged AP champion, try and keep your distance as much as possible. If you allow him to get on to you, it will be hard for you to get him off you. Never try to trade autos with him once he is on top of you either as he will always out trade you blow for blow."}

When you push a wave, make sure you have safe points around you to hide and run."}

This will also prevent enemies from escaping quickly.\n\nHer objective control is pretty decent as her E, and Passive allows her to deal and take a lot of damage from neutral objectives. She will most definitely win any Smite fight if she uses her E properly.        "}
{"text": "As briar, At the end of the game, look for choices on immobile or misplaced enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group your team too. In the team fights, continue to focus on the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get the enemy backline up easily. Make sure you are within range to press R."}
{"text": "As quinn, Quinn doesn't have a duelling Ultimate R. This makes her low position level 6 when it comes to all in. She can't fight right 5v5. She will need to flank in team fights.

Mix this with the fact that Quinn is squishy enough, it can be difficult to deal with enemy teams that have a lot of CC."}

He will have to play carefully and wait until he gains access to all his basic abilities before going for all-ins.\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike that allows Kayn to bolster his all-in potential. The added burst damage will be beneficial when it comes to dealing with squishy or ranged targets.\n\nThe first component will give Kayn a massive powerspike as it will bolster both his damage and survivability.

This means that she can a-shot enemies in the last game in a combo."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin should finish the game with this point, as he will now begin to fall. He will always be able to choose enemies, however. Once Lee Sin gets 3 points in his Ultimate k, he will disrupt enemy fighting frequently and act as an asset for his team. Lee Sin will have several elements during this phase of the game. It will allow him to survive longer during his fights and allow him to play the role of the disruptor very effectively."}

Remember, Shaco Support is all about being a nuisance to the enemy.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing as a hard engage champion, ask yourself where Shaco has recently been. If he\u2019s been near the target you wish to collapse on, he may have previously placed a few Boxes x behind the target."}
{"text": "As brand, In the last game, Brand will be close to full construction. This is a significant power peak for the brand as its damage release should be incredibly high. However, it must make sure that it is not caught in the last game or otherwise it has no damage. At level 16, Brand can put the third and final point in its Ultimate R. It will be able to deposit a lot of damage on the enemies grouped in the late game team fights. Note that while you will have a lot of damage, the enemy team should have started building defensive elements to counter your abilities. Try to blow up targets that are squishy or lack defensive statistics."}

This means that he will be dishing out a heavy amount of burst damage and ultimately killing squishy enemies off by himself.\n\nAt level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate k. This will let him use that ability wholly and frequently ruin the ability of enemy divers to get into his backline.        "}

Try to follow the ultimate cooling station of Irelia 6. It is important to do so because you don't want to be caught by the top damage post of Irelia 6. When Irelia leaves the track, try to contact your team so they know they are missing. If you can, try to match their path."}
{"text": "As kled, Make sure that you don't get his regularly by his Q. Force him to use his dash, like that, it will become extremely easy for everything in you. If he goes to the gank track your allies, push hard and get some plates quickly. This will help you a lot in the late match. Kled must be a high priority target during team fighting. Make sure you the CC and work with your team to quickly take Kled down before his team can make room for you. Keep the wave somewhere in the middle of the track. This will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy, and put ganks on them."}
{"text": "Against soraka, Soraka can prevent an all-in by placing her Silence E on herself as soon as you engage. Try to bait the Silence E out before looking for the all-in.\n\nIf you benefit from it, try to get an early Executioner\u2019s Calling. This will reduce her healing ability and increase your kill pressure in lane.\n\nSoraka will be looking to play safe and farm. Exploit this by freezing near your Tower- forcing her to overextend and then all-in her as she walks too far forward."}
{"text": "As gragas, Its Ultimate R can easily be avoided by enemies who have dashes or tools of movement. If the enemy has a good positioning in the track, it will be very difficult for you to engage or use your E in the track. It is because your E can be blocked by minions if the target is not directly behind them."}
{"text": "Against senna, Senna will try to dominate you in the early game. Expect to play aggressively at level 1 to gain a health advantage. Once Senna is level 6, her card pressure and kill pressure increases. Ping once she is level 6 so your team knows she can influence a fight with her Ultimate R. The more the game goes, the stronger Sennas Passive will be. Try to finish it as fast as you can that her late game is strong enough if she was able to stack effectively."}

Utilize this power spike to your advantage in engagements.\n"}
{"text": "As tahmkench, The tenacity of Tahm in this phase of the game will be extremely high. He will be a reliable activator and will be able to easily peel for his team as and when necessary. Level 16 will give Tahm Kench a considerable boost in his damage. He can easily duel enemies, incredibly squishy champions in the side track. Tahm Kench's abilities will have a very short cooling on his abilities. This means that he can easily secure choices on anyone. Poke damage on his Q is just as respectable."}
{"text": "Against milio, Beware of his range if you\u2019re a melee champion as he will look to constantly bully you down with his superior range.\n\nAt level 6, he gains more utility so it can be hard to get kills on the enemy ADC, but his Ultimate is on a long cooldown so you can abuse this to get kills.\n\nIf he uses his Q aggressively and misses it, try to play aggressive while it\u2019s on cooldown as its his main way poking you down. \n"}
{"text": "As missfortune, Stay with your ADC throughout the middle of the game. If you get away from them, they will be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you are still close to at least 1 ally.

Do not divide the thrust or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them."}
{"text": "As anivia, This matchup is easy early, but harder post-6 because Anivia has a lot of clear wave and will just keep pushing you into it. Focus on agriculture and limit the search for fights. If you can, try to target your abilities so they hit it and the minion wave at the same time. This is especially true post 6 when you want to match its clear wave. Due to Passive Anivias, it will be difficult for Hwei to get killed early without the help of your Jungler."}
{"text": "As seraphine, A maximum-out Ultimate R will help S\u00e9raphine a lot during the team fights. It can dry up a lot of damage, and the CC will allow her team to collapse on the enemy quickly. It should be really great as she will get all her items from here now. She will have to take care of her combat positioning to make sure she is not picked up. All her important items will be completed now, and she will be able to dry a lot of damage in very short jobs. She will also provide a lot of peeling and healing for her teammates."}
{"text": "As zyra, As this is a poke game, you have to let Zyra push you in your lap otherwise you will find it hard to survive. Try to match Zyra's thrust power with automatic attack minions and avoid their poke. Try and follow Zyra's Ultimate cooldown post 6. It's important to do this as you don't want to be caught by Zyra's superior post 6 damage. It's very important that you touch Level 2 at the same time as Zyra. If you don't go, step back slightly so they can't all of you as soon as they get the level. Keep an eye on their mana bar and try to fight them after they have used a ability as they can't use it to trade with. Zyra is less than a threat when they have a ability to go down."}
{"text": "As poppy, Can easily be kited by ranged carries even without using their dashes. Her Q can easily be sidestepped as it has a very short range.\n\nCan be killed easily if she overextends with her E.

Several points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take enemies ultimates quickly. They will increase their efficiency overall. He can be very beneficial in team fights."}
{"text": "As hwei, Abuse your range in the early game versus squishy and melee champions.\n\nAt level 6, you should look for fights with your Jungler in either the mid or side lanes.\n\nPlay safe until you\u2019re level 3, where you get access to your primary abilities and can fight far more favourably.\n"}

This will give him a massive damage boost, impacting fights at a much higher level.\n\nOnce Jarvan gets to level 11, he will put two points into his Ultimate m. This will increase the damage of that ability while simultaneously reducing its cooldown. This will allow Jarvan to look for picks more often.\n\nJarvan IV is good in team fights due to his d Passive and his ability to CC multiple enemies at a go with his d > e combo. His Ultimate m will also allow him to single out enemies which need to be dealt with quickly."}

{"text": "As morgana, During the laning phase, focus on poking the enemy down to gain a health advantage. When the enemy is low, commit to an all-in.\n\nLook for picks and favourable trades with your Q. Only use your Q if you\u2019re guaranteed to hit it.

Position yourself behind multiple minions or out of range to minimize the chances of being hit by her poke ability.\n\nAt level 6, Miss Fortune's kill pressure increases significantly due to the power of her ultimate. Be cautious and make sure to play defensively, as she can burst down both you and your ADC if caught in a favorable position.\n\nTo create opportunities for your jungler to gank, try to keep the minion wave closer to your turret. This forces Miss Fortune to overextend if she wants to harass or farm, making her vulnerable to ganks. Coordinate with your jungler and communicate the wave position to increase the chances of a successful gank.\n\nTiming is crucial in lane. Try to reach level 2 at the same time as Miss Fortune to minimize her kill pressure.

{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim's ability to inflict damage will skyrocket during this phase of the game. It will also be quite tanky due to his articles and statistics, which means that it will be a consistent DPS power. Once he gets 3 points in his Ultimate t, no enemy backline will be safe anymore. Therefore, Hecarim should use the fog of the Jungle war to his advantage during the team combat trial. Once his h and W will come out, he will almost be unable to kill while he is mobile and manages to stick to his target. CC is his worst enemy, so some tenacity will help him a lot."}

Constantly harassing him can lead to your demise, so be mindful of the risks involved.\n\nStay aware of Zac's crowd control (CC) ability and avoid detaching from your ADC when he has it available. Being caught by his CC can lead to a dangerous all-in situation. Stay attached for safety during those moments.\n\nBe cautious of Zac's increased kill pressure at level 6. His ultimate ability amplifies his ability to engage and secure kills. Adjust your playstyle accordingly, prioritizing safety and avoiding unnecessary risks.\n\nZac excels at roaming, so it's important to ping and communicate with your team whenever he goes missing from the lane. Use this opportunity to apply pressure and bully his ADC while he's away, making it difficult for the enemy bot lane to trade effectively."}

If Quinn can fight a team, she'll stay in a side track and try to split the thrust. You can either send someone who has TP to prevent her from taking side turns, or you can quickly engage in the enemy team and start a fight. Do not delay a team fight because it will give Quinn time to take a goal or turn to join her team. Quinn, the selection potential is high."}

Try and stay at maximum distance at any time against Garen. This will reduce its all-in-one potential.

This leaves him vulnerable to incoming damage and CC which could in turn get him killed. \n\nRelies heavily on mana in the laning phase to trade with the enemy. His basic abilities cost tons of mana over an extended period of time."}
{"text": "As twitch, Three points in his Ultimate c will give him a huge peak of power. The ability will increase frequently, allowing him to secure peaks when possible. His life will fly and damage during the end of the game will make him really good in team fights. He will just need to maintain an appropriate positioning and use his s & e at the right time. He will have several articles during this phase of the game. He will allow him to flatten tons of damage."}
{"text": "Against kindred, Kindred will be trying to get as many stacks as possible. If you\u2019re on the same side of the map when one spawns, take a detour to kill the camp so she is unable to get the stack.\n\nAs she is a ranged champion, you need to be careful when trying to duel her as she can use her range advantage and Q to kite you. Unless you get the jump on her, think twice when attempting to duel her.\n\nKindred has the ability to solo objectives with ease. Unless you can take them first, make sure you keep the Dragon warded at all times so you can spot her before she secures the objective."}
{"text": "Against varus, Varus is strong once he has his Ultimate R. It offers him lots of extra damage, can be used to set up ganks and it also increases his survivability.\n\nIn team fights, Varus really shines as his Ultimate R can be used in a variety of ways. He can use it as a self peel tool and as an engage tool.\n\nOnce Varus is level 9, he would\u2019ve maxed his Q. Mix this in with a couple points in W, his Q damage output will be intense. Dodge as many Arrows Q as humanly possible."}
{"text": "As zyra, Continue to use your Q and W for the farm in this way. It is really easy to do so while making sure that you take absolutely no damage from the enemy team. You are really still so make sure to keep yourself and not push when you don't know where the enemy Jungler is. Be part of the neutral objective fights because your AoE burst of damage is quite important and can easily win you a fight."}
{"text": "As ksante, At level 9, you will be maximum on your **Q**. When it is maximized, its damage and cooling will be better, so you can use it more often to inflict more damage to the enemy. At level 11, you will put the 2nd point in your Ultimate it will help you get murders and choices with your team. K=Sante is good in the middle of the game because it is more tankier and will be good in team fights."}
{"text": "As lux, Level six is a massive peak of power because it unlocks Lux's 100 to 0 combo. Any enemy who gets caught by its g will be in a world of pain from now on. Its first element will allow it to spam its abilities with a higher frequency, to inflict more damage, and to assert the domination of the way due to its long reach. Its early play is not so bright because its damage is not too high because of any element. As the game progresses, it should have a simple time with its opponents."}
{"text": "As chogath, ChoGath is still and has a very big hitbox. This makes ChoGath easy to invade and smack with Rek-Sai pre-6. Stay ahead of him even if he Flashes, his hitbox is so big that you can get him up. Avoid trying at 1v1 ChoGath after level 6 because Rek-Sai has a much lower chance of winning the 1v1 because of ChoGath. Instead, put him in place to be caught with your teammates because he has so little way to get away from other champions. ChoGath-Sai has a huge advantage over neutral goals like Baron or Dragon with which Rek-Sai can't compete. Take extreme care when ChoGath is close and avoid neutral goals unless ChoGath is dead, ignorant or in a far area. ChoGath has an extremely weak and linear gank model."}
{"text": "Against jhin, Jhin scales decently into the mid and late game. Try to take advantage of his lack of mobility and weaker combo in the early game to shut him down.\n\nTake note of who his Support is. If he has an engage Support, his level 2 will be very strong as he can use his W to CC chain you with the help of his Support. \n\nWhen Jhin gets 100% crit damage, his trading power will increase dramatically. Always keep an eye on what items he currently has and avoid fighting him alone if his items are better than yours."}
{"text": "Against caitlyn, Caitlyn has limited self peel outside of her t. Whenever she is overextended with her E on cooldown, you should look to take her down. If she is not using her E and is playing safe, you could try a Flash engage or ambush her from inside a bush.\n \nAn enemy Caitlyn can dish out a lot of damage in a team fight if she is left unchecked. Try to focus her down as soon as possible so she is unable to dish out lots of damage. If she is being protected, try to flank her.\n \nPunishing Caitlyn in the early game will reduce her ability to snowball and destroy your tower. Try and set her behind by killing her over and over with assistance from your allies."}
{"text": "Against ahri, Even if it will play the role of Support, Ahri has a big explosion and chooses the potential on targets that move around the card alone. Make sure to regroup and avoid walking in areas that are not rewarded when you know Ahri, when the Ahri are nearby. Ahri is incredibly vulnerable when her Ultimate is on the ground. Forcing fights when it is on the ground will make it difficult for her to fight, trade and escape a team fight. Be on the lookout for active Ahri items, as she will use them to isolate and remove slow and motionless champions."}
{"text": "Against teemo, Teemo may not join team fights as he isn\u2019t very good in them. He may instead be split pushing and trying to take objectives in the side lanes. Make sure someone is able to stop him from splitting.\n\nTeemo will place Mushrooms t around objectives and in high traffic areas. Avoid going anywhere that Teemo has recently been in without a Sweeping Lens. He and his teammates may be ready and waiting and try and pounce on you.\n\nAs Teemo will be split pushing or away from his team during fights, you could use the numbers advantage to force a fight 4v4 or 5v4. Just keep an eye on him and be prepared to rotate if he gets close to your tower."}
{"text": "As corki, When Corki finished his first element, his clear wave and poke damage will increase sharply. He should not find it at all difficult to keep the enemy pushed in their turn once he finished it. At level 6, Corkis clear wave increases as his e can help him push the enemy in their turn. His e are also a good tool to blow up and push the wave simultaneously. He is not necessarily strong at levels 1-4, and he does not have the largest range of automatic attack. If you play a long-range ADC, with a melee/all-in support, try to abuse his early play."}
{"text": "As trundle, Extremely dependent on teammates to shoot successful ganks that can sometimes force him on the farm and be ineffective during the early game. Although his Ultimate cannot allow him to steal statistics, he is still weak without articles and can be stopped early if the enemy Jungler or Laner manages to kill him once or twice. He can easily be tainted by carts tidyed up once his e has been exhausted. This obliges him to retreat or die, if Trundle finds himself in overextending without any follow-up from his team."}
{"text": "As lissandra, After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, go to a side lane and push. It\u2019s important that you continue to farm during the mid-game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay mid if you can\u2019t get anything done.\n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "As kayn, His objective control is powerful in the Jungle. This is due to his increased clear speeds and his ability to walk through walls when needed. This allows him to take odd Jungle paths.\n\nLevel six is a decent power spike as it allows him to become invulnerable for a while. It becomes stronger once he manages to get his form.\n\nThe first component will give Kayn a massive powerspike as it will bolster both his damage and survivability. It will allow him to duel enemies with ease.        "}
{"text": "As kalista, Kalista's Ultimate x will be useless unless her Jungler comes gank. To compensate for this, she should use track brushes and early skim power to get the enemy team out. The first element will only add to Kalista's overall potential of duo and skirmishes. It will allow her to dominate the track provided she correctly uses her Passive. Several points in her re will make her powerful in two departments. She will be able to run the enemies with ease. She will also be able to take neutral goals reliably."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Three points in her Ultimate e will give her a massive power spike. The ability will dish out a lot of damage and have a very short cooldown, so team fights will be frequent.\n\nHer life steal combined with her damage and mobility during the late game will make her really good in team fights. She will just need to maintain proper positioning.\n\nShe will have multiple items during this phase of the game. It will allow her to dish out tons of damage and one-shot squishy champions. Prolonged team fights will see her winning effortlessly."}
{"text": "As zed, During the middle of the game, you just have to look for picks all around the map. It's time for the track swaps so it should be easy for you to get killed. Still target carries as much as you can. They can't do much to save themselves and you'll be able to escape with the help of your Ultimate R. Look for the sides of the enemy team and see if you can catch them out of sight using the fog of war. This will make the team fights really unfair for the enemy team."}
{"text": "Against anivia, If you do not know where Anivia is, it is plausible that she is hiding in a bush waiting for you to walk before crashing with her t and e. Keep this in mind when returning to the track. Don't forget Anivias Passive. He has a long cooldown, so once he's jumped, make sure you try to kill her while she's most vulnerable. Call for help and ask for ganks while he's down. Try not to use any dash that can help you avoid address blows. Anivias t and e can be fatal if you don't have tools to get away from them. Make sure your dash is always up so you can avoid his t."}
{"text": "As camille, Camille can't really start trading too well up to level 4. Once she unlocked all her abilities and has several points in her Q, she can start trading. Camille next peak of power in the track is when she unlocks her Ultimate R. He offers her a lot of pressure to kill and is good to set up her Jungler. If you can't make use of her in your own way, you could wander with her to help your allies. Once Camille has finished her first component, her ability to trade with the enemy will intensify."}
{"text": "As sona, Just focus on poking the enemy with your Q and do not overextend. The goal is to scale up and reach the late game.\n\nUse your W very discreetly as thee ability costs a lot of mana.

His e and e allows him to drop tower aggro and take reduced tower damage respectively.\n\nIs a scaling monster, and if he manages to get his items and hit the mid-to-late game, he will be almost unstoppable. For a squishy champion, he can one-man the Baron if he is ahead.\n\nHis Ultimate r can completely shift the tide of a fight if he is left unchecked. This allows him to use his e frequently, which allows him to avoid CC. Combined with his Wuju Style, he deals a lot of damage."}
{"text": "As illaoi, Try your hardest to win as much gold as possible. The more illaoi of gold wins, the harder it will be to manage in the later parts of the laning/game phase. Once you have level 6, you can look for an all-in or go for a murder. Try to make them low before doing it however. Poke the enemy as often as possible with your E and Q. If you can make them low and play around your Tentacle placements, your ability to get a murder in the way will increase."}
{"text": "As graves, Roaming and picking should be pretty easy for you during this phase of the game. Try to take down unsuspecting enemies in the side lane to make team fights unfair for the enemy.\n\nYou will be able to blow up enemies due to your entire build during this phase of the game. Just make sure that you don't get caught out as you are squishy and killed if CC'd during this phase.\n\nGetting a defensive item should benefit you a lot. It will counter your squishiness and allow you to make more aggressive plays overall. Make it a point to use the fog of war and get free kills on the enemy when possible."}

When she\u2019s low, there\u2019s your chance to fight.\n \nDuring team fights, Diana's kit offers a lot of burst damage thanks to her Ultimate R.

{"text": "As kalista, During the middle of the game, try to take as many fights as possible physically to make use of your escarment power. During the fight, make sure you don't go too much ham and abandon your front line. Your Ultimate x will be useful during this phase of the game because you can quickly start engaging with the ability. Use it on the team's tanky person for maximum efficiency. Your W will help you avoid a premature disappearance that occurs on the face verification of a brush. Use the W to cover the back of objective pits during neutral and objective fights."}
{"text": "Against sion, Sion has a deceptively powerful laning phase. So, pay attention to its Q poke. Try to avoid it by moving left or right instead of walking backwards. Post 6, Sion has good gank set up and can escape ganks quite easily. Its death pressure also increases, so be aware of its level 6 peak power."}
{"text": "As nasus, Use your Q to frequently poke Nasus in this matchup. This will help you to reduce his stacking mechanic and make it easier for you to take him down.\n\nWhen possible, try to engage on Nasus when his W is on cooldown. This will reduce his ability to slow you down, allowing you to deal more damage and increase your chances of taking him down.\n\nYour ultimate can be a key tool in this matchup. Consider using it to interrupt Nasus' ultimate and disrupt his damage output. This can be a pivotal moment in the fight and help turn it in your favor.\n\nBuilding armor items is important in this matchup.

Make sure to play around your Ultimate w to get kills again and again. Once Ashe has a few points in his y, his poke can be incredibly difficult to manage. Make sure to harass the enemy as often as you can After your first back, you will recover your first component. The additional damage it provides will help you in the prolonged trades with your Q, and increase your poke damage with your y. Start playing more aggressive after your first back."}

Your Ultimate e can be used as an execute, so it should help you get a lead."}
{"text": "As reksai, Its first ability will be maximized to level 9. This means that it will do a lot of damage and will be able to finish the enemies quickly. Its team fight is quite decent.

{"text": "As viego, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. Post 6, avoid fighting them at any cost because they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will kill you easily.

Try to play accordingly to all of his potential new abilities.\n\nTry and avoid fighting in the river or in the jungle as Viego\u2019s E can make him very hard to kill.

{"text": "Against masteryi, Disengagement is Master Yi's worst nightmare. As soon as he activates his Ultimate r and runs to your team, disengagement so that he can not resume the fight. When he is weak, make sure to get over it even if Master Yi is not there. If he takes free and easy blows, he will make heavy snowballs and take over from the next team fight.

{"text": "Against rumble, Rumble is very immobile and subject to all in. Try to freeze the wave closer to your side of the map. This will force it to extend for the farm, which can allow you to all of it, deny it from the farm or even set up your Jungler for an easy take. Rumble is rather squishy early and suffers strongly when its r is on the cooldown because it will lack damage."}

Ending the game quickly is often the wisest choice when playing against him.\n\nTwitch\u2019s first power spike is level 2 as he gets access to his s and can gank a lane. Be prepared for the level 2 gank and play cautiously in the first few minutes.\n\nOnce Twitch has got Runaan's Hurricane, his damage output will be deadly. It is very important that you do not let him dish out his damage by bursting him down at the start of the fight."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Very squishy and can be easily burst down when his E is down. Junglers can camp him at that stage as well since he will have no other form of escape left, and his E has a very long cooldown.\n\nTakes quite some time to scale up due to how his itemization works. This is also dependent on the fact that he is very skill shot heavy and will need to land his Qs on the enemy in order to be effective.\n\nBuffering his E won\u2019t work too well if the enemy has some form of ranged CC which they can use to follow-up on Ezreal after he has used his E.

It is necessary to make sure that he throws the target in the right direction."}
{"text": "Against jax, It is very good for the duelling. Once Jax gets his first element, it becomes much more difficult to duel unless you have elements that match his damage.

Keep an eye on him at any time he will seek to divide the thrust and take goals quickly."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Avoid regrouping closely because this will give Malphite a great opportunity to land a 5 person who strikes with his Ultimate h. Don't look for fighting in the jungle or around the Dragon or Baron. That's because the teams will usually be grouped closely together- which allows him to get a good Ultimate h off. Instead, try to fight in the open air in a way. Poke and disengagement are the biggest threats.

This will prevent Hecarim from fearing the whole team and will allow the enemy team to retaliate. Hecarim is not able to flank the enemy freely if the enemy team puts a good vision around the way they fight. This will force Hecarim to engage on the enemy team in a direct way, which will allow the enemy team to react accordingly."}
{"text": "Against taric, Disengagement as soon as Taric has activated his Ultimate R so that the enemy takes damage. If a target is weak however, try to shoot them down quickly before the Ultimate R comes into effect. Taric has surprisingly good engagement and catch the potential with his E. Watch his positioning at any time so it's really hard for him to catch someone."}
{"text": "Against amumu, If you are a strong 1v1 champion, try to invade him early to put him behind and delay his level 6 power peak. Amumu must hit level 6 as quickly as possible so that he can gank with his Ultimate y. Try to gank as soon as possible so that your allies are stronger than his. This will make it harder for him to gank when he comes to time. As suggested, Amumu has a weak start game and will be looking for the power farm. If he shows on the map, or if you are stronger than him, you could invade his jungle and steal some of his camps. This will delay his level 6 power peak and delay his Ultimate y that in turn, will also delay some of his ganks."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, His early play is quite decent because he can simply go for coherent jobs and return to safety because of his y. He will not take much damage either with the proper use of this ability. The first element is a decent peak because it strengthens his survival and damage. He will help him to take the track easily. Level six is a massive peak because he can now impact team fighting overall. He can also look for flanks and dive the enemy rear line."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Watch your positioning at all times so it can't put crucial spells on you. Its level 6 is much stronger than yours. Disengagement if it clicks on R. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to force it to exceed for the farm. Try to match its thrust power however, as you don't want it to win a gold lead by getting early turret plates."}
{"text": "Against alistar, Alistar can and probably will engage as soon as you get into range. Try to stay at max range at all times to limit his ability to engage with his t>e.\n \nEven though Alistar\u2019s Headbutt is a point and click ability, you can still dodge it by dashing, blinking or Flashing before it hits you. You can also interrupt the dash with knock-ups, knockbacks or knockdowns.\n \nAlistar will look to roam if the lane gets stale. Make sure to punish him by looking to fight the enemy ADC or zone them away from farm while he\u2019s gone. Make sure you ping as soon as he leaves lane so your allies know he\u2019s gone."}
{"text": "As kalista, Your early goal is to keep them down. Try to avoid going for extended jobs because they will often win those. Treat for their level 2 all-in. They can play aggressively at level 2 and gain an important advance in health. Similarly, try to keep the minion wave even or closer to your side of the map. This will reduce its all-in potential and keep you safe. You are stronger than them at level 6, as your Ultimate can be used in a fight. But, the utility they provide ina skirmish is also very valuable and their Support could be everything in you at level 6."}
{"text": "As corki, When Corki finished his first article, his clear wave and poke damage will increase sharply. He should not find it at all difficult to keep the enemy pushed into their turn once he finished it. At level 6, Corkis clear wave increases as his e can help him push the enemy in their turn. His e are also a good tool to blow up and push the wave simultaneously. He's not necessarily strong at levels 1-4, but he has his basic attacks, and his Passive that makes him annoying to handle if you play like a melee champion against him."}
{"text": "Against jax, Aim to trade when Jax has used his E as it will block basic attacks. It has a long cooldown, so make sure you exploit his weakness.\n\nJax has no build-in sustain and is melee. If you have the range advantage, try to poke and harass him as much as possible to prevent him from looking for the all-in. This will also force him to burn through his potions quickly.\n\nAfter level 6, every third auto will deal extra magic damage. Do not commit to extended trades with him- especially if he\u2019s been able to stack his auto attacks on minions beforehand. "}
{"text": "As malphite, Level 6 is a significant powerpike for Malphite because it allows it to unlock its real combo of brilliant damage. Once it reaches level 6, its roams become more powerful, and its presence becomes intimidating for the enemy. Malphite has significantly less pressure before-6, and it is completely dependent on the brushes of the track to not get hit in the way. All that it can do is sometimes throw a rock on one of the enemies with its d. Once it gets its first element, it will do a lot of damage with its d in the way."}
{"text": "As neeko, Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to inflict massive damage with his Ultimate R. The cooldown will also be reduced. It will now have its basic elements, allowing him to deal with a lot of damage. This will help his team during the fighting, especially the fights of choking points. The first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will increase his overall damage in the game, and she can easily ambushed someone."}
{"text": "Against twistedfate, Twisted Fate will look for picks with his Ultimate y during the mid-game. Avoid splitting too far apart to reduce his ability to get picks.\n\nAs Destiny y gives him a lot of map pressure, expect him to be split pushing in the mid-game. While you could fight with the numbers advantage, make sure you keep an eye on him so you can disengage if he makes his way to the fight.\n\nTwisted Fate will look to poke as much as possible before initiating. Do not allow him to poke by engaging as soon as you spot him."}
{"text": "Against kalista, The extended trades will always favor Kalista thanks to its r. Try and avoid going to expand the trades with it. Kalista is the first peak of power when she takes her Greaves from Berserker as he will give her the first piece of attack speed that she needs snowball. Once Kalista has finished Hurricane Runaan, she will pump much more damage and apply Rend re stacks really quickly."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Can deal heavy amounts of burst damage in a very short time, which gives the enemy very little time to react. One such C E Q combo can ruin the enemy laners life.\n\nHer Ultimate R allows her to traverse a long distance almost immediately and can provide a lot of utility in choke points. This will also give her traction to easily land her C.\n\nHer E is really effective against enemies who have some form of dash. She can thus make life a living hell for laners who rely a lot on dashes."}
{"text": "As kaisa, Extremely vulnerable when her E is down as she can be an easy target to CC at that point. If she uses that ability carelessly, she will die a lot of times in the lane, as well as during team fights.\n\nImproper positioning or aggressive usage of her Ultimate R can get her killed on multiple occasions. This can allow the enemy team to bait her in and get rid of her pretty quickly.\n\nIf she is set back during the early game, she won\u2019t be able to come online as fast as her counterparts. As she is extremely item reliant, she will need to be peeled for as well."}
{"text": "Against singed, Singed\u2019s level 1 is strong in the right matchup. Expect him to proxy farm the first few waves to get an early lead.\n\nOnce Singed hits level 6, his kill pressure and overall annoyingness increases. Once he activates his Ultimate n, it would be a good idea to disengage and avoid fighting him.\n\nSinged is really good in the mid-game as he can draw a lot of pressure. At this time, he will have lots of damage and be super tanky and fast. It will be hard for you to kill him alone. "}
{"text": "As warwick, You will want to look for regular burst trades with Warwick. Your W and E should allow you to win fights easily.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to all-in enemies regularly. You may even be able to gank other lanes as and when possible.\n\nGetting your core items should allow you to fight way more easily and sustain yourself in the lane. Your Q will be really beneficial for you to ensure survival during the brunt of the fight.        "}

{"text": "Against soraka, Soraka can prevent an all-in by placing her E Silence on herself as soon as you commit. Try to lure the E Silence before looking for the all-in. To increase your death pressure in a Soraka match, focus the Soraka rather than the CDA. Focusing on CDA will not be useful because Soraka can simply cure them with his W. If you get it, try to get an early execution call. This will reduce his ability to heal and increase your death pressure in the way."}
{"text": "As viego, Having 2 points in his Ultimate R will allow Viego to kill his targets more easily. This will help him a lot during team fights and skirmishes near objective pits. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This will give him a massive boost to his skirmish potential. He will be powerful during fights in choking points. Viego is good in team fights because he can move quickly through his crucial targets E, CC with his W, and win several skills with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As kayn, It is very dependent to play around its Passive before getting its shape. If it happens that it gets the wrong shape early, it will be rearranged massively. With its Ultimate R, it becomes completely dependent on the positioning of the target that it is in. If the target takes it under their turn and the CCs, it will take a lot of damage. Its E can be interrupted. This allows the enemy team to put it in a very disadvantageous position that can actually get it killed immediately."}
{"text": "As lillia, The first element will give him a huge boost in the Jungle. He will make his ganks more powerful, especially once she has her final R. She will be able to clean up the camp quite quickly as well. Lilia is an early ganker and should use the lack of vision during the early match to disrupt the enemies and force them to concede their ways to her teammates. The search for pushed targets should be relatively easy for her. Level 6 is an important power peak for her. This will improve her potential of gank and team combat, and she will be able to decimate enemies who are stuck together during the fighting."}
{"text": "As trundle, If they die at first, you won't be able to win the fight alone. Don't get caught off during this phase of the game, because you'll end up losing crucial goals if you do. Stay with your team and count on choices to make team fights uneven. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to get the enemy down one by one. If you focus on the rear line alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and die quickly. By focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "Against zeri, Its first major power peak is at level 6 as it gets access to its Ultimate R. It will be really strong at this stage of the game. Once it has finished its first component, its trading ability increases sharply. Beware of trading if it gets its first component before you. It is good in team fights thanks to the AOE on its Ultimate R. It will be good when the enemies are grouped closely together."}
{"text": "Against janna, Janna will try to poke as often as she can with her d and auto-attacks. If you\u2019re playing as a melee champion, try to minimize your time spent overextended while getting warding quest stacks. \n\nShe may wait for her m to be up before trading. This pattern is pretty common against champions who can return fire when she looks to trade. Use the m cooldown time frame to poke her.\n\nWhen playing as a melee champion, make sure Janna doesn\u2019t bully you down with basic attacks. When you can\u2019t engage, stand out of range and in line with your ADC so she can\u2019t harass and bully you. "}
{"text": "As irelia, Prone to CC once she goes in. This is lethal for her if the enemy team has layered CC, or if she delves too deep into the enemy team and has no form of follow up from her team.\n\nHer Q usage needs a lot of practice and awareness. If mistimed, that ability will go on cooldown and she won\u2019t be able to do much if she isn\u2019t close to her target. This will also make her prone to CC.\n\nLanding her Ultimate R on ranged carries can be a grueling task, especially if the enemy has some form of dash.

Brand, second power peak is once it unlocks its Ultimate R. It will offer it a lot of additional damage and will help it blow up any support or ADC squishy. Once Brand has picked up the first element of its Mythic, its damage output will increase sharply. You will see a significant increase in damage with more items and more points in your W."}
{"text": "As galio, Be careful of Galio's level 2 potential on your ADC. Galio can quickly commit and inflict significant damage, so be prepared to help your ADC disengage or use your W (you and me!) to get out of it. When you withdraw from your ADC, try to stay close to them. This allows you to attach more easily to them with your W and help them escape Galio's engagement. If Galio errs, ping your teammates to alert them and enjoy his absence by harassing and putting pressure on his ADC. Keep the wave closer to your turret. This reduces Galio's ability to engage and makes it more difficult for him to exchange effectively or go all of it."}

{"text": "As karma, Karma has a lot of poke damage and utility to offer during the mid-game. It makes her really potent when it comes to dealing with enemies who are always grouped up.\n\nAt level eleven, she will have her first ability maxed out. Depending on the ability she maxes, she will either be dealing a lot of burst damage to the enemies, or she will be peeling for her carries very effectively.\n\nKarma shines during mid-game fights as she can keep her entire team safe at any given moment while dealing consistent damage to the enemy. This makes her a really viable choice when dealing with heavy engagers."}
{"text": "Against pantheon, Look out for ambushes around the map. He is really good at starting skirmishes and picking off weak and immobile champions. Keep this in mind and avoid walking around the map alone.\n\nIn team fights, once they go in with their E, they have nothing to offer and will be in an overextended position. Use their forward positioning to play aggressive and take them down.\n\nTry to constantly poke and harass him. Having him on low health will prevent him from playing or positioning aggressively."}
{"text": "As amumu, Your Ultimate y is an amazing tool that can deal damage and CC the whole enemy team if you\u2019re able to hit them all with it. This makes Amumu an incredibly strong team fighter.\n\nAmumu\u2019s build path is incredibly versatile. Does your team need a tank? You can build tank. Does your team need AP? You can build AP. If you\u2019re ahead, you could go for a full AP build and blow up the enemies.\n\nAmumu has a fast clear thanks to the AOE damage from his r and m.

{"text": "As ziggs, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate from them or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy with your Q and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not let yourself be caught trying to harass and bring down the enemy."}

{"text": "As chogath, It is a good peak of power for him because it will allow him to exchange more effectively with the enemy lantern. When he puts 2 points in his Ultimate t at level 11, his death pressure increases considerably as his Ultimate t will allow him to execute a higher health enemy.

Track brushes should help significantly when it comes to landing this capability. Yasuo will win a small point each time it puts an additional point in its r. It improves its rpoke damage, which allows it to look for all in once it reaches level 6. The best time to go for an all-in is when the primary form of CC of the enemy is in decline.

Do not overextend during the fights as you are still. The enemy will try to lure your E out so be very careful. During neutral objective fighting, you should be able to disrupt a fight due to your ultimate R, especially if the enemy is enclaved. Just make sure that you land the ability and use your W properly."}

When Jhin gets 100% write-off damage, his trading power will increase considerably. Always keep an eye on what he currently has and avoid fighting him alone if his articles are better than yours. At level 9, Jhin will be much stronger than he would have put the final point in his Q."}

{"text": "As vladimir, After level 6, Vladimir gets a peak of power with his e, so play a little more passively against him in this stage. The best opportunity to talk with Vladimir is when he used his l, because it's his only tool or survival in his kit, and he can inflict damage while using it with his I>E combo, so that he makes it even more vital for him. Vladimir is strong at all stages of the game, because he has so integrated the hold and the ladders later, but wavplelar is the only thing you have that is more powerful than his."}
{"text": "As corki, Keep delaying team fighting as long as possible while you harass and push the enemy down with your b and e. Stick with your team in the late game. Do not separate or walk away from them otherwise the enemy can try to withdraw or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Think hard and fast before using your Passive and b to the enemy team. In particular, do not use it aggressively if your team is not able to track and enter with you."}

As a result, she will easily win any duel, provided she didn't fall drastically behind during the early or mid-game.\n\nGwen excels during team fights as she can dish out a lot of damage, especially when fighting around clumped areas. Her W allows her to mitigate a lot of damage, and her E lets her reposition quite quickly.\n\nGwen does deceptively high amounts of damage during this phase of the game due to her items. She will also have maxed out most of her abilities. She can spam her abilities, which directly translates into more damage and healing for her."}
{"text": "Against skarner, Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map to reduce its all-in-one potential and limit its use of its E and Ultimate.

If playing a varied champion, try to harass and intimidate him with basic attacks and abilities to get an early health advance."}

{"text": "As gwen, In the late game, stay with your team. Avoid getting too far away from them because the enemy can force a fight while you're gone. Focus the closest enemy champion in the team fights. Even with your W, you're always squishy and vulnerable to the enemy rear line. Focus the same champion as your allies focus.

Make sure to invest in the Execute of the Appeal or another element that inflects serious wounds to reduce his healing. In the team fights, Ignite will help reduce his healing, so make sure to Ignite him as soon as he engages. Control of the crowd is your best friend against Dr. Mundo.

He can even a-shot door, provided he manages to catch them out of sight."}

This makes her a really good source of peel."}
{"text": "Against zed, If you play like a varied champion, try to harass and poke Zed down. Avoid excess commitment to harass him although minion damage does pile heavily. Invest in early armor when you play like a Mage to protect yourself from Zed damage. This will reduce his chances of killing you. Try to play the opposite side of the way at any time. This will make it difficult for Zed to reach you without using his W. Once he uses his W, go to the other side of his Shadow W so he can't get on you."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas reaches level 16, he will have his Ultimate R maximd out.

As Jungler, Gragas will mainly be the last, so his main goal will be to blow up the enemy rear line when he gets lucky.

She can quickly run the enemies now that the amount of healing she gets from the output of capacity damage is quite powerful. She should win a duel with ease from now.

{"text": "As riven, After entering with your Ultimate e, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you are gone. Play around your Ultimate e in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate e is standing. Fighting with outside will make the fights of the late game team much harder."}
{"text": "Against udyr, Udyr is a strong dueler in early play. Unless you have a clear advantage, avoid fighting it in a 1v1 scenario. Udyr has good objective control and can solo goals like the Dragon with ease. Make sure to keep the Drake monitored at all times to reduce his chances of securing them for free. Unlike most champions, it does not point to level 6 as it can unlock his Ultimate R at level 1. If you have a Strong Ultimate, try to abuse cooldown and help your allies."}

Once you CC someone, burst them down before moving on to the next target.\n\nYour Ultimate R should allow you to make a lot of plays all around the map. Any fight around congested areas should be an easy win for you if you land your Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As galio, During the middle of the game, you should be ready to secure as many choices as you can. Work with your Jungler and install death brushes inside the enemy Jungle. Chokepoint fights will be really beneficial to you during this phase of the game. Just make sure you can land a W multi-man on the enemy team and then allow your team to collapse on the CC'd enemies. Try to help your Jungler during neutral and objective battles, especially when the Jungler is in the objective pit. Your Ultimate R will be able to cover the entire circumference of the pit, so it will help you to disrupt enemies with ease."}
{"text": "Against swain, At level 6, the exit and survival of the damage increases. You should not engage in a fight with him unless you can bring him down quickly that his Ultimate R will offer him additional protection and health regeneration. Swain, early play is abuseable because it is really weak early. Once the mid-game hits, you will have to play more respectable. It is really good in the team fights thanks to his AOE Ultimate R. Bursting him at the beginning of the fight will make it difficult for him to inflict damage and win the fight."}
{"text": "As lux, Really good burst potential with her entire g, l, Ultimate n combo. This can delete a squishy enemy with ease starting from level six itself.\n\nHer e shield is deceptively strong as it can allow her to save all her team members from a lot of poke. This is also applicable when she is Support.\n\nHer g can be used to secure picks inside the enemy Jungle or from blind areas. This can be extremely beneficial if the picked target happens to be the enemy Jungler or the ranged carry."}

{"text": "As zilean, Before six it is rather squishy, and easily killable if its p is on cooldown. This also makes it vulnerable to crowd control, especially when it tries to poke with its Q. Its Q is quite telegraphed and it can be easily punished once its Q is down. Again, its Q can also be skipped by flashing / moving away from the point of fall of its Q. It is rather a poke / bot of damage when its Ultimate t is down. Zilean is intrinsically squishy so it shouldn't be a problem to shoot it once his Ultimate t is on cooldown."}
{"text": "As soraka, Extremely squishy early on and is very susceptible to burst/poke damage. She can be easily gotten rid of if she gets crowd controlled.\n\nImproper usage of her E can give windows to the enemy team to all-in Soraka or her laner partner. Trying not to use it for poke is Soraka\u2019s best bet.\n\nHer healing can easily be reduced with the purchase of a Grievous Wounds item. She is also countered by enemies who have some form of dash which they can use to dodge her Q."}

You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure you try to exploit your early advantage.\n\nLook to secure objectives whenever they\u2019re up. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes along.\n\nFind a healthy balance between ganking your allies, farming your jungle and securing objectives. Make sure you do not fall behind in XP by trying to constantly gank."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Don't fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available as you're going to miss on the CC it provides. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far forward or out of position. Peel for your rides to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Always look at your positioning during the laning phase. Try and stay at maximum distance so it is more difficult for her to root with her E. This will also make it harder for her to get a good R Ultimate as she has to close the gap in order to stun you. Stand outside the minion wave at any time if possible. This will make it harder for Neeko to push you and poke you at the same time with her Q. Once Neeko has its Ultimate R, her death pressure will increase. Make sure to come back when she is low whenever she has her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As teemo, Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs. As you are not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}

{"text": "As nasus, He needs time to come online. He's weak early and can't really gank unless he's easy to kill set up for him. He doesn't have the greatest objective control. He'll need his allies to help him secure the Drake and Rift Herald. Relieve strongly on the late game to win."}
{"text": "Against zac, Zac really has long cooling times on his engagement abilities. As a result, he can really use them as a tool of engagement or escape only once in a fight. If you know that he is without these abilities- try to fight him. Placing the vision around his entrances into the jungle and into the river will reduce his ability to get successful ganks. Note that Zac can gank from afar with his E however. The easiest way for Zac to kill the Crab Scuttle is by using his E. If you see him killing the Crab Scuttle, it will usually mean that his E is on cooldown and he will miss an escape tool."}
{"text": "As skarner, During the middle of the game, look to divide the thrust and apply the pressure around the map. You can use your E to escape the collapse of the enemies. Look to flank in the team fights with your E and Ultimate. Lock the key targets that have overheard or mispositioned. Otherwise, group with your team and fight the enemy in the jungle or around the goals. Somewhere they will be grouped so you can lock several targets with your Ultimate."}

Regular poking will eventually get him killed if he stays in the lane.\n\nHe can outplay himself with his E if he goes in and mistimes the E duration. Crowd control is his mortal enemy, and he can be taken out quite easily due to his squishiness.\n\nHis Ultimate R doesn\u2019t have a lot of width, which makes it really easy for the enemies to dodge it from range. This will require Yone to get close to the enemy team, which can put him in a vulnerable position."}
{"text": "Against udyr, Udyr is a good early Jungler game. Avoid giving him murders to reduce his ability to carry in the middle of the game. Trinity Force is a key element on Udyr. Once he has this article, taking it alone will be difficult. Equipping with one or two buddies to make it easier to kill him. Udyr falls from in the late part, but it can still be useful thanks to his E. Avoid overextending if you know Udyr is nearby."}
{"text": "As yone, It's not early against the various matches because it can be swiped quite easily. Regular Poking will eventually get him killed if he stays in the way. He can overplay with his E if he goes and bad time the E duration. Control of the crowd is his mortal enemy, and he can be removed quite easily due to his squishiness. His ultimate R doesn't have much width, which makes it really easy for enemies to avoid him from range. This will require Yone to get closer to the enemy team, who can put him in a vulnerable position."}
{"text": "Against heimerdinger, Try to fight as a team in the open air so that he is unable to use his E qualified to stun your entire team. Do not fight in the jungle because the size of his E is about the same as the jungle. Once Heimerdinger reaches level 6, he technically unlocks 3 new abilities. Be careful trying to initiate a skirmish with him because he could just remove his magic card and kill you."}
{"text": "Against zac, Zac\u2019s E can be used from afar to start the team fight. Make sure you ward your flanks when sieging an objective. \n\nAvoid fighting in the jungle as it will make it easier for Zac to land his E and knock up your whole team with his Ultimate R. Fight in the open when possible.\n\nDo not group too closely. If you\u2019re split up slightly, it will be impossible for Zac to catch out and knock up your whole team with his E and Ultimate R."}

When trying to team fight, engage as soon as you spot her- do not let her auto-attack for free in the backline.\n\nAt level 6, Jinx\u2019s Ultimate R can be a great trading tool and it can turn the tide of the lane. If she is not using it in her own lane, she might try to secure kills with it in other lanes with it. If you see her use her Ultimate R and it\u2019s headed topside, ping your team.\n\nAt level 9, Jinx\u2019s auto-attacks will deal lots of damage as she would\u2019ve maxed Q by then. Keep this in mind and avoid fighting her alone as she is good in extended trades."}

Avoid going for extended duels when he is about to remount. \n\nTry and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make his all-in less effective. Neither will he be able to chase you down with his Ultimate R once you walk up to farm."}
{"text": "As camille, In the first few levels, play safe and avoid trading. Camille\u2019s very early game damage is rather weak, so you\u2019ll probably lose a trade vs an aggressive laner.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 4, you can look to fight and punish the enemy.

Just make sure you push the wave before leaving lane."}

This means that it will only let her make plays, but she still needs to land her basic abilities to do damage.\n\nThe first component will allow her to spam abilities and dish out a lot of damage to her enemies. It will be incredibly beneficial during the laning phase.\n\nTaliyah is relatively weak during the early game as her lane is shorter and can be ganked easily.

Its shield e is misleadingly strong as it can allow it to save all members of its team from a lot of poke. This is also applicable when it is Support. Its g can be used to secure peaks inside the enemy Jungle or blind areas. This can be extremely beneficial if the chosen target is found to be the enemy Jungler or the varied port."}

A maxed-out Ultimate R will help Senna a lot during the team fights. She can dry a lot of damage with the ability if she can align it properly. All her important items will be finished now, and she will be able to dry a lot of damage in very short jobs. She should be peeled by her allies during this point."}

Keep track of his Ultimate R in fights as he can use it to either set up an escape or engage.\n\nKeep vision in typical flanking spots as Ekko will try to set up an engage with his W from out of vision. If you see him running towards you, back up for a few seconds as he would have used his W.\n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, Ekko will be looking to split push.

It will also allow him to take the enemies with his Ultimate R slow. The first element will allow Jhin to do much more damage to the enemies and will strengthen his fourth firing efficiency. It will help his phase of overall lacquering by many. Jhin's Q is both his capability of clear wave damage and primary."}

Keep the wave closer to your side of the road to create opportunities to help the jungle and to have a longer way to pursue Karma and its ADC if necessary. If Karma errs, focus on punishing the enemy CDA by trying to kill or apply pressure. Karma is known for her roaming potential, so expect her to leave the road frequently."}

Don't walk through the nonwarded areas alone if you're uncertain where Elise is during the middle and end of the game.

This is especially true when he is ahead of the game. He can literally pull the enemy out of the rear line in a spin of spells, if he reaches W E on them.

Look for battles where the enemy is closely grouped (as in the jungle or around a goal) and try CC as many enemy champions as possible. Once you have used your Ultimate on the enemy, ask yourself what you need to do next. Either stay behind the enemy or peel for your portages. If the enemy has an all-in-front line, prepare to fall and help your portages keep them alive."}
{"text": "As maokai, A supertank that has a ton of CC integrated into its kit. It can act as a very good front line for its team and can also peel targets from its aircraft carriers. Its ultimate R can allow it to engage at a great distance. It is extremely beneficial when it is used out of sight, or when enemies are near a wall. Provides a lot of vision with its E, which also makes room for the control of the brush. Combine its slow E with its W, it can practically choose a target and CC for a while while while its team has just followed it."}
{"text": "As leesin, You have a lot of presence during early play. Roam every opportunity you get, especially on pushed enemy targets, to get an advance.

He can all-in the enemy at level 3 when he gets access to all 3 basic abilities.\n\nAt level 6, Xin Zhao\u2019s kill pressure heavily increases. He can instantly kill any enemy laner and chase them down once he has his Ultimate R.\n\nAfter Xin has picked up his first component item, he can trade very aggressively with the enemy. Furthermore, the extra damage he gets from this item will help him last hit and farm easily.\n"}

He can easily be in between the enemy team while dealing a lot of health and regenerating a lot of health in return.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to spam his abilities frequently and dish out a lot of damage. It helps a lot with his overall laning prowess."}
{"text": "Against lillia, When Lillia has maximized its first capacity at level 9, its train power will increase sharply. Level 6 is a good peak of power for Lillia in the upper track.

Elise can easily take goals on herself, but you will have more security if you do it with your allies."}

While you will deal a considerable amount of damage, it will be harder for you to one-shot targets as the enemy team would\u2019ve started to pick up defensive items.\n\nAt level 16, Zyra will put the final point in her Ultimate R. The utility and damage this ability provides at this rank is very good, and she will be a menace in team fights.\n\nThanks to her low cooldowns and plants, Zyra will help her team quickly secure neutral objectives such as the Baron or Elder Dragon.

If you're flanking a non-warded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late match as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your cooldown Ultimate in the late match. Avoid team fighting when your Ultimate is down to make sure you're useful in team fighting!"}

Kalista is a very strong champion from the beginning of the game. Try to harass and get her down so she can't play aggressive and snowball. Position Level 6, be careful to concentrate the enemy Support in a job that Kalista can save them with her Ultimate x. Keep this in mind and try to concentrate the Kalista instead."}
{"text": "Against viktor, Viktor first power peak is once it has reached level 6. Its Ultimate m will give it an additional death pressure in the track and it will start playing a little more aggressive. Its capabilities will be stronger with each upgrade. Once Viktor has finished its first element, and improved its y, it will be able to release the minion waves very quickly and keep you pushed under your turn."}

This allows him to use his Ultimate k frequently, which can cause a lot of mayhem in the enemy team.\n\nKassadin will be dealing a lot of damage during this phase of the game. It will let him take off huge chunks off the enemy's health bars, which will allow him to win the game for his team.\n\nHis presence in team fights will be really high, especially if he manages to get a flank on the enemy team.

Don't separate or stay away from them otherwise the enemy can try to take you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team. Focus the closest enemy champion to your carts and work as a team to remove the enemy one by one. If you focus the backline alone, you can be an easy target for the enemy and can die quickly. Focusing on the closest champion, you will survive longer and keep your carts alive."}
{"text": "As gragas, Use your E with extreme caution in this way, as the enemy will try to gank you if you are too pushed up. Ward around properly before doing anything. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should have much more efficiency in the enemy duel. An excellent way to bait the enemy will be to first let the wave push, and then as they are on the point of everything within you, you use your Ultimate R on them and bring them into your turn. Then you can E them and kill them. This should be quite easy to execute, given the length of the track."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Look for choices with your b but avoid shooting in a tank during the late match as it can allow them to start a fight. Try to choose and shoot b in an enemy squishy champion instead. As you are a Support, avoid keeping alone in the late match. If you are chosen, the enemy will be able to take goals nearby or use their digital advantage to win a team fight. Permanently place the vision around the map to help your team secure goals and get choices. Having a vision around the Baron and Dragon is necessary to help your team win."}

The Ultimate e in itself will be handy, though, and Tryndamere can use the lane brushes to catch the enemy by surprise.\n\nTryndamere is really good at split pushing due to his kit. It allows him to 1 v 1 targets with ease while also ensuring that he can escape in time should the enemy team decide to collapse on him.\n\nHe can pretty much duel any enemy during this stage of the game. This is quite a boon as he can make multiple enemies come to him while his team gets objectives."}

He is quite squishy as well so he won\u2019t be able to do much if the enemy team gets healing reduction during the early game.\n\nHis biggest weakness is an enemy team that can ward well.

Roaming to over-extended enemy lanes with her Jungler and lane ganking pushed up enemy lanes should give her a massive lead.\n\nAt this point, Annie will have her core items.

Unloading an E on an enemy squissy champion should lead to an easy murder. This murder could result in either the Baron or a favorable forced fight 5v4.

It takes some time to get used to placing the W traps, especially against enemies who have a dash or flash shape in their kit.

It improves its rpoke damage, which allows it to look for all in once it reaches level 6. The best time to go for an all-in is when the primary form of CC of the enemy is in decline. Once Yasuo gets its first element, it will get a significant increase in its duel potential. This means that it can easily catch up and kill any over-stretch or still target."}

Expect him to play aggressively during levels 1-6. \n\nOnce Gragas gets his Ultimate R, he will be looking for aggressive plays once you overextend. Try to stay as far back from him as possible to make it easier for you to dodge his R.\n\nKeep an eye on what items or playstyle Gragas is going for. If he is building defensive items, he will be tankier. If he\u2019s going damage items, he will dish out a lot of damage incredibly quickly."}
{"text": "As bard, Once again, when Bard puts another point in his Ultimate R at level 16, he will not necessarily pick up as his Ultimate R does not inflict any damage. But, he will be on a shorter cooldown that can allow him to get choices. In the game very late, his abilities will be on much shorter cooldowns. This is very useful for Bard as he will be able to use his Q several times in a team fight. This alone can win his team the fight or help him peel for his wears. The effects of Bard=s Chimes or Meeps becomes better and better as the game develops."}
{"text": "Against renekton, Once it is level 3, it gets its first major power peak and can easily force a flash. Expect this and play respectfully. Once Renekton is level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate t, it can be really aggressive and kill you. If you are weak, remember and avoid pushing the wave if it is ahead as it can all within you while you are overheard. After Renekton has finished his first article, his death pressure also increases. Avoid trading or fooling unless you are ahead."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus will seek to divide the thrust throughout the middle of the game. It is good to divide the thrust thanks to his Q. When Nasus is divided push, you can use the number advantage to start a team fight. During the fight, check the map and keep an eye on Nasus. Be ready to disengage if he is about to take a turn. If Nasus gathers for team fights, try to lock him up with CC so that he is unable to get on your portages and kill them with his Q and R."}
{"text": "As thresh, Ward major objectives and place vision in high traffic areas in the late stages of the game. Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "Against nilah, Avoid fighting in the jungle as teams will be grouped, allowing her to get a multi-person Ultimate off.\n\nBait out her W before starting a team fight and then abuse the cooldown. Wait for it to finish, and then start the fight.\n\nLock her down with CC at the start of the fight. It will make it hard for her to reposition with her E and escape.\n"}
{"text": "As bard, You should be focusing on catching enemies out with your Ultimate R at this point. Playing the role of the disruptor, you should always be on the lookout for neutral objectives as your Ultimate R can stall an objective long enough for your Jungler and team to do something.\n\nDon't forget to collect your chimes regularly. They increase your damage output and you can quite literally 1 v 1 squishy champions if you collect enough of them. Besides, your auto-attack AoE slow will play a major role during team fights.\n\nDuring objective fights, always try to CC the enemy Jungler due to them possessing the Smite summoner spell. This will give your Jungler ample time to steal the Baron. Another thing you may want to do is use your Ultimate R to cancel recalls on a bunch of enemy targets. This works like a charm when your team has a split pusher."}
{"text": "As volibear, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As azir, Azir doesn\u2019t spike at level 11 unlike a lot of champions. Keep this in mind during the mid-game as his Ultimate R may be less impactful compared to other champions on the rift.\n\nAt level 9, Azir will max his r. This is a good power spike for him as he can use it to poke the enemy down from afar. In conjunction with his W, he should be able to poke and farm from afar without dying to the enemy.\n\nWhen Azir completes multiple items, he will be very strong and dish out a lot of damage in a short amount of time. Don\u2019t be afraid to make more aggressive plays when you have an item or two."}
{"text": "As vladimir, At the end of the game, look for choices about the immobile or mispositioned enemies. Taking someone at the end of the game can give you enough time to force a fight, sit a goal or take the Baron or the Elder Dragon. If the enemy is in a group, watch to group with your team too. In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As gragas, Gragas is an early Jungler game. Look at gank as often as possible to get your allies and increase your chances of winning the game. Although, you need to find a healthy balance between agriculture and glove if you want to win. Once Gragas is level 6, its death pressure increases. You should look at gank actively every time your Ultimate R is in place. You have a good Dragon control, so you have to put priority in taking them. You can do them alone or with your allies if they are able to help."}
{"text": "Against neeko, Once Neeko has her Ultimate R, her death pressure will increase. Make sure to come back when you are low when she has her Ultimate R up. Neeko can do a lot of burst damage if she is able to land her E on you. Position to the opposite side of the way and as far back as possible to make it harder for her to land this ability on you."}
{"text": "Against nilah, Keep the wave closer to your side of the map early. It will protect you from her all-ins.\n\nRespect her level 6 power spike. She can quickly kill you when she gets the level up. It\u2019s also important to remember that she will hit level 6 before you.\n\nIf you can, invest in an early Executioner\u2019s Calling. It will help cut down her sustain and make laning against her easier.\n"}
{"text": "Against nautilus, As Nautilus e can hit the players who come into contact with her, if you are close to the concentrated ally, you could be hit as well. Nautilus will often be the first player on his team. Once he has entered the stage, try to concentrate him if his teammates do not follow him. Nautilus fights again to get out once out, so if he makes a mistake, he will abuse Nautilus will automatically attack anyone approaching him by trying CCs with his passive. Try and stay away and out of reach during team fights if you are squishy."}
{"text": "As anivia, It can also increase its chances of surviving in the skirmishes. It is really versatile and can also block the enemy from entering some part of the map. With your Ultimate m, Anivia's seat power is incredibly strong. With a lot of mana, you can constantly push the enemy into the enemy tower and force them to stay in the way."}
{"text": "As volibear, An additional point in his Ultimate R will increase his overall damage and allow him to use the ability frequently. He will help him massively during team fighting. His first ability will be maximized to level 9. This massively increases his damage, and his duel potential will be respectable now. His ability to disrupt team fighting and secure catches during this phase of the game is really high. Just make sure that he has an appropriate follow-up during all the in."}
{"text": "Against ashe, Once Ashe has her Ultimate w, do not overextend as she can easily set up her Jungler with it. Keep the lane warded at all times as that is the only time when it will be safe for you to overextend post 6.\n \nAshe doesn\u2019t have any escape abilities or built-in sustain. Use this to your advantage by poking her down frequently and then looking for the all-in when she is low.\n \nTo prevent Ashe from getting extra damage down on you in the early game, stand behind the minion wave at all times so they block her Volley y damage for you."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he enters with his E, he cannot go out because of his E being on a very high cooldown initially. If his Passive is lowered, he cannot play so aggressively because of the threat of being killed. This is applicable for the early fighting in the middle of the game only. If the enemy avoids staying near the walls, then it will become really difficult for Zac to all-in the fog of the war. He will then have to take conventional gank paths."}
{"text": "As rumble, The effectiveness of Rumble's is greatly diminished when its passive is not half filled. The enemy can try to exchange freely with him during this point. He is rather squishy and vulnerable when his r is on cooling. This also applies when his weapons are overheated, which provides an opening for the enemy to all of him. Due to his immobility, a freeze can completely ruin his laning phase. This will make him inclined to ganks and will not allow him at all to CS."}
{"text": "As gwen, In the first few levels, play safe and avoid committing to any trades. Your very early game is rather weak, so you\u2019ll probably lose trades versus an aggressive laner.\n\nOnce your Passive is stacked, you can look for fights with the enemy. Looking for skirmishes when your Passive is stacked will increase your damage output and increase your chances of killing the enemy.\n\nFocus on good wave management and going for favourable trades. If you are constantly pushing, you will not be able to get kills as your W  doesn\u2019t protect you against tower shots."}
{"text": "As lillia, Lillia is very fast and mobile thanks to her Passive. This makes it difficult to catch her out of position. It will also allow you to avoid skill shots and CC. Unlike many AP champions, Lillia can launch and start a team fight if she can catch several enemies out of position with her E. Ping once you activate your Ultimate R so your team knows you want to enter. It is possible that you are able to put the entire enemy team to sleep with your Ultimate R. This will increase the chances of your winning team. Try to apply your Ultimate R to as many champions as possible."}
{"text": "As leesin, He is a really good early game ganker due to his ability and aggressive playstyle. This means that his presence will be felt early on, and he will capitalize on ganking the enemy and getting a lead early on.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as it adds another damage layer to his overall damage combo. It can also interrupt Teleports and can act as a multi CC ability.\n\nThe first item will allow him to get a damage boost and increased survivability during all-ins. It will give him more chances to get a kill during a duel.        "}
{"text": "Against hwei, When it reaches level 3, it becomes stronger and it is harder to manage. Bait out abilities then fight it. Once it reaches level 6, it unlocks its R which makes it better in 1v1 fights. As the game progresses, and as the teams begin to regroup, Hwei becomes stronger and stronger while he is a great team combat champion."}
{"text": "As sylas, His ultimate R is completely dependent on the comp enemy team. If the enemy has ultimate lacklust, Sylas will not be able to do much. If he is misused, his W can have him killed because of his move to another place. If the enemy buys Grieve Injuries, they can easily counter this healing with a good amount."}
{"text": "As lulu, The damage caused by Lulu's early play, coupled with the utility of his spells, makes it very dominant in the way. It can cancel all-in-one almost immediately with his W and make sure that the high enemy's lantern is pushed out of the way. Level 6 is a massive peak of power. It will now annoy the enemy by completely denying the assassination and breaking out the attempts at the end of the enemy. It can use the ability to slow down enemies, especially those who are trying to escape from it. The first element will surely help Lulu to get out much in the way. It can spame its capabilities frequently and inflict additional damage to the enemy. The track brushes will help him immediately."}
{"text": "Against ekko, Once Ekko reaches level 6, his ganking will be more effective because he can go for more dead and longer ganks thanks to his Ultimate R. If you see that your allies are low and he's on this side of the map, communicate with your team and tell them to remember so they don't die. Ekko can start ganking once he has access to all his 3 of his abilities. He can't really gank too much unless he has all his abilities at his disposal. When Ekko gets his juggling element finished, his trading power gets increased and he can 1v1 most Junglers if he's healthy."}
{"text": "As janna, Level 6 is a massive power peak because she can now heal her entire team during team fights. The return is very beneficial as the last point disengagement tool as well. Janna is a monster during the early match and is very oppressive in the way due to her d. She should use the track brushes to amplify this effect and make the laning very difficult for her enemies."}
{"text": "As azir, When there is no team fight, get in a side lane and look to divide the lateral waves of thrust and firm. Look at what your team does in case you need to move to help them at all times. Delay team fights as long as possible while you try to harass the enemy with your long range and self-attacks. Use your ultimate defensive R in team fights. Use it to protect yourself and your allies from the enemy/assassin front line."}
{"text": "As ashe, Keep in mind your position when you are disassembled due to its W poke from Ashe. Avoid going for prolonged trades; instead, aim for automatic attack and then climb up quickly. After level 6, be careful on disassembly when Ashe has its ultimate (R) available. Keep the wave near your side as Ashe is squishy, making it vulnerable to the ganks of your jungler."}
{"text": "As ahri, Once you hit level 6, look for all-in opportunities with your Ultimate. You can also start roaming at this time.\n\nYou are vulnerable and immobile pre-level 6. Consistently keep an eye on your position and constantly pivot around the lane to avoid skill shots and incoming damage. Once you\u2019re level 6, you can start to play aggressive.\n\nFocus on surviving the early levels. Avoid going for risky trades, and avoid throwing out your E unless you\u2019re almost guaranteed to land it."}
{"text": "As viego, Once you get your base element, you should watch the enemy duel as much as possible. If the enemy plays too safe, wander another way. Helping your jungle should be really easy for you because of your E. Don't waste time on objective fighting, as you might be able to get a huge lead there. Your W will play a pivotal role during this phase of the game. Always make sure you land on a high priority target, as it can help you secure choices quickly."}
{"text": "As nocturne, It's really hard to play when the enemy team gathers together. Nocturne wants the enemies to split up so he can use his Ultimate a to pick them up. Nocturne is super squishy and gets blown up in the team fights quickly even with his s. This makes it difficult for him to fight unless he advances. It's very easy to fall back during the Nocturne game. If you take a lot of damage through a bad game, you won't be able to play aggressive in the way."}
{"text": "As lucian, Strong power peak at level two that allows him to throw an enemy down with his E, Q combo. This combined with his Passive and Invocative Spells can easily get him killed on a squishy target. Very good clear wave with his W, Q and Ultimate R. This makes him gain the really fast priority and he also helps secure goals with his Jungler. After six, he can practically an enemy with his combo while repositioning simultaneously with his E. His E also makes him quite slippery, which allows him to avoid the ganks with ease."}
{"text": "As camille, In the first few levels, play safe and avoid trading. Camille\u2019s very early game damage is rather weak, so you\u2019ll probably lose a trade vs an aggressive laner.\n\nOnce you\u2019re level 4, you can look to fight and punish the enemy. Play around the enemies abilities to make trading easier.\n\nTry your hardest to get kills with your Ultimate R. You can do this by requesting ganks or looking to roam and help the Mid laner. Just make sure you push the wave before leaving lane."}
{"text": "As tristana, Improper or reckless usage of her W can immediately get her killed due to how squishy she is. The enemy can try to move away from her to prevent her from getting her fully charged E off, which won\u2019t reset her W to facilitate an escape.\n\nHer E without her Q is quite ineffective during the early game as she won\u2019t have any form of external attack speed on her. If she uses it carelessly, the enemy can look for an engage on her.\n\nShe is quite useless if she happens to fall behind during the early game. She is reliant on items and without them, the game might as well be a 5 v 4 due to how ineffective she will be in the game."}
{"text": "As anivia, It can also increase its chances of surviving in the skirmishes. It is really versatile and can also block the enemy from entering some part of the map. With your Ultimate m, Anivia's seat power is incredibly strong. With a lot of mana, you can constantly push the enemy into the enemy tower and force them to stay in the way."}
{"text": "Against azir, Once Azir has taken his Nashor Dent, he will push the wave very quickly. Try to keep the wave as well as possible by matching his damage on the minion wave. If he uses a capability, you will need to use one too. The best time to fight Azir is when the W soldiers are down. That's because he will lack a lot of damage. Try to start fighting every time he doesn't have W soldiers available. After Azir touches level 6, he will have much more protection and can easily disengage thanks to his Ultimate R. While his Ultimate R is down, try to abuse cooldown and look for killers."}
{"text": "As janna, Keep the wave closer to your side of the way to force Janna to overextend, creating gank opportunities for your jungler. Consider investing in an early healing reduction element, as Janna's healing abilities can be quite powerful. Articles like Executor's Call or Bramble Vest can help reduce her healing effectiveness. Take advantage of Janna's positioning as she walks forward to harass your ADC. Move her with basic attacks and your Q while she is vulnerable. Keep in mind that Janna's Level 6 brings stronger 2v2 potential and team combat presence. Adjust your game style accordingly and be careful during these moments."}
{"text": "As rengar, Without his Ultimate R, he really can't gank effectively like a Jungler. Misuse of his W can get him killed during team fighting. It's because it's his main form of CC purifying and without it being really squishy. Vulnerable to silences and other CC abilities that can stop him in his tracks. If the enemy team manages to get him back on early, he can't make much of the whole game."}
{"text": "As garen, Garen\u2019s lack of CC makes it possible for the enemy to kite him till he falls back or overextends and dies. Since he lacks any form of ranged engagement potential, he is really weak against ranged enemy champions.\n\nHe relies on flanking the enemy team from the sidelines. If the enemy team manages to set the proper vision, Garen\u2019s game plan will collapse and he will be useless especially if your team managed to set him behind early on.\n\nDue to him having multiple builds, Garen\u2019s effectiveness can vary from game to game. If he decides to go for the full AD build when his team lacks a frontline, he won\u2019t be able to do anything that game if he is set back. This should be a proper signal for the enemy Jungler/team to camp him when possible."}
{"text": "As sett, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate R is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate R is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, At level 6, Seraphine will unlock her Ultimate R. This makes her more of a threat and she\u2019ll be able to set up her Jungler quite easily.\n\nSeraphine is good in team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Avoid grouping closely together so she is unable to get a strong Ultimate R off.\n\nOnce Seraphine has completed her first item, her Q damage will increase and so will her kill threat. Make sure you avoid getting hit by her Q\u2019s."}
{"text": "As ksante, In the late game, you would\u2019ve completed multiple items which makes you extremely tanky and hard to kill.\n\nAt level 16, you would\u2019ve put the third and final point in your Ultimate. The extra cooldown reduction will help you get picks with your team.\n\nAs you have lots of CC in your kit, you are good in team fights. In the late game, you will be grouping with your team and looking for fights as 5, so you\u2019re good at this stage too.\n"}
{"text": "As kayn, Kayn is not very early because its capabilities will not do much damage. It will have to play carefully and wait until it has access to all its basic capabilities before going for all in. Level 6 is a massive power peak that allows Kayn to strengthen its all-in-one potential. The additional damage of the burst will be beneficial when it comes to dealing with squishy or various targets. The first component will give Kayn a massive power peak as it will strengthen both its damage and survival. It will allow him to dull the enemies with ease."}
{"text": "As milio, As you are a Support, avoid dealing alone in the late game. If you are selected, the enemy will be able to take goals nearby or use their digital advantage to win a team fight. Constantly place the vision around the map to help your team secure goals and get choices. Having a vision around the Baron and Dragon is necessary to help your team win. In the late game, make sure you are with your team at any time. If you leave them, the enemy can start a fight without you being there to protect them and keep them alive."}
{"text": "As ahri, Focus on farming up and getting your Lost Chapter as quickly as you can. While using your Q, try to hit both the minions as well as the enemy to maximize the efficiency of this ability.\n\nYou are not very mobile before you get your Ultimate, so always keep a track of the enemy Jungler's position. Hug the wall opposite to the side where the enemy Jungler was last seen.\n\nOnce you unlock your Ultimate, it is time to begin roaming and securing kills elsewhere after shoving the wave in. Sometimes, the enemy laner may follow you. If they do this without vision, just hide in the Jungle and kill them when they walk too close to you."}
{"text": "Against shyvana, Shyvana will look for aggressive pieces and aggressive jobs early. Keep this in mind. Avoid pushing the wave constantly. Shyvana has great potential all-in and hunting. Keeping the wave closer to your side of the map will reduce her chances of running in the way. If you see that Shyvana has its Ultimate t, avoid all-in over-commitments as she might just escape. For example, don't Flash for her unless her Ultimate t is down."}

Clean up kills when possible but don't get too close to CC heavy champs else, you will definitely get killed.\n\nUse your E carefully in this phase of the game. The goal is to ensure that you never get caught off-guard by a skill shot that has the potential to CC you.\n\nYour W will come in very handy during this phase of the game. Stay in the backline and keep poking the enemies till your team all-ins them. Once the battle is done, go in for the cleanup kills.        "}
{"text": "As jhin, His Passive allows him to blow up squishies with ease. This can allow him to get a huge lead early on and then capitalize on it, and finish the game before key enemies come online.\n\nThe follow-up CC extension on his kit with his W and E is really strong. This is what makes him really good with champions who have hard CC or slows in their arsenal.\n\nHe can keep going for regular short trades with his auto-attacks and his Q. This will allow him to soften up his target without the help of his Support, and once they are low enough, he can all-in them. He becomes safer as he builds critical strike."}
{"text": "As maokai, A supertank who has a ton of CC built into his kit. He can act as a really good frontline for his team and can also peel targets from his carries.\n\nHis Ultimate R can allow him to set up engages from a great distance. This is extremely beneficial when used from out of vision, or when enemies are near a wall.\n\nProvides a lot of vision with his E, which also makes way for brush control. Combine his E slow with his W, he can practically hand pick a target and CC them for some time while his team just follows up on him."}
{"text": "Against camille, In team fighting, try to launch your Ultimate R when the enemy is assembled so that it can bounce between several champions and inflict more damage. Delay a team fighting as long as possible while you harass and push the enemy down with your W. Get as close to the enemy laner as you can before using your Q. The further you use it, the harder it will be for you to land it."}

When Hecarim completes Trinity Force, his duel power gets intensified."}

He should have an easy time clearing waves with it as well if he needs to recall.\n\nThe first item will be a massive power spike for Lucian as it allows him to deal a lot of damage.

The enemy can always react to Jax's games. He sends someone from their team to prevent him from separating from the push. They can even kill his entire team and then go for crucial goals like the Baron. Low against champions who are tidy and can kit him out of his Q range. This allows the enemy to get him out and then everything in him once he has been overthrown."}

{"text": "As ornn, Can buff up his team thanks to his Passive which allows him to upgrade his allies items.\n\nHis Ultimate R is a great tool that can set up his Jungler. It is also a good tool in 2v2 fights. Finally, it\u2019s great in team fights as it could potentially knock-up 5 enemies.\n\nOrnn scales incredibly well into the later parts of the game. He is one of the few champions who is relatively good at all stages of the game."}
{"text": "As sion, It is quite weak before touching level six. That's because it doesn't have much mobility, and enemies can easily get away from it if they have a vision of it. After six, Zion gets a decent peak of power as it gets a team struggle impacting Ultimate R. It allows it to ride around and the gangway other tracks as well. The first element will give a boost to its survival and overall damage. It will be able to use its Q from brushes to enemies CC and then follow it with damage to the rest of its abilities."}
{"text": "As rumble, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "As sejuani, She is kind of squishy during the early game, especially when her Passive is down. It is quite easy to lose that Passive so she needs to be careful.\n\nBesides her Ultimate R CC, her W E CC combo is quite hard to land due to the fact that the enemy can easily kite the combo out. Therefore, Sejuani needs to be really careful about her movement.\n\nCan\u2019t gank very effectively until she hits level six and gets her Ultimate R. This gives early aggressive Junglers an advantage over her which they can then capitalize on to shut her down."}
{"text": "As azir, The main goal is to get your first element quickly while making sure that you don't get CC'd and all-in'd. Use your W and r with the utmost discretion. Shove the wave when possible and punish the enemy launch with your self-directed soldier-attacks. It will slowly allow you to get a healthy lead in the path after which you can either look to all-in or roam. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should be able to do much more in this path. The plan is always the same, whip your enemy first, and then look all-in with your Ultimate R. Take the position of the enemy Jungler first into consideration."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Yuumi will heal a lot during this phase of the game. She will literally heal all the damage inflicted on her teammate, making prolonged team fights the way to go for her team. Yuumi will have a lot of articles finished during this stage. This means that she will have increased the statistics that will make her healing and mana regen really high. Killing her teammates will become really difficult now. Yuumi's strength will be shown during the team fights where she and her fed cart will be a death ball for the enemy team. All her abilities and added effects will create a raid boss, which the enemy team must defeat."}
{"text": "As senna, She is very motionless and can be killed easily if she is all-in-one. This can stop her during the early game and force her to play defensively. Her enemies can look at everything as soon as she misses her W, so she has to use this ability quite carefully. She will be more focused on getting her passive batteries in order to be able to carry later in the game. Invisibility E can be easily counterbalanced with a properly placed Control Ward. Her Q costs a lot of mana so and can make her run out of resources if she uses this ability in a carefree way."}
{"text": "As vayne, Avoid fighting at level 6. Force her to extend for the farm by keeping the wave of minions closer to your side of the map early on. Your goals in this matchup are to really just push her down and focus on agriculture. Expanded trades will work in her favor, so try to focus on agriculture."}
{"text": "As swain, Do not forget to take as many neutral and objective fights as possible. Your Ultimate R & E will help you massively with it. Since you will dive into the enemy team, you will want to get a defensive element like a Zhonya Hurglass. This will allow you to use your Ultimate R effectively. You will need to take care of your backline and see that they are not being subjugated and killed. If a murderer tries to kill them, E kills him immediately."}
{"text": "As ekko, At level 16, Ekkos Ultimate R will do a lot of damage and will be on a really short refreshment. He can look for incredibly aggressive games every time he's up. Several articles offer him low refreshments and lots of brilliant damage. Do not be afraid to go for the games. The teams will group closely in the end of the game. It's good for Ekko because it can allow him to get a multi-person W out and CC all the enemy team."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Her first back is when she will get her initial power spike. Till then, Miss Fortune should be playing safely and should just try to land her ricocheted t on enemies behind low health minions.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike as it allows Miss Fortune to impact fights massively. It is also a decent finishing move, especially in clumped fights.\n\nHer first item component will increase her dueling potential significantly. Her ability to dish out damage in the lane will also skyrocket.        "}
{"text": "As kassadin, Powerfarm in the middle of the game. You have to win as much gold and XP as possible so you can level quickly. Avoid fighting too much in the middle of the game. It is better for you to fight only when it will work in your favor. Focus on agriculture rather than fighting."}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, Depending on the level you take your W your first power peak is when you touch level 3 or 4. While the W won=t helps you in 1v1 fights during the laning phase, it will allow you to help your Jungler if they need you for a potential early scuttle crab fight. Once Aurelion Sol has finished its first element, it can look for more favorable exchanges with the enemy. While around your W, you should bring down the enemy and then commit to an all-in-one once they are low. Aurelion Sol=s main peak of sound power at level 6 when it unlocks its Ultimate. It offers it a lot of additional damage and can be used in conjunction with its E to CC enemy. It also helps it in roaming."}
{"text": "As seraphine, Level 6 is a decent powerpike because Seraphine will get her Ultimate R and can now change the tide of a fight if the enemy team is piled together or standing in a line. The first element increases its damage and allows it to use its abilities a little more frequently. She is still mana-hungry, so she will have to pay attention to spamming spells."}
{"text": "As zac, The level 6 of Zac is a decent peak of power for team fighting and duel. It will allow it to move key targets while also inflicting damage that can be very beneficial when facing low-health or squishy targets. Adding more points in its W will allow Zac to inflict more damage in the long term. This is beneficial in the upper track as it inflicts health damage in maximum percentage, and the upper track is usually occupied by high HP targets. The first element will give Zac a lot of power and survival in the track. It will also have access to the track brushes, which will provide him with the element of surprise, and the enemy will have to play with a constant fear of being absolutely."}
{"text": "As neeko, This is especially true if it goes for AD construction. Can't be very effective if the enemy puts the right vision around and can notice Neeko changing its shapes or hiding in a brush to land its E. Due to its thrust power, it can be very sensitive to ganks especially after using its W."}
{"text": "As gragas, Gragas\u2019s Ultimate R is very good in team fights. It deals a lot of damage and can displace the whole enemy team.\n\nHe has good sustain in lane (compared to many other champions) with his W. This will allow him to look for trades more frequently and heal back after a trade.\n\nHis E can be used in conjunction with Flash to get surprise trades/engages off with the enemy. He can also use it to interrupt abilities and enemy dashes."}
{"text": "Against sona, Once Sona reaches level 6, her death pressure increases and she can start playing more aggressively. In addition, her Ultimate R offers her additional gank configuration, so expect her Jungler gank post 6. Her healing of her W will be a problem as the game unfolds. Make sure your team invests in Execution."}
{"text": "Against ornn, Ornn has the ability to hit enemies who are close to his Q, terrain and walls. Avoid fighting in the jungle as it will allow him to land easily. In team fights, avoid regrouping too closely because Ornn can use his Ultimate R to get a multi-person and start the team fight. Avoid fighting in the jungle because the teams will be close enough together which allows him to hit several champions at once."}
{"text": "As camille, A good Camille will be able to play around her Ultimate R regularly. Once you have a second point in it, you should be able to get more killers with it. Make sure you constantly look for the coins every time your Ultimate R is up. At level 9, you will maximize your Q. At this stage of the game, your potential 1v1 is incredibly high. Don=t be afraid to look for 1v1 fights. You will have several completed elements in the middle of the game. After your first article, you will be much stronger, and when you have 2, you will be a fierce opponent."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Use the lane brushes and keep poking enemies with your E. The goal is to get as many Fear procs as you can in this lane without taking much damage in return.\n\nYour effigies should help you massively when it comes to setting up vision around the map. Ensure that the lane entrances are warded and that you keep poking the enemy relentlessly.\n\nOnce you get your Ultimate R, your team fight impact should increase massively. Use the effigies and bamboozle enemies with surprise Ultimate R's on them.        "}
{"text": "As nunu, Always stay out of sight and try to run your lane down with your W and E. It should let you cut them massively and probably kill them soon too. Once you unlock your Ultimate R, you should be able to all enemies with ease. Set up almost neutral objective death brushes to maximize the effect. Although you are not the Jungler, your Q will always be extremely valuable when it comes to winning."}
{"text": "Against irelia, Avoid trading with Irelia when she has her passive piled up as she will take you out. Keep an eye on the small bar under her health. When trading with Irelia, keep an eye on the weak health minions in your way. Irelia can use her Q on the minion to escape the trade or crush you after a skirmish. Irelia benefits from prolonged trades. Try and avoid going for prolonged trades with her as she will always win them."}
{"text": "Against garen, Garen deals a surprising amount of damage in the early game. Stay at max range to make it harder for him to get an early kill or get on to you and kill you.\n \nAt level 6, Garen will gain access to his Ultimate R which can be used to execute enemies. Do not fight him when low, and definitely recall if you\u2019re below 50% health as he might look for a trade. It\u2019s better to be safe rather than try and fight and give him a kill.\n \nOnce Garen has completed his first item, he will be more obnoxious and looking to trade more and more. Keep this in mind and do not commit to fights with him alone."}
{"text": "As jax, Jax will have his e maxed at level thirteen. This will allow him to inflict more damage with an increased frequency that is quite beneficial when dealing with peaks. Jax will have most of his articles and will be able to inflict a lot of damage now. Anyone in his range of jumps will die if they have no form of mobility spell on them. Jax will have a lot of articles during this phase of the game. This will help him kill enemies with ease as his Passive will allow him to do a lot of damage in a concise time."}
{"text": "As trundle, Trundle's early game ganks are pretty good as he can increase his overall movement speed and obstruct the escape route of the enemy he is targeting,\n\nLevel 6 is a massive power spike as it allows him to temporarily steal stats from his target. The stronger the enemy target, the better it is for Trundle.\n\nThe first item component will allow him to boost his dueling potential and survivability in the game. He needs to ensure that he constantly ganks and gets himself ahead during the early game.        "}
{"text": "As jayce, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them otherwise the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you\u2019re away from your team.\n\nUse your s to harass the enemy as much as possible before committing to the team fight. Getting them low first will make it easier for you to win the fight.\n\nPeel for your carries and focus the nearest enemy champion if you\u2019re weak. If you\u2019re ahead, focus the backline and try to take them down instead."}
{"text": "As camille, In the first levels, play safely and avoid trading. Camille is very early game damage is quite weak, so you're probably going to lose a trade vs an aggressive laner. Once you're level 4, you can look to fight and punish the enemy. Play around enemy abilities to facilitate trading. Try your toughest to get killed with your Ultimate R. You can do it by asking for ganks or looking to wander and help the Mid laner. Just make sure you push the wave before leaving the track."}
{"text": "Against urgot, Do not fight with Urgot at level 1 because he will have all his gun knees ready and he can quickly bring your life to zero if he can take them all. Try to avoid Urgots Q and E in the laning phase. They both have long cooldowns and you should chat with him when they are down for a better chance of going out ahead. Try to stay more than 25% healthy at all times. This will increase your chances of winning the way and surviving. If you are lower than that, he can just use his E, auto once and then you end up with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As lux, Avoid detaching from your ally when Lux's Q (Light Binding) ability is available to minimize the risk of getting caught in her crowd control.\n\nDuring levels 1 and 2, focus on poking Lux as much as possible with your basic attacks to apply pressure and potentially gain an advantage.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your side of the lane to create opportunities for jungle assistance and have a longer lane to chase down Lux and her ADC if needed.\n\nWhen poking Lux, position yourself behind at least two minions to block the damage from her Q ability, reducing the effectiveness of her poke."}
{"text": "As blitzcrank, Every time Blitzcranks b is on cooldown, it has very little pressure on the track and is very vulnerable. Use your b only if you are sure you will land it. Blitzcrank has a strong roaming potential, but it is important that you don't leave your ADC alone if they're going to die. Communication is the key when you want to wander on Blitzcrank. Just like his b cooldown, every time Blitzcrank is weak on the mana, it has a minimal threat because he won't be able to use his basic combo. Make sure you still have enough mana to use your b & t at any given time."}
{"text": "As lissandra, If they randomly use their dash ability, try to abuse the cooldown by playing aggressive and going for favourable trades.\n\nDon\u2019t let Lissandra harass and poke you down. If you lose a lot of health, you\u2019ll never be in a position to play aggressively. Watch your positioning, dodge Lissandra's damage and don\u2019t let them abuse you for free.\n\nYou\u2019re weaker than them whenever they have their Ultimate up. If you\u2019re at risk of dying, always recall at level 5 so you do not get killed when they hit level 6.\n\nJust let Lissandra push you into your tower. She has a lot of counter play potential, so just let her push and wait for ganks.\n"}
{"text": "As aurelionsol, At level 9, Aurelion will max his 1st ability. This is a very good power spike for him as it will allow him to dish out more damage, and clear waves easier.\n\nDuring the mid-game, Aurelion Sol should\u2019ve completed multiple items. He should be able to dish out a lot of damage in team fights with his Ultimate and Passive.\n\nLevel 11 is another good power spike for Aurelion Sol because he gets to put a second point in his Ultimate."}
{"text": "As lux, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in the way. You have a lot of poke, so try poke the enemy as often as you can. Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your l. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Very squishy and can be easily burst down when his E is down. Junglers can camp him at that stage as well since he will have no other form of escape left, and his E has a very long cooldown.\n\nTakes quite some time to scale up due to how his itemization works. This is also dependent on the fact that he is very skill shot heavy and will need to land his Qs on the enemy in order to be effective.\n\nBuffering his E won\u2019t work too well if the enemy has some form of ranged CC which they can use to follow-up on Ezreal after he has used his E. This forces him to play a bit more defensively, and he won\u2019t be able to push in the wave either, else he can get run down by the enemy."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Very squishy and immobile when his E is down. If you waste your E, the enemy has time to go in.\n\nBuffering your E can be extremely difficult against certain champions. It will often leave beginners in a sticky situation.\n\nHe is mechanically a very difficult champion. While he\u2019s easy to pick up, he is hard to master."}
{"text": "As maokai, A supertank who has a ton of CC built into his kit. He can act as a really good frontline for his team and can also peel targets from his carries.\n\nHis Ultimate R can allow him to set up engages from a great distance. This is extremely beneficial when used from out of vision, or when enemies are near a wall.\n\nProvides a lot of vision with his E, which also makes way for brush control. Combine his E slow with his W, he can practically hand pick a target and CC them for some time while his team just follows up on him."}
{"text": "As pyke, If you miss your Ultimate R, you will miss potential resets and you will definitely miss the gold and damage. Try your hardest to know who has Flash and who does not increase your chances of landing your Q. It is a mechanically difficult champion to learn and will take a lot of time to get used to. Expect to put in a lot of work trying to learn it. Unfortunately, Pyke has nothing to offer when her Q is down."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Your goal is to hide in the fog of the war during the team fights and then get a massive CC from the enemy team. Fighting around the bottlenecks should be very fruitful for you. Roll around when possible as your Ultimate R, E, and Q should compensate for some easy ganks during this phase of the game. Work with your Jungler to invade the enemy Jungle and secure the peaks. Work with your Jungler and set up death brushes whenever you can. This will help you a lot in this game because your Active Q is really too powerful in case of people bursting."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand is also one of the champions who dies the most in the game! As Brand is a poke mage, it counts a lot on mana and can run low quite quickly and it will be unable to use his aggressive W if it is out of mana. You must always keep an eye on your mana pool at any time. In addition to being quite still, Brand is also quite squishy. It is really important that you don't let the enemy poke you down or land poke that you will have to play passively. You will also need to play much safer when your Flash is down."}
{"text": "As lucian, Very vulnerable when his E is down which can allow him to be very susceptible to ganks. Enemy Junglers can take this opportunity to camp him relentlessly.\n\nReliant on items to win the game. If he is set back during the early game, he won\u2019t be able to do a lot in the late game as he just falls off.\n\nIf he manages to get an early lead, he may be able to snowball if left unchecked. He falls off massively though so the longer the game goes, the worse it is for Lucian."}
{"text": "As hwei, In the late game, you would\u2019ve completed multiple items and got a lot of levels under your belt. You will be strong in the late game, too.\n\nAt level 16, you\u2019ll put the final point in your Ultimate, giving your Ultimate a shorter cooldown and increasing your chances of getting picks.\n\nStick with your team in the late game! Hwei is excellent in late-game fights, thanks to his AOE abilities and late-game damage output.\n"}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, When Xin Zhao hits level 6, his all-in pressure intensifies. He may look for an aggressive play as soon as he gets the level up.\n\nWhen Xin has brought his first component item, he will be really strong in 1v1 skirmishes. Keep this in mind when trying to fight him.\n\nXin is very good in the mid-game. Expect him to frequently look for plays around the map, or look to kill you over and over again."}
{"text": "As azir, The danger increases when you don't have your ultimate R ready. Because of your soldier positioning mechanic, any enemy champion who has a dash, or other form of mobility spell, can turn out to be a really hard target to catch and kill for you. Your own mobility can prove to be a weak point for you. If the enemy manages to bait your R in an aggressive way and then the enemy Jungler shows up for a gank, you will have a really hard time getting out of the situation without your ultimate R."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan's level 2 all-in is pretty good. Once it unlocks both its d and e, it can look for a favorable business. Depending on its construction path, it can either do a lot of damage, be incredibly tanky, or offer its team a lot of utility. Everything depends on its construction! This makes Jarvan incredibly versatile. Its Ultimate m is really good in team fighting because it can lock several enemy champions at once."}
{"text": "As kalista, Stay with your Support throughout the middle of the game. If you get away from them, you'll be an easy target for the enemy. Make sure you're always close to at least 1 ally. Group and stay with your team at all times. Do not divide the thrust or avoid grouping unless you have a good reason to be away from them. Look for choices with your Support/Jungler to get killed and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As samira, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. However, you will rely on your Support to do the heavy lifting early on. \n\nAfter destroying the bottom lane tower, rotate to the mid lane and try to take that tower. This will open up the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As xerath, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or get away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for choices with your abilities. Choosing someone and then collapsing on them to remove them is a great way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for choices on isolated targets if possible. Keep a constant eye on you and your allies position. You need to drop the enemy and delay the fights in the late game, but you need to look at your positioning as you move forward to harass."}
{"text": "Against leona, Avoid fighting in areas like the jungle or around the Dragon/ Baron pit as it will allow Leona to get a really good Ultimate e off. Try and spread out and fight in a lane if possible.\n\nWhen fighting, try not to group too closely as it will give Leona a really good Ultimate e and stun multiple people. Split up so she can only CC 1 or 2 people at best.\n\nLeona is prone to poke and disengage. As soon as she tries to engage, try to disengage and create distance between you and her. Additionally, try to harass and poke her down with long-ranged abilities to make it suicidal for her to engage."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Look for extended trades whenever possible. Gragas relies heavily on his ability to inflict damage, but if they are on the cooldown, he can really do nothing except self-attack. Go for prolonged trades when one of his abilities is down. Gragas can tease a engagement when his Body Slam E is standing. Try and stand behind or near the minions at any time. However, do not stand too close to them since the ability has an AOE and if you are close to them, you will be hit by his E. If Gragas uses his W, it is because he wants to do something like set up his Jungler or go for a job. Play safer for a short period of time when he uses his W."}
{"text": "As ekko, After your bot lane has moved to the mid lane, rotate to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to farm and gain XP. \n\nFlank in team fights with your W and E to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast.\n\nAs you\u2019re good at getting picks and killing isolated targets, try to ambush and assassinate enemies who are alone or walking around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby objective."}
{"text": "As leesin, Once you get two items, you should be able to flatten a lot of damage depending on the construction you go for. Just make sure that you use your e appropriately to avoid CC. Try looking for peaks around the map. Your kit allows you to duel them easily and escape if a fight goes wrong. Try to catch the ADC enemy in a side track or the enemy Support while they are in custody. Your main goal during the fighting will be to reach the most priority enemy target and then move them to your team with your Ultimate k. Playing around the vision will be really important to achieve this goal."}
{"text": "As nocturne, If you want to fight him, you need to bait out his W first or else he will just win the 1v1.\n\nPost 6, don\u2019t steal his Ultimate, as it will not help you much in the 1v1 against him.\n\nHe is a stronger early-game Jungler than you.

{"text": "Against warwick, Warwick is very weak early and will focus on agriculture and survive the game very early. At level 6, Warwick will be much stronger. Its ultimate R is an excellent tool to start fighting, look for roarings and much more. Remember when weak so it doesn't kill you. Warwick is weak early, but strong in the later parts of the laning phase once it has some levels and items under its belt."}
{"text": "As ekko, His W allows him to engage upon a group or enemy champions, or a single enemy champion with ease. This is really beneficial if he can land it from out of vision and then use his E to dash into the W circle to guarantee the stun.\n\nHis burst damage is not to be ignored as the game goes on. This is especially true when he happens to be ahead in the game. He can quite literally take the enemy backline out in one rotation of spells, if he manages to W E onto them.\n\nHis Ultimate R is the most powerful ability in his kit as it allows him to undo his mistakes, especially when he chooses a bad fight or fails an all-in. As the game goes on, the cooldown of this ability becomes shorter, allowing him to do whatever he pleases as long as he has his Ultimate R up."}
{"text": "As reksai, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies ahead. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure you try to exploit your early advantage.\n\nLook to secure objectives whenever they\u2019re up. This will give your team an advantage as the game goes along.\n\nFind a healthy balance between ganking your allies, farming your jungle and securing objectives. Make sure you do not fall behind in XP by trying to constantly gank."}
{"text": "Against karma, Delaying a team fight will allow him to harass your team and make the fight much more risky. If Karma uses her self-appointed Q while trying to poke, you should use the cooldown to start a team fight. When Karmas Ultimate is downstairs, she can't give her team a huge shield that will make the fight much easier. Don't be afraid to invest in an execution call. This will reduce her healing and shielding and it will make the victory of the team fight much easier."}
{"text": "As quinn, Once again, Quinn does not really point to level 16 as his Ultimate R is a utility tool rather than a tool of pure damage. Quinn starts to fall into the later parts of the game as the enemies will buy items that offer them additional protection against his damage. Fortunately, the more Quinn articles gets, more than one problem it will be for the enemy team. As long as she is looking for choices with her team, she should agree in the end of the game."}
{"text": "As corki, When Corki has completed his first item, his wave clear and poke damage will increase heavily. He shouldn\u2019t find it hard at all to keep the enemy pushed into their tower once he completes it.\n\nAt level 6, Corki\u2019s wave clear increases as his e can help him push the enemy into their tower. His  e are also a good tool to poke and push the wave simultaneously. \n\nHe is not neccessarily strong at levels 1-4, but he does have his basic attacks, and his Passive which make him abit annoying to deal with if you're playing as a melee champion against him."}
{"text": "As urgot, Very strong level one due to his shotgun knees. He can 100 to 0 any enemy champion by running circles around them if they are careless, and get an early lead.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to be an excellent tank buster during late-game fights. It also acts as a great finisher from a large range, especially on unsuspecting enemies.\n\nHis early game is quite strong which is only increased once he gets his Ultimate R. The strength also increases once he manages to get his first two items."}

Make sure you prioritise taking those objectives whenever you can, as it will give your team a big lead.\n\nYou are a good counter-ganker.

Before using your t to kill Mordekaiser, silence him with your m to prevent him from protecting the damage with his W and possibly avoid death, prevent you from winning a pile of your passive t. Play around Mordekaiser, and only engage when he's down. Otherwise, you'll have problems trying to bypass him due to a lack of mobility in your kit, and get dragged into a fight you're running away from. At level 6, Mordekaiser can force you to fight with his R. Be ready for that at any time you're trading, because he can quickly become a Mordekaiser all-in."}
{"text": "Against fizz, When playing as a melee champion, do not go for extended trades with Fizz as he will always come out ahead thanks to his W.\n\nUnless you benefit from any other wave manipulation, try and keep the wave even or closer to your side. This prevents him from engaging on you or chasing you down.\n\nFizz has insane roaming potential. Do not blindly follow him as he can easily turn around and kill you. Instead, communicate with your team while following him from a distance if possible."}
{"text": "As elise, Careless usage of her E can get her killed on multiple occasions. She can\u2019t avoid important CC abilities without this ability and hence she will need to use it properly to make sure that an all-in goes well.\n\nHer Q works differently based on her form. Using the wrong form at the wrong point can prevent her from getting a kill while buying precious time for the enemy to collapse on her.\n\nHer Blue buff is very important for her. Stealing it away during the early game will prevent her from being able to cast her abilities frequently, which will ultimately allow the enemy Jungler to invade her easily."}

{"text": "As annie, Annie is a team combat champion thanks to the AOE on Tibbers R. As the teams will begin to regroup in the middle of the game, it is plausible that she can land on a multi-person stun with him. When she has 2 points in her Ultimate R, she will be able to look for more aggressive pieces around the card. She will also be able to use her Flash to get choices. She will put the second point in her Ultimate R at level 11. Annies E will be on a shorter cooldown during the middle of the game. It's good for her and her ADC because she will be able to protect them more frequently in mid-game team fights."}
{"text": "As fiora, In the team fights, try to flank the side to make it harder for the enemy to disengage or fall. If you get shot down, you won't be able to engage and you'll probably die.

{"text": "As kayle, Stay away from your team and look at the farm and win as many XPs as possible. You need to hit your level peaks as quickly as possible and one way to do so is to stay on a side track. Focus on agriculture and avoid fighting in the middle of the game. If you die or have to burn your Flash, you will be incredibly vulnerable. Split push and stay away from your team unless they need you. You will be stronger if you avoid fighting and grouping unless you have to do it."}
{"text": "Against kled, Kled will always be stronger when he is mounted. He is slightly weaker when he is disassembled. At level 6, Kled has increased mobility and the potential to impact several tracks with his Ultimate R. He can also use his Ultimate R to engage and pursue the enemy. Do not overextend in the way as he can easily kill you. Kled is one of the strongest champions in the game. He will try to fight you as much as he can to get an early lead."}

When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to cultivate during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done. Avoid overextension or die alone.

Try to bring down the enemy as much as possible while your team tries to take turns (or the Dragon or Baron)."}
{"text": "As vi, Vi has an excellent selection potential with its Ultimate R. The range allows it to catch out-of-guard enemies with its Ultimate R and to kill its targets due to its bursting damage. Vi's objective control will always be preserved during this phase of the game. This means that it can quickly melt through the rounds with its E and take neutral goals with ease. Its impact will be massive during the middle of the game. That's because it will have its basic elements, and it will be able to choose the enemies with ease with its Ultimate R. It can easily flank the enemy and reach their backline."}

Once he gets more items, this ability will help him kill enemies with ease, and he can take over the game with his scaling.\n\nJax isn't very strong early on as he is quite item reliant. He should be focusing on farming and short skirmishes to clean up kills. Neutral objective fights are situations where he can capitalize on this objective."}

{"text": "As lux, Its e will allow it to peel several porters at the same time. The shield will be powerful, so that it will really work well against assassination attempts.

He can also use it to help teammates finish off targets while roaming around.\n\nHis Q is really obnoxious, and it just becomes more potent as he keeps adding points to that ability.

You\u2019ll need to make sure you can push the wave back so you don\u2019t lose your Tower early. \n\nNeeko is good in team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Disengage as soon as you see her channel her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus is a heavy farm champion and will have to absorb many wave minions and jungle camps to be useful throughout the game. His Ultimate e basically does not inflict any damage in early play. This is not good for Karthus because he only wants to use it when the enemy is super low. Meanwhile, the enemy could have already been killed by your ally, and you wouldn't get any help. Channeling your Ultimate e near an enemy champion could be very dangerous as they could interrupt the channel with CC."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Hard engagement is the best way to deal with Ezreal during the laning phase. But you will need to wait for him to use his E if your CC is a skill shot. Ezreals poke damage starts to stack if you take too many Qs in the face. Make sure you are still standing behind the minion wave at all times. In team fights, you must not let Ezreal fall before you have the chance to engage. If it is isolated, run on it as fast as you can to start the fight. Do not delay team fights against an Ezreal."}
{"text": "As yuumi, To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on which major goal is the next spawning. If it quickly spawns, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and safely as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the major goals is the key. Look for choices during the middle of the game. If you can choose someone with the help of your allies, you can abuse their death timer to win more gold and eventually take a turn, goal or get more dead."}
{"text": "As volibear, A low R Ultimate cooldown means that he can fight as a team frequently. He will also increase his overall selection potential, making the team fights unfair for the enemy team. Volibear is really tanky during the last games of the game. It becomes difficult to get him down, even with Grievous Wounds. Volibear starts to fall during the end of the game. He will now function as a reliable front-liner as a real duel to protect his portages."}
{"text": "As twitch, Search for extended trades early. Twitchs damage in the game early is strong enough if it can get a long trade long down. After it picks up its first component element, Twitchs trading power increases considerably. It will be a huge problem for the enemy if it can sneak on them with its s. At level 6, Twitch can go for scary trades with the enemy. Additional statistics that it gets from its Ultimate c will help him get murders with its ADC."}
{"text": "As tristana, Tristana can play aggressive from level 2/3 onwards. If she can get some poke down at level 1, she can force the enemy to blow Flash or use their consumables if she plays aggressively at level 2.\n\nAt level 6, Tristana\u2019s burst damage increases dramatically. This combined with her E and basic attacks, she can easily blow up the enemy laner.\n\nWhen Tristana completes her first component item, her damage output will increase and it will make it a lot easier for her to secure CS and gold.\n"}
{"text": "As missfortune, The first major power peak of Miss Fortune is once she has reached level 4/5. It is because she would have put several points in her t that can cause a lot of damage to an enemy squishy. When Miss Fortune has completed her first component element, her damage output will increase considerably and she can easily blow up the enemy when she has more levels under her belt. At level 6, Miss Fortune will unlock her Ultimate e. This in conjunction with her t will bring a lot of damage to the enemy in a short period of time."}
{"text": "As sona, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}
{"text": "As malzahar, Malzahar\u2019s first major power spike is when he gets his first component item. It will allow him to spam his abilities on the enemy laners. \n\nWhen Malzahar hits level 6, he can look for picks and set up kills for his ADC or the Jungler.\n\nDuring the early game, Malzahar should try to use his Ultimate R whenever he can. Using it as soon as it comes up will help his lane get more kills and start a snowball.\n"}
{"text": "As fiora, At level 11, Fiora\u2019s Ultimate R will be much better. Putting a second point in her Ultimate R is vital and her 1v1 kill pressure increases.\n\nFiora is good in the mid-game and will be looking to split push. She should be able to draw a lot of attention for her team so they can get stuff done elsewhere like the Dragon or Baron.\n\nAt level 9, Fiora will max out her Q. This is a very important power spike for her as it will allow her to look for more aggressive plays, help her farm and also help her escape sticky situations thanks to the low cooldown."}
{"text": "Against leesin, Lee Sin will be trying to gank as often as he can in the early game. He is a strong duelist and will look to abuse his early game strength.\n\nOnce Lee Sin is level 6, his kill pressure intensifies as his Ultimate k can be used to set up ganks or finish enemies off. He is very strong at level 6.\n\nAs soon as Lee Sin has completed his jungling item, his kill pressure will be very high as he will have lower cooldowns and more damage."}
{"text": "As cassiopeia, While it can dry a lot of damage at levels 1 and 2, it becomes much stronger when it has access to its basic capabilities. The next major power peak for Cassiopeias is when it unlocks its Ultimate R. Its Ultimate R is very versatile and can be used either to engage or disengage from a fight. It can also be used to set up its Jungler. Cassiopeias will start doing much more damage in the trades when they took their first item."}
{"text": "As ekko, At level 16, Ekko\u2019s Ultimate R will deal a lot of damage and be on a really short cooldown. He can look for insanely aggressive plays whenever it is up.\n\nMultiple items offer him low cooldowns and a lot of burst damage. Don\u2019t be afraid to go for plays.\n\nTeams will group closely in the late game. This is good for Ekko because it can allow him to get a multi-person W off and CC the whole of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late-game team fights.\n\nTo make getting on the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay off to the side. If you flank from an unwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid splitting or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you\u2019re gone.\n\nPlay around your Ultimate R in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting without it will make the late-game team fights much harder. Delay fights and be prepared to disengage if it\u2019s still on cooldown."}
{"text": "As jayce, Staying with your team in the late game. Do not separate or move away from them otherwise the enemy can try to withdraw you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Use your s to harass the enemy as much as possible before engaging in the team fight."}
{"text": "As lux, Really good burst potential with her entire g, l, Ultimate n combo. This can delete a squishy enemy with ease starting from level six itself.\n\nHer e shield is deceptively strong as it can allow her to save all her team members from a lot of poke. This is also applicable when she is Support.\n\nHer g can be used to secure picks inside the enemy Jungle or from blind areas. This can be extremely beneficial if the picked target happens to be the enemy Jungler or the ranged carry."}
{"text": "As kled, Taking someone quickly will give you a huge advantage. As the enemy gets in position and prepares to group, someone can be isolated or alone (or they can be too far ahead). Pull on the trigger and use your ultimate R to collapse on them. Look to group your team in the last game. Regrouping is important because you won't be able to impact the team fights if you're far from them- even with your ultimate R because it takes some time to get in position."}
{"text": "As shen, Keep poking Shen with your abilities while he is farming, but make sure that you don't get CC'd by him while doing so.\n\nTry to keep your resource bar more than half filled as much as possible. It will help you when dealing with unprecedented all-ins.\n\nIf Shen ults to some other lane to help his allies, you should just focus on pushing and taking as many plates as possible from his tower.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Once you have destroyed the lower lane tower, move to the middle lane and try to take this goal too. Try to harass and poke the enemy as often as you can with your Q. Using your abilities will often allow you to stack your Lane quickly too. Getting it stacked in the middle of the game is crucial. Try your best to stay with your Support as much as possible in the late game. If you are weak, don't leave their side otherwise you will be an easy target."}
{"text": "Against sion, Sion can surprise the targets that walk around the Rift Invocation alone while waiting in a bush and using its Q to shoot them down. Avoid walking in areas where you know that Sion has been so much harder for you to get caught by him. Kite and disengagement is Sion is the biggest threat in a team fight. Try to keep him away from your team so that he is unable to get a good Q knockup. Avoid regrouping and fighting in the jungle as it will allow Sion to get a very good knockup with his Q or get a very good Ultimate Roff. Group together, but not stand on each other so he is unable to get a multi-person knockup."}
{"text": "As xinzhao, Having three points in his Ultimate R is a massive powerpike for Xin Zhao. This will allow him to use the ability frequently, giving him a global advantage during the fights. Xin will have two of his capabilities maximized by level 14. It is a significant boost to his duel power, and he will let him dominate 1 v 1's with the greatest ease. During this phase of the game, Xin will be truly tanky while simultaneously inflicting a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that it will be difficult to remove, and still or CC'd mainly carries death if they can't get Xin away from them."}
{"text": "Against missfortune, Once Miss Fortune hits level 6, her kill pressure increases thanks to her Ultimate e and its damage. \n\nIn team fights, Miss Fortune truly shines as her Ultimate e can deal tons of damage if she uses it in a safe place. Disengage as soon as she channels her Ultimate e. \n\nAt level 9, Miss Fortune\u2019s t will deal tons of damage if it hits you. Watch your positioning and make sure you\u2019re never directly behind a minion."}
{"text": "As azir, Azir does not have a peak at level 11 unlike many champions. Keep this in mind during the middle of the game that his Ultimate R can be less impacted compared to the other champions on the flaw. At level 9, Azir goes to max his r. It is a good peak of power for him because he can use it to bring down the enemy from afar. In conjunction with his W, he should be able to poke and farm from afar without dying to the enemy. When Azir completes several articles, he will be very strong and deposit a lot of damage in a short time."}
{"text": "As ahri, In the late game, you should be close to max build. You should be able to go down easily any champion you could contact with. Set up ambushes and look to blow up an unexpected enemy. Once you have level 16, you will have 3 points in your Ultimate. You can look for more aggressive games and look for spikes on extended targets. It will be on a cool lowdown in the late game, so don't be afraid to go for risky peaks as you can use it to escape if you miss your E. Ahri falls into the late game as the enemy will be healthier, and most champions will buy defensive items to protect them. It is unlikely that you will be able to blow up any first line champion, but you can quite easily remove the enemy Support or ADC."}
{"text": "Against soraka, You can abuse this by trying to lure her while she's guarding a goal. While she's dead, you can force a fight or take a goal with the advantage of numbers. Invest in an executor, Calling or Morellonomicon if your champion takes advantage of it. This will reduce Soraka, the healing potential of her W and Ultimate R to help you win the team fight. As Soraka will be positioned in the backline, it will be difficult for you to get her down quickly. To kill her more easily, try to flank her side rather than run straight to her in a team fight."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ensure that you\u2019re always stood behind a minion at all times to make it harder for him to land his Q and poke you down. \n \nThe best time to go for trades and land skill shots on Ezreal is when his E is on cooldown. If he ever uses it aggressively, try to abuse the cooldown and look for an aggressive play while he\u2019s defenceless. \n \nIf Ezreal uses his Ultimate R to snipe someone on the map, ping your team as it moves across Summoners Rift. This will allow them to dodge the incoming ability. While this ability is on cooldown, you could look to play aggressive and try to fight him."}
{"text": "As camille, Keep looking for choices as much as possible. Stay with your team however, as you do not want to enter without them. Due to your low cooldown on your Ultimate in the end of the game, make sure to actively search for games and isolate the enemy carriers. Stay with your team at all times, and peel and protect for your allies."}
{"text": "As olaf, Your goal in the early game is to gank as often as possible to get your allies forward. You are a strong early game Jungler, so make sure to try to exploit your early advantage. Look to secure the goals as often as possible. This will give your team an advantage as the game unfolds. Find a healthy balance between the ganking of your allies, farming your jungle and securing goals. Make sure you don't fall back in XP trying to gank constantly."}
{"text": "As naafiri, As suggested, she is a snowball heavy champion, so if you do not get an early lead, it will be hard to carry later on.\n\nShe suffers against teams that are smart and group together. It makes it riskier for you to go in alone, and you need your allies to go in with you.\n\nShe can be kited pretty well after she has gone in. It can be hard to handle champions with dashes or escape tools.\n"}
{"text": "As sett, Split push during the mid-game and try to secure side objectives. Avoid grouping if possible.\n\nUse your strong duelling potential in the mid-game to fight and duel anyone who tries to stop you from split pushing. \n\nAlthough you\u2019re a really strong split pusher in the mid-game, be prepared to group with your team and fight 5v5. You should usually start grouping when there are no nearby objectives to take."}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, You will naturally push the wave of minions with your Turrets Q. As you push, keep a constant eye on the map. Heimer is vulnerable to ganks if he doesn't have 3 Turrets Q up, so keep this in mind. If the enemy's lantern wanders, don't try to challenge their roam. Instead, push the wave of minions and start winning the gold of the turret plate."}
{"text": "Against shen, Shen is strong at level 6 as he gets global map pressure with his Ultimate R. Ping as soon as he gets his Ultimate R.\n\nShen\u2019s level 2 and 3 can be quite strong. If he is in a favourable matchup, it\u2019s not impossible for him to look for an early all-in.\n\nKeep an eye on Shen\u2019s items as his damage output increases depending on the order of the items he buys."}
{"text": "As nunu, This is a tank versus tank matchup. Your best bet is to just avoid them and focus on farming early.\n\nHowever, they are a stronger ganker than you in the early game, so be prepared to counter-gank and track them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get a lead from easy ganks, try to invade their jungle and steal away their camps.\n\nPost 6, look to make plays and gank your allies whenever your Ultimate is up. It heavily increases your kill pressure.\n"}
{"text": "As kled, Kled's Passive is heavily underrated, but that will make all the difference in the game now. He can use it to soak up so much damage without the risk of dying, and he can quickly remount if Skaarl flees.\n\nKled will have his build almost completed by now. This means that he will be tanky, as well as dish out heavy amounts of damage. Anyone who gets caught out by him will probably end up dying.\n\nSince all his abilities will be maxed at this point, Kled will be huge in the game. His ability to disrupt the enemy teams' ranks will be phenomenal, and he can easily peel for his carries as well."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Avoid regrouping closely because this will give Malphite a great opportunity to land a 5 person who strikes with his Ultimate h. Don't look for fighting in the jungle or around the Dragon or Baron. That's because the teams will usually be grouped closely together- which allows him to get a good Ultimate h off. Instead, try to fight in the open air in a way. Poke and disengagement are the biggest threats. If you can, try to bring him down as much as possible before a team fight occurs to make it almost impossible for him to engage without dying."}
{"text": "As leesin, If Lee Sin is late in the game, it will fight in the later parts of the game. Lee Sin is vulnerable to hard engagement and CC. If the enemy has a lot of CC, you will need to play around their CC tools if you want to perform cool maneuvers with your Ultimate k. It fights in the way when it plays against champions with good counter-engagement, short cooldowns and range: especially if they know how to handle minion waves."}
{"text": "As lux, During the blasting phase, focus on the descent of the enemy to get a health benefit. When the enemy is low, commit to an all-in. Try your hardest to keep your ADC alive as long as possible in the track. Provide them shields whenever they need them. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn towards the middle lane and try to take this tower. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead."}
{"text": "As vi, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. Post 6, avoid fighting them at any cost because they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will kill you easily. A good player will play around their Ultimate as often as he comes. You have to counter their waste pressure by doing the same thing."}
{"text": "As ornn, Play safe for the first few levels. You need time to come online and you shouldn\u2019t be fighting unless you have a clear early advantage.\n\nOnce you have a few levels under your belt, you can start to play aggressive and look for aggressive plays. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map throughout the early game. This is the best place for the wave to be as it offers you tons of extra protection."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Always keep an eye on what Ultimate Sylas has. If her Ultimate R is a very strong Ultimate combat team, try to wait for it to cool down before forcing a fight. Look at the flanks as Sylas will often try to flank a combat team with her E to get started. Make sure no one in your team is standing too much before or out of position as it can allow Sylas to choose them with her E and start the team fight."}
{"text": "Against galio, Avoid grouping closely together in team fights as it may enable Galio to get a 5 man knock-up with his R once one of his allies has engaged. Space out between one another for maximum survivability from the get-go.\n \nIf Galio uses his Ultimate R when you\u2019re near him, you can disrupt it with any crowd control abilities. This will be very helpful as it can stop him from using his Ultimate R to help his allies.\n \nIn team fights, try to harass and poke him down as much as possible before he can look to engage. By poking him down first, you\u2019ll make it impossible for him to look for an engage with his E and W. "}
{"text": "As seraphine, Use your Q and E to target both enemies and minions simultaneously to use your mana effectively. Don't spam those abilities either, as you will run out of mana quickly.\n\nOnce you get your first item component, you should be able to spam abilities way more frequently. Now you can look for aggressive trades with your Q and E.\n\nGetting your Ultimate R will be a huge turning point in the game. You can use it in a solo fashion, but the best use will be during clumped fights.        "}
{"text": "Against nocturne, Nocturne will look at the power farm early so he can get level 6. Try to invade him and take his camps to delay his level 6 power peak.

If you can't counter gank, try to ruin a separate lane or steal his camps."}
{"text": "Against lulu, Lulu\u2019s early game can be incredibly difficult to play against if you\u2019re a melee champion. Opt for sustain and defensive stats in the early game.\n\nOnce Lulu has completed her first item, her protection and shielding ability will increase dramatically. At this stage, she will also do a hefty amount of damage when trading.\n\nTeam fights are where Lulu shines thanks to her E and Ultimate R which can be used on her allies. She will be building items that protect herself and her allies too, so she will be a huge threat."}

The enemy does not have some kind of sifting potential and can easily be exposed to the ganks."}
{"text": "As yone, Yone will get two points in his Ultimate R at level 11, which will be a massive peak of power for him. It is mainly because he can easily remove enemies during this game phase, especially from the fog of the war. At level 9, Yone will have his first maximum ability. This means that his trades will improve considerably, and he will quickly snowball the game if he manages to get a few dead early. Yone is really good during the team fights because he can choose several targets with his Ultimate R. This will make it very important for the enemy to keep an eye on him, otherwise he can easily Ultimate R several people from the fog of the war."}
{"text": "As renekton, After entering with your Ultimate t, be ready to fold and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make access to the enemy backline easier, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid separating or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you are gone. Play around your Ultimate t in the later parts of the game.

If you go for the AD build, just focus on cleaving through the enemy team with your Ultimate c.\n\nGetting a defensive item should help you a lot as it will keep you alive for a longer period, especially if you are going for a secondary ADC build.

Skarner will build tank items and you will be unable to kill him if you do not buy these items."}
{"text": "Against kayle, Try to end the game as quickly as you can as the longer the game goes, the stronger Kayle becomes.\n\nKayle will tend to be split pushing during the mid-game.

{"text": "As vladimir, If your allies move to your lane after destroying their tower, rotate and move around the map to continue farming and gaining XP and gold.\n\nUse your abilities to clear the minion waves quickly so your team can siege/ prevent a siege from the enemy team.

It will allow him to impact the fights quite easily from now on."}

Beware of his level 6 all-in. If he can't physically everything within you, he can look to wander and use his Ultimate m in the middle lane instead. It's pretty early, so expect him to go for aggressive coins. Look at his positioning and play on the other side of him to make it all more difficult for him to everything in you."}

If the enemy Jungler keeps invading him, he won\u2019t be able to do much without his team\u2019s help.\n\nHis playstyle revolves around power farming till he gets his Ultimate e. This means he won\u2019t be able to gank or counter gank early on unless it is a guaranteed kill for him.\n\nHis Ultimate e deals meagre amounts of damage during the early game which forces him to use it only when the enemy is too low. This can be a detriment if he doesn\u2019t have his items or if he is set back early on."}
{"text": "As kayn, Depending on your form, you should either be the front line for your team using the red form, or you should be in and out of the enemy rear line and kill them. Your Ultimate R will be on a very short cooling now. This means that you can regularly all-in the enemy team and get free murders. Just make sure you don't target someone who has a leading ability up. Getting a defensive element should help you immensely, especially if the enemy team is mobile in nature. It will help you a lot during neutral and objective battles when you need to target a specific champion around the bottlenecks."}

Zyra has great potential for bursting and can easily blow up any squishy target as the game unfolds."}

Do not play super aggressive in team fights. Just kite and automatic attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will concentrate and down you. Continue kiteing in team fights and systematically adapt your positioning."}
{"text": "As garen, Its passive allows it to stay on the track even after taking a lot of damage from poke / all-damage from the enemy team. This can also lure the enemy team into wasting a lot of valuable call spells. Its E allows it to do more damage in 1 v 1s (as the damage is increased if the enemy is alone). This allows it to do a lot of damage with a complete rotation of its capabilities, and unlike Garen, the enemy has probably failed to regenerate much health and stay in the way. It is really good by flanking the enemy team with its Qs and E. Moreover, its tenacity W will allow it to get out of the enemy team if it decides to dive and disturb them."}
{"text": "As kled, Taking someone quickly will give you a huge advantage. As the enemy gets in position and prepares to group, someone can be isolated or alone (or they can be too far ahead).

Regrouping is important because you won't be able to impact the team fights if you're far from them- even with your ultimate R because it takes some time to get in position."}
{"text": "Against orianna, Orianna is good in team fights as her Ultimate d has a large radius and can CC multiple targets at once. Avoid standing close to your ADC post 6 so she cannot Ult d both of you.\n\nOrianna is weak early, but her poke can be very hard to deal with once she has a few levels behind her. This is especially true after level 4.\n\nOnce Orianna has completed her Mythic item, her damage output will be extremely high. Look out for surprise Ultimates d and try and stay away from her d."}
{"text": "As nasus, Nasus will have a decent amount of batteries and will take part in the team fights now. He should be a threat to all the squishy targets in the enemy team. He will now have several items, which will make it easier for him to go down from the wing and the enemy team. He will increase massively his damage performance as well. At level 11, he will have two points in his ultimate R. This will increase both his tankness and kill the pressure at the same time. His Passive will help him a lot when it comes to diving into the enemy rear line and surviving."}
{"text": "As darius, Darius starts to fall in the end of the game, but it is still powerful. He falls as other champions start to get elements that counter him, and many champions will be more tankier, which makes it harder for him to kill them. At level 16, Dariuss Ultimate e will be an essential tool in team fighting. As he can do a considerable amount of damage and as he is an execution- he will be able to remove targets and use reset to kill several targets. At this stage of the game, Darius should be almost max build. As he builds items that increase his damage and offer protection, he will be relatively tanky and difficult to remove."}

It can be hard for him to engage and be useful when he gets interrupted easily.\n\nSkarner isn\u2019t great if he is behind, as he will not be tanky enough to soak up damage, and he wont deal a lot of damage either.\n\nIf enemy teams split up completely, it can be hard for him to be super effective. The enemy frontline might block his Ultimate, and Skarner should avoid using his Ultimate on the enemy frontline. \n"}

{"text": "As shaco, It is not only a physical threat, but the mental war it instills on the enemy squishies allows Shaco to make multiple pieces that other Champions cannot make. It can leave the way and wander easily enough to get a cheese gank (even if it is laning). Its x can allow it to disengage as well as surprise all-in champions easily. It also acts as a counter to wear which have dashes and rely on kitting to win fights. Its e allows it to get out of sticky situations with ease."}

Try to fight him when he's focused on stacking as he can focus on the farm rather than fighting you--which will allow you to gain a health advantage. Don't push Nasus under his turret because it allows him to grow safely. Instead of freezing the way to your side of the map, he has to extend for the farm. Once Nasus has a few levels behind him and has several points in his W, he'll have good gank set up. You'll need to play safer if the wave is closer to his side of the map during this period so that you don't die of ganks."}

It is effortless for Vayne to bamboozle the enemy top laner now due to her invisibility.

It will give him a massive advantage when dealing with enemy laners who are pushed up and run down by him.\n\nNasus is very weak early on and can be bullied hard due to the lack of HP and stacks on his Q. His main goal will be to farm and stack up to decimate the opposition during the later parts of the game.\n\nNasus' first item will give him a damage and survivability boost in the lane.

At level 6, Jinx, Ultimate R can be an excellent trading tool and it can turn the tide of the track. If it doesn't use it in its own way, it could try to secure the killers with it in other ways with it. If you see its use of Ultimate R and it, up, ping your team.

When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle of the game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. After getting a murder, make the call for Baron or Dragon if your team is nearby and able to help you."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, This is the period of the game where you will want to work with your Jungler to get spikes on the enemy champions. This will allow you to avoid a lot of skirmishes and will put the enemy team back massively. Roaming and helping your other drags secure peaks is crucial to winning the game. Make sure you are all that if you have your allies nearby. Otherwise you will just die. During neutral combats, goals, you must zone the enemy out of the objective pit. If they get closer to you, use your Ultimate m to stop the enemies in their track."}

{"text": "Against camille, Camille can start crashing as soon as she reaches level 2. Make sure you are aware of the level 2 gank and don't push too far forward in the early lane. At level 6 Camille will have access to her Ultimate R which can be deadly if you are low and overheared. Respect her all-in and don't push without vision like her Ultimate R. After Camille has finished her juggling, she will be incredibly strong during escarment. Avoid fighting her alone unless you have a clear advantage."}

She will need to position well, though.\n\nHer W will be maxed out at level 9. This is a massive power spike and will allow her to heal her allies for large magnitudes. The damage will be pretty potent as well.\n\nTwo points in her Ultimate R will allow Nami to use the ability frequently and let her impact team fights quite often. She will just need to make sure that she has enough mana for it.         "}

It will help him take over the game later on.\n\nThe first item will be a significant power spike as well.

She will now annoy the enemy by completely negating assassination and burst down attempts from the enemy's end. She can use the ability to slow enemies down, especially the ones trying to escape from her.\n\nThe first item component will surely help Lulu out a lot in the lane.

This is a significant boost to his dueling power, and it will let him dominate 1 v 1's with utmost ease.\n\nDuring this phase of the game, Xin will be really tanky while simultaneously dealing a ton of damage to his enemies. This means that he will be tough to take down, and immobile or CC'd enemy carries will mostly die if they can't get Xin away from them."}
{"text": "As tristana, Play safe for the first levels. You need time to come online and you should not be in combat unless you have a clear advantage early. After destroying the lower lane tower, turn to the middle track and try to take this turn. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead. Once you have some levels under your belt, you can start playing aggressive and looking for aggressive parts. You benefit from extended trades, so try to go for them frequently."}
{"text": "As malphite, Low during the early game, especially against constant poke damage that can prevent him from regenerating his passive shield. Before six, he is quite susceptible to poke so that he will be forced to play defensively. He probably did not get any ganks either because he does not have his Ultimate h. The appropriate vision control of the enemy team will prevent Malphite from catching the out-of-guard enemy team. This will reduce his effectiveness and force him to find other ways to engage on the enemy team."}

As you\u2019re not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste an ability before playing aggressive.\n\nKeep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game.

{"text": "Against xinzhao, When Xin Zhao reaches level 6, his total pressure increases. He can look for an aggressive game as soon as he gets the level. When Xin has brought his first component element, he will be really strong in 1v1 skirmishes. Keep this in mind when you try to fight it. Xin is very good in the middle of the game. Expect that he frequently searches for coins around the map, or try to kill you again and again."}
{"text": "As orianna, The first element will allow him to inflict more damage and spam his abilities due to the increase of the mana.

{"text": "As graves, Graves deals a lot of damage to any target during this phase due to his Passive and items. It is a significant power spike for him, which can very well allow him to single-handedly carry a game.\n\nOnce he gets three points in his Ultimate t, no low health enemy on the map will be safe. He can just dash in, auto an enemy twice, and then use his Ultimate t to finish them off. Using the fog of war to do so is a great way to pick targets.\n\nAt level 13, Graves will be able to deal a lot of burst damage and play circles around the enemy due to his maxed out l and e. In addition, it will give him an excellent dueling advantage."}
{"text": "As yasuo, After your bot track has turned towards the middle lane, go to the side lane and start cultivating and winning XP there. You can look at 1v1 any enemy who tries to stop you. Look for frequent trades with the enemy throughout the laning phase. Getting an early killing could snowball the way strongly in your favor. Once you are level 6, look for more aggressive play. Your ultimate R is an excellent escarment tool and you can get early murders with it."}
{"text": "Against vex, Avoid entering the range of melee when Vex-W is at the top because it not only protects it but also inflicts damage to enemies close to it. Standing outside the wave of minions at any time will help you counter Vex and prevent it from using its Q to push the wave of minions and you poke at the same time. When you remember, keep an eye on your position as Vex-S Ultimate R could be used to sting and kill you. Try and remember behind the minions or out of sight."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Harass the enemy throughout the laning phase with your W and Q. Your goal is to constantly harass the enemy whenever possible and get murders. After destroying the tower of the lower lane, turn to the middle track and try to take this tower. This will open the map and give your team a gold lead. Poke and harass the enemy Mid laner and force them away from the goal to make it easier to secure the tower of the medium track. Every time your ultimate R is up, try to use it on the enemy lakers to get their weak health. Ideally, harass them first before using it to make it easier for you to kill the enemy."}
{"text": "Against fiddlesticks, Invest in early sustain and an early Executioner\u2019s Calling. He will try to out sustain you, so you need as many resources to equal or counter his sustain in lane.\n \nLook for fights when Fiddlesticks has an ability down. Preferably, his Q or W so he is unable to escape/ trade back with you.\n \nTry and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. Fiddlesticks is quite vulnerable to ganks and by keeping the wave near your side of the map, he will have to overextend for farm."}
{"text": "As sona, She can't do much if she gets camped in the track. Has no form of priority in the track at the beginning of the game as her Q makes scanty amount of damage and her W is better not used until it is absolutely necessary.

{"text": "As warwick, Focus on agriculture and hit level 6 as fast as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your waste potential.

{"text": "Against sylas, Sylas does not have the strongest of the whites in early play. You could use it to your advantage by invading it and trying to put it behind. Once Sylas hits level 6, he can fly some Ultimate bodies with his Ultimate R. According to the Ultimate he flies, his strength at that time will be different. The stronger Sylas will become. Avoid feeding him in the early game to reduce his strength in the middle and the end of the game."}
{"text": "Against varus, Varus is good at level 6 thanks to his Ultimate R.

Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is a great way of winning a team fight and ending the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies positioning.

You should be fighting more frequently, though, as you will be hurting a lot once your core items are completed.\n\nDuring fights, always stick with your team as you want to be protected while damaging enemies. Avoid getting pinned near a wall while doing so, though.\n\nWhen fighting for neutral objectives, it is important to stay back and wait for the enemy team to pass through the choke points before going for a full all-in on them. Let your front liners engage before doing anything."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Before invading, make sure that you have your passive stacked so that you can win the trade.

Post 6, they win the 1v1 as they are stronger when their Ultimate is in place."}
{"text": "As tristana, Do not play very aggressively in team fights. Just do kites and automatically attack the nearest enemy champion. If you walk too far forward, the enemy will concentrate and take you down. Continue to do kites in team fights and systematically adapt your position.

Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when no team fight occurs, but also spend as little time away from your team."}
{"text": "Against braum, Once Braum reaches level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate r, its threat of death increases considerably. Keep this in mind and be careful trying to harass him. When Braums E is at the top, trading with him will be much more difficult. Try and commit to trading while he is downstairs. If he uses it in a trade, wait for him to finish before continuing to fight. Braum is very good in team fights thanks to his coat and utility. Try and avoid the 5v5 right and instead of looking for catches or fights where you exceed the enemy's number."}
{"text": "As ahri, Stand outside of the minion wave so she cannot push and poke you at the same time with her Q.\n\nTake care for Ahri\u2019s E. While you need to stand outside of the main wave, make sure you\u2019re near the minion wave so it blocks her E.\n\nAt level 6, she is much stronger than you and her all-in increases. Play back and out of range to make it harder for her to trade with you.\n\nFocus on matching her pushing power when you\u2019ve got your first item. This will prevent her from getting free kills and turret plates."}
{"text": "As lux, During this phase of the game, you should simply focus on targets to a shot with your entire combo. Your Ultimate n will be on a pretty short cooldown so you can do a quick work of enemies. Getting a defensive element will help you a lot in this game against all-in-one comps. You will want to make sure that you position yourself well and look out for the assassins who are trying to kill you. Use your e correctly during this phase of the game and shield as many people as you can. This shield alone can save your entire team from death if you time properly, especially before they are hit by a high bursting ability."}

Keep your abilities just to trade back with him when he jumps on you.\n\nPlay towards the bottom side of the lane. This will make it harder for him to jump on you from the bushes and it will make laning against him easier. Additionally, prioritizing a ward in the closest bush will make laning safer too.\n\nThe enemy is strong in the early game, so expect him to play aggressively. "}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Avoid grouping too closely if the enemy has multiple knock-ups as it will allow Yasuo to get a really good Ultimate R off. Grouping but not standing on top of each other will reduce the effectiveness of his Ultimate R.\n\nDo not fight inside the jungle as it will make it easier for Yasuo to land his Tornado r knock up and follow it up with his Ultimate R. Fighting in the open will make team fighting more effective for your team. \n\nCC is your best friend in team fights. Locking him down with CC will make it very difficult for him to stack his r, dash with E and inevitably use his Ultimate R. Try to CC him as quickly as possible and take him down."}
{"text": "As zilean, Zilen's Ultimate t will be a rescuer and will allow him to save key targets during important battles. He will simply have to make sure that he uses it properly (the most fueled target). Zilen will now have several elements, which will allow him to do a lot of damage and use his Ultimate t frequently. The shorter cooldowns will undoubtedly make life abhorrent for the enemy team. At level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate t. This means that he will be more powerful and will have a lower cooldown at the same time. It will be a massive peak for him."}
{"text": "Against ziggs, Beware of roaming when Ziggs in the track as it has a good clear wave and can easily take your turn while you're gone. Kill it and then wander when it's out of the map. Ziggs-His main poke tool in the track is his Buncing Bomb Q. This skill has a short cooldown and makes a decent amount of AOE damage. Do not stay in the minion wave to avoid taking free damage. Zigg-Ses will constantly look for poke and push the minion wave so it can get an early turn with its W. Try to match its clear wave so it is unable to push you into Tower and take it easily."}
{"text": "Against zilean, Avoid grouping too closely as it will allow Zilean to land a good stun with his Q and potentially start the team fight.\n\nPlaying around Zilean\u2019s Ultimate t is crucial to winning fights.

{"text": "As taric, Taric's first major power peak is when he reaches level 6. He can look for aggressive pieces such as dives or risky skirmishes when he has his Ultimate R up. Taric can look for disgusting assault pieces if he invades, camps in bushes and tries to abuse the enemy Jungler. When he buys his first component element, Taric's aggression."}
{"text": "As twitch, His e, when combined with his s attack speed increase is a force to be reckoned with. He can get multiple early kills with this combo (and a decent Support if he is ADC). When in the Jungle, the Red Buff can amplify the effects of this combo.\n\nHis Ultimate c and his Passive allows him to shred through the enemy team with ease when they happen to be grouped together. This gives him a very strong advantage in choke points.\n\nHe can use his s to scout around and set vision for his team as well. Besides that, his k allows for some crowd control set-up for his team which they can follow up on."}
{"text": "As samira, Three points in his Ultimate R will give him a huge peak of power. The ability will dry up a lot of damage and heal Samira heavily, so that team fights will be optimal. His life flying combined with his damage and mobility during the end of the game will make him really good in team fights. She will just need to maintain a good positioning and use his W correctly. She will have several items during this phase of the game. It will allow him to flatten tons of damage."}
{"text": "As sett, Impressive duelling power, especially if he manages to catch an enemy out with his Flash E combo. This is quite potent in the bottom lane as he can use the lane brushes to cheese the enemy.\n\nHis Ultimate R allows him to both get tanks off his carries as well as deal a lot of damage to the enemy team if he manages to ult his target into them. This can change the tide of a team fight in an instant.\n\nHis Passive allows him to regenerate a lot of health so he can resort to short burst trades against enemy champions unlike other tanks. His W does deceptively high damage as well, while providing damage mitigation to him."}
{"text": "As kennen, A very good initiator for his team with the ton of CC he brings to the table. In addition, he also has a reliable form of poke with his 1, which he can use to overthrow enemies. His Passive is what makes him so dangerous. It allows him to easily CC and take several enemies with his Ultimate m and h. This allows his team to follow him easily. He is a rough track, and his poke allows him to easily beat melee matches. He can easily use this fact to his advantage and throw a snowball from his track."}
{"text": "As rumble, Another point in his Ultimate b will seriously tip team fights in chokepoints into his favor. All he needs to do is time it well and drop it at the proper places.\n\nHe will now have multiple items at his disposal.

He should be able to win multiple fights just by using his Ultimate b properly.        "}
{"text": "As tristana, The slow on her W can allow her to get kills quite easily. She will need to whittle her target down before that, or she can rely on a gank or her Support.\n\nHer E tower damage allows her to procure plates and destroy towers with ease. This will put her ahead in the lane, as well as get rapid objectives if she is left unchecked.\n\nHer self peeling ability is quite strong and she can get out of sticky situations with both her W and Ultimate R. This arguably makes her one of the safest carries in the game."}
{"text": "As gwen, When there is no team fight, go into a side track and try to divide the thrust. This way you will continue to win gold and XP that will help you get your next major power peak.

You will usually be bunched up together which will allow Wukong to get a great Ultimate n off.\n\nWard your flanks as Wukong will often try to flank from the side to get on to your team. Once you\u2019ve spotted him, poke him down or disengage if necessary."}
{"text": "Against volibear, Buy items that provide Grevious Wounds like Executioner\u2019s Calling or Morellonomicon. This will prevent him from healing and surviving team fights.\n\nIn team fights, avoid grouping too closely as it will allow Volibear to get a great Ultimate R off. Group, but do not stand too close together.\n\nVolibear has great pick potential in the mid-game. Avoid going in unwarded parts of the map if you know Volibear is in the vicinity. "}
{"text": "Against swain, Swain is super squishy and still. The good times to trade with him are when he walked forward trying to harass. When laning, make sure you have always stayed far behind but in front of your Caster Minions. This will make it impossible for him to land his roots E and CC you. At level 6, his pressure of death and survival increases. Unless you have the advantage, disengage as soon as he activates his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Master Yi will become strong and stronger with the most kills he gives. Avoid giving him kills in the early match. Once Master Yi reaches level 6, he will begin to ganten himself as his Ultimate r offers him tons of extra pressure Kill. Master Yi is very strong in the late match. Try to reduce his income to make it harder for him to snowball and take control of the game."}
{"text": "Against ashe, Once Ashe has her Ultimate w, do not overextend because she can easily install her Jungler with her. Keep the track monitored at all times as it is the only time it will be safe for you to overextend the 6 position. Ashe has no escape ability or integrated-in support. Use this to your advantage by getting her down frequently and then looking for the all-in when it is weak. To prevent Ashe from getting additional damage on you in the early game, stand behind the minion wave at any time so they block her Volley damage there for you."}
{"text": "As braum, A very important power spike when he hits level two. This is because he can easily all-in unsuspecting enemies with his Q and W along with some help from his lane partner.\n\nAnother power spike is at level three as he gets access to all his abilities and can now both all-in and play defensively as the game requires him to play. His E damage mitigation is very powerful and provides immunity against projectiles that would otherwise go past him.\n\nMajor power spike on getting his Ultimate r as he can now disrupt entire team fights and can pick enemies with ease in the enemy Jungle. When combined with his Flash, he can also initiate fights with ease."}
{"text": "As karthus, Karthus has a great objective control due to the amplified damage inflicted by his 1 on unique targets. It will allow him to finish the goals quite quickly once he has obtained some articles. Level 6 is an important peak of power because it allows him to stack his run, as well as to finish the enemies who managed to escape with a burst of health. Once Karthus gets his first element, he spams his abilities frequently because of the increased mana. His damage will also increase and will allow him to get a global lead in the game."}
{"text": "As ekko, At level 16, Ekko\u2019s Ultimate R will deal a lot of damage and be on a really short cooldown. He can look for insanely aggressive plays whenever it is up.\n\nMultiple items offer him low cooldowns and a lot of burst damage. Don\u2019t be afraid to go for plays.\n\nTeams will group closely in the late game. This is good for Ekko because it can allow him to get a multi-person W off and CC the whole of the enemy team."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Always try Ultimate e Taliyah as it will make her kill easily. It can't do much once CC'd and Deleted at the same time. Remember that Taliyah will certainly get a defensive element to counter your damage and all-in. You'll have to lure her before looking for a full blow all over her, otherwise you'll definitely end up dying. Taliyah will concentrate to counter a lot of gank in this matchup. This means that when you go for an all-in, use your dash with extreme discretion. It's important to keep an eye on Taliyah's location in this matchup, otherwise she can easily interrupt or initiate a gank using her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "Against aphelios, Aphelios is very strong in the team fights thanks to his Ultimate R. Try to take him down before or at the beginning of the team fight to reduce the chances of enemies to win the fight. The extended trades work in favor of Aphelios according to his weapon configuration. Try to keep the jobs short-preferably around his r. Once Aphelios gets his first element, he will be very strong and maintain very well in the way."}
{"text": "Against viktor, Avoid fighting around objectives as Viktor has a lot of poke with his y. His Ultimate m also deals AOE damage which will help him in forcing you off the objective.\n\nViktor\u2019s job in team fights is to poke as much as he can before committing to the fight. Try to force a fight as quickly as you can rather than allowing him to poke you down with his y and m.\n\nIn team fights, flank from the side or create different angles of approach to get on to him. This will make it really difficult for him to survive the team fight. "}
{"text": "Against ivern, If Ivern has the opportunity to steal your level 1 buff, you will fall early. Prevent this by placing pupils in the river at 1:25. Once Ivern reaches level 6, it unlocks Daisy R. This increases his ability to gank and power on the map. Try to delay his peak of power by flying his camps and counter the glove if necessary. Ivern usually strikes his peaks of power between 11 min and 20 min when he strikes his peak of power of 2 items (Redemption and Ardent). Always consider his Redemption by trying to kill the enemy."}
{"text": "As zed, Can catch enemies unaware with his W E Q combo, especially when the enemy is busy last hitting a minion. This combo does a lot of damage and can force the enemy to play defensively.\n\nHis W allows him to escape from sticky situations and ganks with ease. It also allows him to set-up kills for himself once he has managed to poke his enemy down.\n\nHis Passive allows him to finish off low health enemies with ease. When combined with his W, he becomes a really strong roamer who can camp lanes with squishy targets."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Yuumi's first item will give her a significant boost of power as she can spam her E frequently in the lane. It will allow her ADC and her to go for more frequent trades.\n\nOnce she hits level 6, she will become impressively adept at disengaging.\n\nHer level 2 is a small power spike as she will have access to all her abilities at that moment. She can now utilize her Passive and her E to keep going for short poke trades and protecting her ADC after that."}
{"text": "As qiyana, Level 9 will have its first capability maximized. This will result in a massive increase in damage and will immediately make it a high priority target for the enemy. Its kit is superb during the team fights. It can immediately turn the tide of a battle with a well-positioned Ultimate R and help its allies to achieve crucial goals during this phase. Level 11 will be another peak for Qiyana, this time in increasing damage and reduced cooling."}
{"text": "Against olaf, Olaf is a dominant laner and can easily get kills at level 1 and 2 with his t spam. Avoid fighting him early on.\n\nOnce Olaf hits level 6, it will be difficult for you to kill him or lock him down with CC. Don\u2019t commit to using any hard CC abilities when you know his Ultimate k is up.\n\nAs soon as Olaf completes his first item, he is going to deal tons of damage. Make sure you play respectfully and only trade with him if his t is down (or he is unable to pick up an Axe t)."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, He is inefficient before he gets his Ultimate n so he can be invaded during this time. He can easily be taken down if the enemy roams with another teammate.\n\nHis y is the only form of self-peel for him. Once that is down, his enemies can easily catch up to him, as well as crowd control him and force him to recall.\n\nHeavily countered by proper vision placement, especially during the early game. This will prevent him from roaming/ganking and will keep the solo laner safe against him."}
{"text": "Against karthus, Karthus will seek to cultivate as much as possible so that he can get his Ultimate e as quickly as possible. You can delay his 6-pitch power level by invading his jungle and flying his camps. Once Karthus has his Ultimate e, he can impact the map at any given time. During the fighting, always consider that he can use his Ultimate e to turn the exchange around."}
{"text": "As hecarim, Hecarim is quite assertive early on and should focus on getting a massive lead to ensure that he can take over the game quickly. He will require access to all his abilities and core items to run his enemies down. Playing the early game properly is crucial for this purpose.\n\nOnce Hecarim hits level 3, he can start ganking the enemies blatantly. Pushed-up enemies should be his prime target as they will let him get free kills. He should also be able to clear camps rather quickly from now on a respond to ganks quickly.\n\nOnce Hecarim hits level 6, he can terrorize enemies with his flanking potential. It will allow Hecarim to completely isolate a target from their team and burst them down with the help of his team. His sustain will be pretty high as well (due to runes and life steal)."}
{"text": "Against sett, Sett\u2019s level 1 can be hard to handle. Expect him to play aggressively and use Flash to kill you\n\nOnce Sett is level 6, his ability to get kills in lane also increases. Watch your positioning and disengage if he runs towards you post 6 and stay away from your allied laner so he cannot slam you into them.\n\nSett is good at picking off champions in the mid-game. Make sure you\u2019re never too far forward as he may try to catch you out of position with his E."}
{"text": "As missfortune, Miss Fortune has tons of poke with her t. She can also use her t to burst down enemies in the lane.\n\nHer Ultimate e is great when paired with team compositions with lots of CC as she can deal tons of AOE damage to the enemy.\n\nShe will win auto-attack trades with the enemy in the bot lane. Even though she builds AP, she will still beat the enemy Support when trading autos."}
{"text": "Against lillia, Once Lillia hits level 6, her gank and kill pressure will increase thanks to her Ultimate R. Take note that she will be harder to kill at this time.\n\nLillia\u2019s early game is rather weak. If you\u2019re a strong early game champion, try to invade and set her behind.\n\nOnce Lillia completes her jungling item, her clearing speed, damage output and gank pressure will increase. You can delay this spike by invading her and stealing away her camps."}
{"text": "As swain, Excellent CC chain if he or someone else on his team manages to CC a target. This works especially well against immobile carries.\n\nCan regenerate a lot of health with his W and hence outsustain his enemies in the lane. His Ultimate R amplifies this effect and is really effective when fighting in closed spaces.\n\nHe can use his W to set-up ganks for his Jungler as well. This allows him to catch up to his target while also providing vision of the area. The latter part is very useful when it comes to objective control."}
{"text": "As sion, Both of you are lane brush abusers so keep the brushes warded at all costs in this matchup for maximal effectiveness.\n\nIf he goes to some other lane, just push the wave and get as many plates as you can in this matchup. This is specifically true if he uses his ult.\n\nDuring fights, watch for flanking opportunities on the enemy. Getting to his backline will be relatively easy once he has initiated an all-in.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "As neeko, Do not fight in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. It is crucial that you only commit or look for fights when it is available as you\u2019re going to miss out on extra damage and CC.\n\nYour Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the later stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do so, use it to catch out someone isolated and alone, too far forward or way out of position.\n\nPeel for your carries to keep them alive for longer. If your allies die quickly, there will be little chance that you will win the team fight."}
{"text": "As akshan, You can use your E more liberally to get murders from now on. Your Ultimate will be on a short cooling time, to make sure you use it quite frequently. It will certainly help you cut off enemies who have already taken damage. If you have allies who have CC integrated into their kit, try to stay close to them. You should always focus on target CC'd and kill them when you get a chance. Also, if the enemy has a murderer, try to shade them and see if you can get the murder on them if they assassinate your allies."}
{"text": "Against karthus, Once Karthus has its Ultimate e, it can impact the card regardless of its positioning. Every time you fight the enemy, always take into consideration that it can use its Ultimate e to finish you. The more the AP and the more magical penetration Karthus gets, the better and the more it will be. Try to close it or constantly invade it to reduce its gold revenues. The more the game goes, the stronger the Karthus will be. Make sure to put it behind in the early game to make it less useful as the game goes."}
{"text": "As leona, This level of champions 2 is incredibly strong. They can often gain a health advantage or Summon an advantage in the way by playing aggressive and looking for an early one. You have a very good roaming potential once you have Mobility Boots. This gives you tons of card pressure. Every time your Ultimate e is up, you have a lot of pressure to kill extra."}
{"text": "As sivir, Try and stick with your Support throughout the mid-game. You\u2019re quite vulnerable and easy to kill if you\u2019re on your own. By staying with your Support, your survivability will increase.\n\nContinue picking up farm in the side lanes when no team fights are occurring, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to dish out damage in fights.\n\nLook for picks with your Support/Jungler to get kills and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As trundle, Another point in his Ultimate n will bolster his overall power during duels. It will also let him have a massive presence during team fights.\n\nHe should have his core items by now. This means that he will be tanky and will deal a lot of damage to his enemies. This should be amplified with his Ultimate n.\n\nHis first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will give a significant boost to his skirmishing potential during this phase of the game.        "}
{"text": "As heimerdinger, If the enemy team focuses on destroying his Q turrets before all-in\u2019ing him, he will have to play defensively till he can bring his turrets back up.\n\nMissing his E will put him in a vulnerable spot, especially if he is laning on his own or when he is pushed up. This mistake can easily get him killed.\n\nHe is very effective when he is fighting in closed spaces like the Jungle. The enemy can reduce this by fighting in the lanes and then matching his push if he tries to split push. Even in this case, if the enemy destroys his Q turrets, Heimerdinger will be done for."}
{"text": "Against leona, Make sure to hit Level 2 at the same time or before Leona that its level 2 all-in is very strong. In the lower lane, it is the first minion wave followed by 3 melee minions. Leona is the much stronger roaming potential than most Supports. If she is unable to kill the enemy in the track, she will seek to wander. As soon as she leaves the track, make sure to ping your team and communicate that it is missing. With good wave management, you can make it very difficult for Leona to engage. By keeping the wave closer to your side of the map, you will make it impossible for her to engage with her without diving your Turret."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Kassadin is weak early on as he can't get too close to his opponents to burst them down. This is mainly because of a lack of mobility and items until he hits level 6. To compensate, he should play safely and rely on proper vision setup to not die often.\n\nAt level 6, Kassadin will unlock his Ultimate k. That is his first significant power spike as he can now dash to or away from an enemy depending on the given situation. As the game progresses, this ability will play a pivotal role in Kassadin's success.\n\nOnce Kassadin gets his first item, he should deal a lot of burst damage to his enemies. Bonus points if he can shove his wave in and look for kills on other lanes. It will give him a considerable boost.        "}
{"text": "Against nautilus, Nautilus can play aggressive early as he has a lot of CC. Keep this in mind in the very early game.\n\nIn the lane, always make sure there\u2019s a minion between you and him at all times to make it really difficult for him to land his g.\n\nKeep in mind that Nautilus has the most CC in the game. Try and commit to trades when either his g or e is down to make it easier for you to kill him."}
{"text": "Against aatrox, If Aatrox ganks your way, try to keep the minion wave between you and him as long as possible. This will make it harder for him to land his W. If you have a dash, wait for him to throw his W before throwing away your dash tool to escape the reach. Aatrox=Q and E have long cooldowns. When he invades early, try to hide in the bushes and wait for him to use these abilities on the camp before trying to fight him. Aatrox will look to gank a lot at the beginning of the game. Keep this in mind and wait for him to be everywhere on the map."}
{"text": "As rumble, Rumble\u2019s effectiveness is drastically decreased when his Passive is not half filled. The enemy can try to trade with him freely during this point.\n\nHe is quite squishy and vulnerable when his r is on cooldown. This also applies when his weapons are overheated, which provides an opening for the enemy to all-in him.\n\nDue to his immobility, a freeze can ruin his laning phase entirely. This will make him prone to ganks and will not allow him to CS at all. "}
{"text": "As skarner, Focus on farming and hitting level 6 as quickly as you can. You need to hit level 6 as fast as possible to increase your ganking potential.\n\nYour Ultimate e} is an incredibly strong tool. Whenever it is up, try to use it to help your allies and get kills.\n\nTry to secure objectives with your team. If you can, try to keep it warded at all times if you\u2019re not in a position to take it yourself."}
{"text": "As fiora, At level 11, Fioras Ultimate R will be much better. Putting a second point in its Ultimate R is vital and its 1v1 killing pressure increases. Fiora is good in the middle of the game and will be looking for split thrust. She should be able to attract a lot of attention for her team so they can do things elsewhere like the Dragon or Baron. At level 9, Fiora will maximize her Q. This is a very important peak of power for her because it will allow her to look for more aggressive pieces, help her farm and also help her escape from sticky situations thanks to the cooldown bass."}
{"text": "As leesin, Lee Sin should finish the game by this point, as he will now start falling off. He will still be able to pick enemies off, though.\n\nOnce Lee Sin gets 3 points in his Ultimate k, he will disrupt enemy fights frequently and act as an asset to his team.\n\nLee Sin will have multiple items during this phase of the game. It will allow him to survive longer during his fights and let him play the role of the disruptor very effectively."}
{"text": "Against sion, One of Sion\u2019s power spikes is at level 6 when he unlocks his Ultimate R. It offers him extra kill pressure and survivability. \n\nSion\u2019s item power spikes depend on which build he\u2019s going. He has two distinct build paths (damage and tank) and each spike at different times.\n\nLess lane dominant champions should give him some space at level 3 as Sion can do a surprising amount of damage in the right matchup."}
{"text": "Against malphite, Malphite is at its weakest in the early game. Try to put it behind to delay its next power peak. Once Malphite is level 6 and has its **Ultimate**, its threat of death in the way increases and it can start to be more aggressive. Team fights are where Malphite really shines like his **Ultimate** is an AOE ability and can hit several people."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, Jarvan IV is one of the strongest early game junglers. Use this to your advantage to get an early lead by gaunting your allies as often as possible. Although gaunting is the key, you need to find a healthy balance between farming and gauntling too. If you fall late in gold and XP, you will find it hard to do well in the middle or end of the game. Focus on getting goals as often as you can. If you are unable to get them alone, ask for help from your allies so you can get them together."}
{"text": "As fizz, Just make sure you keep your distance. Try kiteing as much as possible. If it arrives within range, W away to create the distance and then continue to attack it automatically. Do not W directly to it. You need to reserve your W to escape his engagement. Usually, you will look for an all-in at level 2. You can't do this vs. fizz because it has a good potential to flip."}
{"text": "As lissandra, After your bot path has moved to the middle track, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere else on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. When no team fight occurs, go to a side track and push. It is important that you continue to grow during the middle game so that you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not stay right in the middle if you can't get anything done. As you are good for getting peaks and killing isolated targets, try to lure and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, call for a nearby goal."}
{"text": "As veigar, Veigar is relatively weak at the beginning of the game, and he should focus on trying to e and stack his passive when possible. His n will be useful to try to prevent all-in. After six, he will have access to all his basic abilities. It's huge for him as he can now CC enemies and then combo them with his r & e when possible. Level six is a significant peak of power as it gives him access to his finishing ability. Now he will just have to focus on throwing the enemy into the track before decimating them with his Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As leesin, If Lee Sin is late in the start of the game, it will fight in the later parts of the game. Lee Sin is vulnerable to hard engagement and CC. If the enemy has a lot of CC, you will have to play around their CC tools if you want to perform cool maneuvers with your Ultimate k. When you are gaunting your allies, if you miss your e, you have nothing to offer and you will have to retreat. Make sure you approach the enemy before using your e, or use your e before your e to approach the enemy."}
{"text": "As veigar, It will have a lot of passive piles during this phase of the game. This scale is infinite, which means that Veigar can about a full-health squishy target shot. His n will be on a very short cooldown during this point in the game. He will be able to secure a lot of choices, especially around choking points. Once his ultimate R is maximized, he will execute the enemies with ease. Any enemy who gets hit by his e will be in Veigar's Ultimate R tuture range."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Powerfarm in the mid-game. You need to earn as much gold and XP as possible so you can level up quickly.\n\nAvoid fighting too much in the mid-game.

{"text": "As sejuani, She is exceptionally tanky during this phase of the game. Her items will make her take significantly less damage, and she can even instigate tower dives to finish off enemies.\n\nThe fully maxed out Ultimate R is a massive spike as it allows Sejuani to use the ability frequently. The damage of the ability increases quite decently as well.\n\nHer team fighting is pretty decent during this phase of the game. She can CC her enemies for a long time, and the damage dealt by her is pretty potent."}
{"text": "Against lucian, * As Lucian is a varied AD champion, when playing as a melee champion, be prepared to sacrifice some CS for XP and health.

{"text": "Against trundle, Look out for Trundle\u2019s early game pressure. He can easily kill you at level 2 with his Pillar e. Don\u2019t walk too far forward.\n\nInvesting in healing reduction will make dealing with Trundle\u2019s sustain a lot easier in this matchup.\n\nStand in the middle of the lane rather at the sides of the lane.

{"text": "Against annie, Items such as Banshee, Guardian, QSS or ZhonyaS Hurglass are excellent against Annie because they protect you from her damage. If she advances, make sure to invest in one of them. In team fights, don't gather too closely because Tibbers R is an AOE capability that can stun several members of your team if you are grouped together. Stay close, but not very close that she can CC all your team. Lack of mobility and defensive statistics make her difficult to fight. Try to delay team fights as long as you can while you push her down. If she is weak, engage or use her Q or Tibbers R aggressively will be very dangerous for her."}
{"text": "As udyr, Concentrate them with your other front-line champions. As you are the Jungler, you must make sure that you are still alive in the late match. If you will die before a major goal scares, the enemy will be able to take it. Make sure that you are still on the side of the map that the next major goal is safe. If the Baron is up, always stay on the upper side. If you go bot and show up, the enemy will take the goal for free."}
{"text": "Against nasus, Nasus is weak early on. You can use this to your advantage to invade him and steal away his camps. Stealing away his camps will deny him stacks.\n\nHis Dragon taking capability is really weak early. Try and take the objective before he can gank bot lane and take it for himself.\n\nCounter ganking Nasus is pretty easy, so try and do it. Once he\u2019s gone in with his W, he only really has his auto-attacks and Q to deal damage."}
{"text": "As rakan, Keep them guarded so that you can see the enemy moving around the map and see them start the goal. Stay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so that you are not caught out. Being caught will lead your team to play 4v5. Do not keep alone unless you know where the enemy is. Peel for your allies as much as possible. Keep them alive as long as possible in the team fights is a must to win the game."}

He can instantly kill any enemy laner and chase them down once he has his Ultimate R.\n\nAfter Xin has picked up his first component item, he can trade very aggressively with the enemy. Furthermore, the extra damage he gets from this item will help him last hit and farm easily.\n"}
{"text": "Against rengar, During the middle of the game, avoid separating as Rengar will try to assassinate a target that is alone. Make sure to stay with your team to reduce their chances of taking someone. In the team fights, Rengar will try to shoot down an immobile target or squishy.

He will want to use the lane brushes to catch the enemy off-guard when possible."}
{"text": "As nocturne, Your goal in the early game is to win the most gold and XP as quickly as you can. Focus on agriculture rather than sowing or fighting.

Now, he can actually 1 v 5 against the enemy team and get out on top. He can play a game of mind and see if he can catch the enemy carrying agriculture in the side track. The brushes in the jungle are great places to hide to achieve this goal. Since Jax can treat a lot of coherent DPS and is strongly the related article, he will be powerful once complete build. He should get a defensive element, however, as he needs to survive to actually deal with the damage."}
{"text": "As jhin, You will want to go for short burst trades in this matchup. Use your Q and W as much as you can and make sure that you chunk the enemy out.\n\nMake sure you use your wards and E traps to save yourself from ganks.

Without it, he will be unable to maximize his damage output.\n"}
{"text": "As illaoi, At level 16, Illaoi will be able to put three points in her Ultimate R. This will make her really strong, and she will quickly turn the tide of a fight with a well-timed Ultimate R.\n\nIllaoi is really good in fights as she will be dealing a lot of damage and can easily peel for her allies. She can even poke out enemies who get too close to her, making a full-on team fight unfair for the enemy team.\n\nIllaoi will have multiple items during this stage of this game, and she will be highly tanky. This will not only let her deal a lot of damage but will also be able to absorb a lot of damage in return. In addition, she can easily sustain herself due to her Ultimate R."}
{"text": "As samira, At level 6, it increases considerably. Keep your distance to limit its all-in-one potential. Similarly, try to keep the minion wave even or closer to your side of the map. This will reduce its all-in-one potential and keep you safe. Your goal is to keep them down. Try to avoid going for extended jobs because they will often win these."}
{"text": "As ashe, You are extremely strong during the laning phase due to your long-ranged poke and auto-attacks. This allows you to play safely, chip on your enemy's health bar, and then all-in them with your Q empowered auto-attacks.\n\nThe amount of utility you bring to a team comp is massive. Your auto-attack slows and your Ultimate w CC can easily help your team secure picks before important objective fights. It also helps you increase CC chains on enemies.\n\nOnce you get two to three items, you can start slowing and shredding multiple members of the enemy team in close-quarter fights. This gives you a greater time to kite out enemies during skirmishes and keeps you safe from their CC while your team piles on them."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, A maxed-out Ultimate R will generally have a shorter cooldown than a Quicksilver Sash. This means that no one is safe, and he can pick high-priority targets during team fights.\n\nHe will have multiple items during this phase of the game, allowing him to take a lot of damage and dealing a lot of damage simultaneously during a fight. It will be challenging for the enemy to take him down.\n\nEnemies will stack defensive items, so it will become tough for you to kill them. That being said, separating the enemy carry from the actual map for a few seconds will help your team win a fight quickly."}
{"text": "Against ezreal, Ensure that you\u2019re always stood behind a minion at all times to make it harder for him to land his Q and poke you down. \n \nThe best time to go for trades and land skill shots on Ezreal is when his E is on cooldown. If he ever uses it aggressively, try to abuse the cooldown and look for an aggressive play while he\u2019s defenceless. \n \nIf Ezreal uses his Ultimate R to snipe someone on the map, ping your team as it moves across Summoners Rift. This will allow them to dodge the incoming ability. While this ability is on cooldown, you could look to play aggressive and try to fight him."}
{"text": "Against evelynn, Install the vision on its jungle camps rather than in the inner lane bushes. Evelynn will seek to execute someone before a team fight or objective spawning. Do not move around the map alone whenever a major goal is about to spawn. Stay in the team if possible. Keep track of Evelynns Ultimate R. When it descends, it is much less mobile and cannot escape the skirmishes without using its Flash."}
{"text": "As zac, Once he enters with his E, he can't go out due to his E being on a very high cooldown initially. If his Passive is down, he can't play so aggressively because of the threat of his being killed. This is applicable for early fighting in the middle of the game only. Teams with lots of CC and disengagement tools are really good against Zac. He struggles to get targets, use his Ultimate R and make use of his Q when the enemy escaped/ or CC."}
{"text": "As lucian, Stick with your team in the later parts of the game. If you walk away from them and die, it will be 4v5 and the enemy may be able to force a fight or end the game.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion in team fights and watch your positioning. Hold on to your E for the right opportunity. Do not use it recklessly.\n\nStick towards the back of your team near the Support so they can peel and protect you."}
{"text": "As vex, Keep securing picks with your overall burst and Ultimate R in the game. This will help you single-handedly take over fights if you use your abilities and Passive correctly.\n\nTry to set up death brushes when possible. Your W will easily fear enemies when combined with your Passive, and then you can proceed to blow them up.\n\nStick with your team and take fights in or around chokepoints for maximal effectiveness. This will allow you to get multiple kills in a brief period and eventually win the game."}
{"text": "As swain, Try to stay with your support throughout the middle of the game. You are very vulnerable and easy to kill if you are alone. Staying with your support will increase your survival. Keep picking up the farm in the side lanes when there are no team fights, but spend as little time away from your team. You need gold and XP to buy items and if you fall behind, it will be unlikely that you will be able to eliminate the damage in the fights. Look for choices with your support/Jungler to get murders and increase your lead. If you kill a key target, you could make the call for Baron."}
{"text": "As lulu, You will now have your basic objects, and you will be able to intimidate your laner unabated. Keep on your W for situations where you have to interrupt your laner. Continue with your assault after that. Use the track brushes to your advantage in the way to catch the out-of-guard enemies. The best time for all in someone will be when one of their powerful spells (like a mobility spell) is down. Always be ready to help your Jungler if they decide to invade the enemy Jungle or take the Rift Herald. Your ultimate R can really save your Jungler if they are stuck in a bad situation."}
{"text": "As sett, A maxed-out Ultimate will be up frequently, and clumped team fights will become a breeze during this portion of the game.\n\nHis damage is massive during the late game, especially with his W.

He can regenerate his health quickly because his Passive and his W true damage will melt through enemy health bars."}
{"text": "As gragas, The lane brushes can let Gragas assert a lot of dominance during the early game. It can allow him to zone enemies out, and he can also use the fog of war to go to some other lane and help his teammates. His Q makes up for some decent poke as well.\n\nlevel 3 is a massive powerspike for Gragas as he can now look for full-blown all-ins on the enemy target. Positioning may cause some hindrance as his E can be interrupted by minions. Using the lane brushes or his Flash should quickly solve the problem.\n\nGragas' level 6 is a significant power spike because he can now displace key enemy targets during a gank or all-in. It can let him pick off the enemy backline should he decide to go for the entire AP build. He can also work with his Jungler and pick off enemies with this ability."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Taliyah will want to delay a team's fight as long as possible while pushing you with its Q. Try and force a fight as soon as you spot it. Avoid separating and playing alone. Taliyahs Ultimate R will allow it to take enemies who are alone or isolated without assistance. Do not push too far forward if you don't have anyone nearby. Taliyah has good potential with its C. If you don't know where Taliyah is in the middle of the game, don't walk around Summoners Rift alone and avoid areas with no vision that it might be looking for a surprise attack."}
{"text": "As janna, Janna will have one of her abilities maxed out when she reaches level nine. Then, depending on the ability, she will either deal tons of damage or provide her allies with a giant shield, both beneficial for her team.\n\nOnce she hits level 11, she will put two points in her d. This will boost her healing significantly, which will be extremely useful during team fights.\n\nJanna's movement speed, combined with her Passive, allows her to rally her team and pick enemies off in the Jungle. In addition, she can easily disrupt escaping champions with her e and d knockback."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Just look to choose enemies with your abilities when possible. It will help make team fighting really unfair for the enemy team. Use your ultimate R to choose enemies when possible. It would be a remarkable ability to use when you see an enemy on a side track. Try to shoot enemies before all-in'ing. You may need Blue Buff to make sure you have enough mana to keep the ability of spamming."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Master Yi is strong in the late game as he can a-shot enemy door. Reduce his early utility to make him weaker later. His first major power peak is at level 6 when he unlocks his Ultimate r. Master Yi will become stronger and stronger with gold."}
{"text": "As sona, She is a god during this phase of the game when it comes to team fights. She will need to be careful about getting picked off, though.\n\nA fully maxed out Ultimate R will allow Sona to impact team fights quite often.

{"text": "As olaf, The final point in his Ultimate k will grant him a massive spike, and he will be able to dish out tons of damage to the enemy. Since the ability will be up frequently, he will be able to pick off targets easily.\n\nHis tankiness will be phenomenal during this phase of the game. Combined with his overall damage, it will become tough to deal with him for the enemy team.\n\nOlaf will definitely fall off during the late game as enemies start building defensive items. The burst damage of the enemy team will allow them to take Olaf down quickly."}
{"text": "Against tristana, Extended trades are going to work heavily in Tristana\u2019s favour if she has placed her E on you.\n\nAt level 6, Tristana\u2019s kill pressure increases as her Ultimate R can deal a lot of damage to you in 1v1 trades. Her Ultimate R is also versatile and can be used as a self peel tool.\n\nWhen she hits level 9, she would\u2019ve maxed her first ability. Her 1v1 potential will be much higher from here on out."}
{"text": "As zeri, Good versus team compositions with lots of shields.\n\nHer E allows her to escape sticky situations and get away from ganks easily.\n\nZeri\u2019s versatile. She can either go AP or AD depending on her team\u2019s needs.\n"}
{"text": "As shen, His E is quite short-ranged which makes it hard for him to land this ability from clear vision. This can hamper his all-in potential.\n\nIf he uses his W and Q carelessly, then he and his team will be in a really disadvantageous position, and will get pelted down quite easily.\n\nHis Ultimate R has a very long cooldown and will force him to lose priority almost instantly.

{"text": "As tryndamere, In the late game, look for picks on immobile or miss positioned enemies. Taking someone down in the late game can give you enough time to force a fight, siege an objective or take the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nIf the enemy is grouping, look to group with your team too. In team fights, continue to focus the squishiest and easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline.\n\nFlank in team fights to make getting on the enemy backline easily. Make sure you\u2019re near your team at all times so you can get in the fight fast."}
{"text": "As sylas, Sylas is strong enough during the middle of the game, especially if he gets a solid ultimate from the enemy team. His life flight will prevent him from dying quickly during important battles. Two points in his Ultimate R will allow him to take enemies' ultimates quickly and increase their overall efficiency. He can be very beneficial in team fights. His first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will give him a huge boost and allow him to blow up simple targets with ease."}
{"text": "Against nautilus, Nautilus can play aggressive early because it has a lot of CC. Keep this in mind in the game very early. In the way, always make sure that there is a minion between you and him at any time to make it really difficult for him to land his g. Keep in mind that Nautilus has the most CC in the game. Try and commit yourself to trading when his g or e is down to make it easier for you to kill him."}
{"text": "As volibear, His laning phase is quite decent, with him being able to poke enemies with his E and taking regular short trades. Using the lane brushes will undoubtedly help him a lot.\n\nLevel six is a massive power spike. It will allow him to increase his overall dueling potential. It will enable him to tower dive side lanes when an opportunity arises.\n\nHis first item component will give a massive boost to his dueling potential and survivability. It will let him be more aggressive and duel more frequently.        "}
{"text": "Against gangplank, In team fights, try to destroy his Barrels E before he can blow them up. This will reduce his AOE damage and his ability to win fights.\n \nTry to avoid fighting in areas that are tight like around objectives or in the Dragon as his Ultimate R will hit your whole team. Fight in lanes rather than in the jungle and make sure you\u2019re not grouped closely together.\n \nWhenever Gangplank has his Ultimate R, ping your team so they know that he can impact skirmishes."}
{"text": "As sion, Your goal in the early game is to play safely, pick up gold and XP and avoid dying to the enemy lantern. You are rather weak in the early game and need time to come online. Once you have several levels under your belt, you should look for favorable short jobs. As you are not strong in the early game, you may wish to wait for the enemy to waste a ability before playing aggressive. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map in the early game. This will ensure safety and reduce your chances of dying in the way."}
{"text": "Against amumu, Amumu has a very weak early game and is susceptible to invades. If you\u2019re a strong 1v1 champion, try and invade him early to set him behind and delay his level 6 power spike.\n\nAmumu needs to hit level 6 as fast as possible so he can gank with his Ultimate y. Try to gank as much as you can early on so your allies are stronger than his. This will make it harder for him to gank when it comes time to do so.\n\nLike suggested, Amumu has a weak early game and will be looking to power farm. If he does show on the map, or if you\u2019re stronger than him, you could invade his jungle and steal away some of his camps. This will delay his level 6 power spike and delay his Ultimate y which in turn, will also delay some of his ganks."}
{"text": "As taric, You will need a hard leash early on others you will run around the card without any mana. It would be better if you go for the Blue Buff first in this game. Once you hit level 3, you should be good to go and can start to glove. Overheard enemies should be your main target and use your W and E to CC and kill enemies. Once you get your Ultimate R, you should be all good to focus on a track and a door. It's up to you if you want to carry to have your camps but don't fall too behind on CS."}
{"text": "As elise, Peel for your team in team fights. Keeping them alive and using your E to protect them and keep them alive is important. Focus the closest champion to your wearer to make them easier to kill as well. Look for choices with your E. CC.

Elise is at this point unless she advances in the late game."}
{"text": "As draven, Draven is one of the strongest ADC champions around. Use your early play pressure to play aggressively and get murders. Thanks to his passive and g, Draven can win more gold than many champions if he is able to cash in his batteries. Draven is an incredibly strong 1v1 champion and he can do damage and beat most of the ADC's enemies in 1v1. This makes him a great choice in most ADC matches."}
{"text": "As jarvaniv, If Jarvan builds AD, he will be very squishy in the team fights and will get blown up quickly in the team fights. Once he has entered, he will have to engage fully in the fight. To ensure the victory, you must make sure that your team is able to follow. If you enter without them, you will die. If he falls behind, Jarvan is not so good. He will be too squishy in the fights, do not inflict any damage and fight to protect his team, you must make sure that you go ahead in the game early and play around your Ultimate m."}
{"text": "As shen, His E is quite short-range that makes it difficult for him to land this clear vision capability. This can hinder his all-in-hand potential. If he uses his W and Q with negligence, then he and his team will be in a really disadvantageous position, and will let themselves down quite easily. His Ultimate R has a very long cooldown and will force him to lose priority almost instantly."}
{"text": "Against nilah, Her first power spike is at level 3. She could look for an aggressive play once she has access to all of her basic abilities.\n\nNilah\u2019s second power spike is when she hits level 6. She will usually hit level 6 before the enemy in lane, so keep this in mind when you\u2019re both level 5.\n\nAnother power spike for Nilah is when she gets her first component item. Nilah\u2019s trading power will be enhanced, and she will be stronger in skirmishes.\n"}
{"text": "As maokai, Getting 3 points in his Ultimate R will undoubtedly make Maokai spike really hard. He can use his Ultimate R quite frequently, making it hard for the enemy team to do anything.\n\nHis tankiness is out of the world during this part of the game. Combined with his Passive, he will be able to tank damage for days and peel for his carries.\n\nMaokai's team fight efficiency skyrockets during this phase of the game. This is due to the utility and picks potential embedded in his kit."}
{"text": "As neeko, Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to inflict massive damage with his Ultimate R. The cooldown will also be reduced. It will now have its basic elements, allowing him to deal with a lot of damage. This will help his team during the fighting, especially the fights of choking points. The first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will increase his overall damage in the game, and she can easily ambushed someone."}
{"text": "As nidalee, It is quite intense during the beginning of the game that its clearings are quite fast. It can burst enemies and duel quite effectively early. Unlike the other champions, the level six is not a massive peak because it does not provide it much. On the other hand, its early play power is due to the transformation Ultimate r. The first component element will allow it to duel enemies more easily. It will also allow it to use its abilities quite frequently."}
{"text": "Against veigar, Try and space Veigar accordingly in the team fights. Do not position too far forward that it will allow Veigar to catch you with his n and start a team fight. Locking Veigar down with CC will be the best way to deal with him in the team fights. He is pretty squishy so if you are able to mount him and shoot him at the beginning of the fight, your team will have a easier time to win. Veigar will use his Ultimate R to try to bring down a weak / defenseless enemy. Buying items that will make you less likely to a-shot with his Ultimate R. Standing as far away as possible will also reduce his chances of using it on you."}
{"text": "As kennen, Kennen will try to poke you out when you're farming so stay behind the minions and look for all-ins when possible.\n\nOnce he gets his Ultimate, you will have to be careful about your backline getting dove from the fog of war.\n\nIf he is using his Ultimate, jump on him immediately. You may get CC'd, but you will definitely save your backline.\n\nKeep the wave somewhere in the middle of the lane. It will give you enough opportunities to take the enemy down."}
{"text": "As masteryi, If they invade you, just back, as they can easily kill you, especially if you are behind. They can secure the lens so much easier than you can. Keep them guarded to spot them before they can secure the lens. Post 6, avoid fighting them at any cost because they are much stronger than you with their Ultimate and they will kill you easily. It will be ruined much sooner. Make sure to apply as much pressure as you can to match its first ganks."}
{"text": "Against syndra, After Syndra\u2019s first back, she will have a lot of pushing power. Make sure you match her damage on the minion wave so she is unable to get early plates and roam priority.\n\nSyndra\u2019s E has an incredibly long cooldown. If she uses it to trade with and misses, use this timer to play aggressive and poke her down.\n\nPost 6, if Syndra has lots of balls on the floor, do not commit to a trade as her Ultimate R will deal lots of extra damage. Commit to trades when she has no balls on the ground."}
{"text": "As sion, Its ultimate R can be used to install ganks on other tracks. No one suspects a Sion from the base and down or midway. Its E is a very easy skill to land that guarantees a Sion Q. This can be of great value for setting up ganks for its Jungler."}
{"text": "As lulu, Her late game is phenomenal as she can peel for her team for days. No one can come close to her team as long as her W and Ultimate R are up.\n\nLulu's Ultimate R at level 16 is a force to reckon with. It will be challenging for the enemy team to eliminate Lulu's team due to the short cooldown of the ability, and killing Lulu will really become next to impossible.\n\nLulu will be full build by this time in the game. Her shielding potential will be out of the world, and she can enable her entire team if she manages to use her abilities properly."}
{"text": "As monkeyking, The last point in his Ultimate n will allow him to inflict enormous damage to the enemies. He should try to look for flanks during the team fights to maximize his use Ultimate n. He will now have a lot of articles, which will really make him tanky and allow him to inflict a lot and a lot of damage in a short time. The enemy team will have trouble dealing with him. Wukong is quite substantial during this phase of the game. Yet, he will find it hard to kill them because of their purchase of defensive items. You will want to group with your team as often as you can."}
{"text": "As syndra, Stick with your team in the late game. Do not split up or walk away from them; otherwise, the enemy may try to pick you off or initiate a 4v5 fight when you're away from your team.\n\nLook for picks with your abilities. Picking someone off and then collapsing on them to take them down is an excellent way to win a team fight and end the game. Look for picks on isolated targets if possible.\n\nKeep a constant eye on you and your allies' positioning. You need to poke the enemy down and delay fights in the late game, but you need to watch your positioning as you move forward to harass. Do not get picked off while trying to harass and poke the enemy down."}
{"text": "As sett, Do not fight him for a long time as Sett will easily be able to retaliate back with True Damage. You will have to use your mobility but ensure that he is on the outer edge of your Q.\n\nDuring team fights, make sure you know where Sett is positioned. One small mis-step will get you CC'd to oblivion and killed.\n\nKeep chipping on his health bar as much as possible in this matchup. Once he is low, look to ult him and take him down.\n\nKeep the wave close to your tower. The enemy has no sort of sieging potential and can be easily exposed to ganks."}
{"text": "Against masteryi, Disengage is Master Yi\u2019s worse nightmare. As soon as he activates his Ultimate r and runs towards your team, disengage so he cannot take over the fight.\n\nWhen low, make sure you back away even if Master Yi isn\u2019t there. If he picks up free and easy kills, he will snowball heavy and take over the next team fight.\n\nTry and wait for Master Yi to use his e before locking him down with CC. As he can use his e to dodge skill shots and CC if timed correctly, it\u2019s best to wait for him to use this ability before trying to kill him."}
{"text": "As amumu, It is important that you avoid using your r and m too often. Make sure to switch your r effectively to avoid running out of mana. Team fighting can be difficult for Aumu as you are inclined to disengage, poke and CC. Be prepared to flanculate in team fighting to make it easier for you to catch the enemy out of position."}
{"text": "Against braum, Braum does not have the best to support in the early game. Try to harass him and bring him down every time he tries to last hitting minions. If you can keep him low, he will never be able to engage. In the team fights, avoid being too close together as this will allow him to hit several champions with his Ultimate r. Group but not stay super tight together. The more the game goes the Braum tankier gets and the stronger his ADC becomes. Try and place him behind in the early game to make it harder for him to peel for his ADC while the game is going on."}
{"text": "As viktor, His early play is terrible, and he should avoid fighting for longer periods of time during this game phase. Focus on scale and agriculture. Level six is a decent power peak because it allows Viktor to develop a decent amount of pressure to kill in the way. It will allow him to impact the fights quite easily as well."}
{"text": "As anivia, Try to ride around and neutral impact, objective fights with your e and Ultimate m. You should use your t to CC several targets during a trip and completely cut the escape of the enemy champions. Be the first to turn and switch to goals like the Dragon or Rift Herald and help your Jungler take them. Anivia can help take these incredibly fast goals while zoning the enemies with your Ultimate m. Make sure you have the vision around your way at all times. As you will constantly push, you must make sure that your flanks are monitored, so that you do not die while you are overstretched and pushing."}
{"text": "Against seraphine, At level 6, Seraphine will unlock her Ultimate R. This makes her more than one threat and she will be able to install her Jungler quite easily. Seraphine is good in the team fights thanks to her Ultimate R. Avoid regrouping closely so that she is unable to get a powerful Ultimate Roff. Once Seraphine has finished her first element, her Q damage will increase and her threat to kill."}
{"text": "As teemo, Level sixteen will further reduce the cooling of its Ultimate t and increase the damage of its mushrooms. Enemies will have a hard time crossing bottlenecks now. It will have a lot of Hast capacity now, which means that it can deposit a lot more mushrooms around the map. Enemies will have to invest massively in the vision to keep themselves safe. It will complete its construction during this phase of the game, which will allow it to shoot a squisy target. Its blind t should come in practice during this phase of the game as well."}
{"text": "As aatrox, If you can get an early lead, try to abuse it to get more dead in the way to increase your chances of winning the game. You are a very mobile champion thanks to your E. It can be used in many ways and is a good way to turn around the exchanges with the enemy. You have tons of support thanks to your Passive and Ultimate. This will increase your survival in team fights and skirmishes."}
{"text": "As nunu, Always stay out of vision and try to run your laner down with your W and E. It should let you chunk them down massively and probably kill them soon as well.\n\nOnce you unlock your Ultimate R, you should be able to all-in enemies with ease. Set up death brushes near-neutral objectives to maximize the effect.\n\nAlthough you are not the Jungler, your Q will still be extremely invaluable when it comes to winning.         "}
{"text": "As poppy, Very strong all-in-the-way potential with its E. This when combined with its slow Q, can allow it to lock an enemy for a while. Its W is the jerk of any champion with dashes, especially all carriers that depend on their dashes. Its Ultimate R can allow it to turn the tide of a fight almost immediately because it can turn a 5 v 5 into a 5 v 2 easily. It also acts as a great source of disengagement for it."}
{"text": "As gragas, Once Gragas manages to get to level 11, he will have two points in his Ultimate R. This means that he can initiate fights and displace key enemy targets way more frequently.\n\nAt level 9, Gragas will have his first ability maxed out. This is really beneficial for him as the damage increase will really help him duel. This is especially true if Gragas is going for the full AP build.\n\nDuring the mid-game, the enemy will be busy swapping lanes and setting vision. However, as a laner, he will use this ability to the fullest potential when fighting around clumped areas and neutral objectives."}
{"text": "Against akshan, Try and keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early. Doing so will make his all-in less effective.\n\nPost 6, try to interrupt or somehow force Akshan to top his Ultimate. This will increase your survivability and it will be put on a short cooldown.\n\nKeep in mind that early armor will be very beneficial in this matchup. Akshan is an AD champion, so picking up early armor will protect you from some of his damage.\n"}
{"text": "As kayn, At level 16, Kayn will have his Ultimate R maxid completely. This will directly strengthen his ability to all enemies and kill them because of his bursting damage. Kayn will now have several objects. It is good for him, depending on his form. He can assassinate people if he goes for the blue shape, while he can act as a front line if he goes for the red shape. Depending on the shape and build, Kayn will be either a murder machine due to his bursting damage or a tanky and non-killable front line that will easily detach for his wagons."}
{"text": "As shaco, During the laning phase, it is very easy to abuse and get high. It is best chosen in tank champions. If Shaco is behind, it will be very difficult for him to get back in the game. Shaco relies on the advance to be useful in the later parts of the game. Shaco can be difficult to master. You must avoid being super obvious with your coins, especially with your Ultimate l otherwise, you will not fool anyone."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Xin is vulnerable to the CC during the team fights, don't ignore it. Focus on him when he engages. As he is a powerful champion of skirmishes, he will look for choices on enemies who walk around Rift Summoners alone. Avoid walking in areas that are not rewarded unless you know where Xin Zhao is. When Xin Zhaos Ultimate R is on cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable. Force Team fights when his Ultimate R is down to increase your chances of winning the fight."}
{"text": "As corki, During the half-game, Corki will have finished several articles. He will have a lot of poke during the half-game too. This makes him quite good during this stage of the game. At level 9, Corki will maximize his b. His clear wave and the ability to push the enemy in their turn will be constantly high enough. If he is laning vs. a heavy roam champion, he will force them to stay in their way. At level 11, Corki can put a second point in his ultimate e. This will increase his clear wave and poke."}

{"text": "As mordekaiser, Don't fight in the late part unless your Ultimate R is in place. It's crucial that you don't engage or look for fights when it's available because you're going to lack a lot of potential to kill pressure. Your Ultimate R will be on a shorter cooldown in the final stages of the game. If you can find an opportunity to do it, use it to catch someone who is isolated and alone, too far ahead or out of position. Peel for your efforts to keep them alive for longer. If your allies are dying quickly, there's little chance that you'll win the team fight."}

{"text": "As ezreal, Darius can start crashing as soon as he reaches level 3. He needs all of his basic capabilities before starting to gank. His best early-playing power peak is when he reaches level 6. His ultimate e greatly increases his 1v1 power and escarment and he will be a huge threat at that time. After completing his first component element, Darius trading and killing pressure further increases. He can 1v1 most enemy Junglers at that time."}
{"text": "As janna, Janna will have one of her capabilities to the maximum when she reaches level 9. Then, depending on the ability, she will either inflict tons of damage or provide her allies with a giant shield, both beneficial to her team.

Use the effigies and bamboozle enemies with surprise Ultimate R's on them."}
{"text": "As lillia, Level 11 will be a decent power peak for Lillia because it will have an improved Ultimate R. The cooldown will be reduced, which will allow Lillia to play games frequently in the game. Its Q will be maximized to level 9. This is really good for her because its burst damage will increase exponentially, and it will be a threat to face. Lillia excels during the middle of the game due to her ability to secure choices."}
{"text": "Against brand, Avoid fighting in tight neighborhoods like inside the jungle or around a goal. This will make its Ultimate R much less powerful. With that said, when the group tries not to get too grouped together so that it can't bounce its Ultimate R between several champions either.

Brand will try to inflict a lot of damage and delay a team fight for as long as possible while brewing."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Its overall power increases with the number of drakes it captured at the beginning and middle of the game. Therefore, it must prioritize them. Level sixteen is a good peak of power as well. It will strengthen its Ultimate t damage in the game, and it can blow up enemies with ease now. Its overall strength will depend on the construction it goes for. It can either blow up enemies from afar with its AP construction, or it can dive into the enemy team and act as a bruised one."}

His E slows as well, which makes it really easy for him to deal with healers and engage Support champions.

{"text": "Against zilean, Zilean will often be left alone to erase the waves with his Q. Try to choose him before sitting a goal to make the catch much easier.

Try to force fights when his Ultimate t is down."}
{"text": "Against pyke, Once Pyke has secured Serrated Dirk, he will try to constantly push and wander. Keep this in mind when the laning against him. When Pyke reaches level 6, his death pressure increases as his Ultimate R is an execution. Step back when weak so he is unable to kill you and snowball his lead. Pyke is really good at roaming. Once he has Mobi Boots, expect him to wander around the map and help his allies. Ping every time he disappears."}
{"text": "As kogmaw, Very still that can make him a primary target to hire the champions. Once engaged, he can do nothing unless he gets help from his teammates.

{"text": "As draven, It has a unique mechanic that makes it incredibly difficult to control. Playing around its g is crucial for a good Draven, and it takes some time to get used to.

Make sure to keep the track guarded at all times to reduce the chances of what happens."}
{"text": "As shyvana, Shyvana is very weak pre-6, and you are much stronger than her.

Make sure you take those Dragons away from her when possible."}
{"text": "As teemo, It is vulnerable when its t is down, and can be engaged if its speed of movement k is reduced. Its ultimate t can easily be rid by the enemy by buying Control Wards.

Combined with his Wuju Style, he inflicts a lot of damage."}

It can cancel all-in-one almost immediately with his W and make sure that the high enemy's lantern is pushed out of the way. Level 6 is a massive peak of power. It will now annoy the enemy by completely denying the assassination and breaking out the attempts at the end of the enemy. It can use the ability to slow down enemies, especially those who are trying to escape from it. The first element will surely help Lulu to get out much in the way. It can spame its capabilities frequently and inflict additional damage to the enemy. The track brushes will help him immediately."}
{"text": "As corki, Corkis b has enough cooling time. This can make him very vulnerable while he is on the cooling. You have to play safer after using it, and avoid using it aggressively if the enemy Jungler is nearby. Presses heavily on the mana for poke and push. Even if his Ultimate e does not cost a lot of mana, he can run low on mana quickly if he is constantly using his b and Ultimate e together. When he is out of mana, he is not a threat and he can neither use his b to escape. Corki is a squishy champion. This makes it difficult for him to survive the phases of laning against the champions with a lot of damage and poke."}

{"text": "As nocturne, Fully maxed out Ultimate a will reduce the cooldown of that ability quite significantly.

Fizz is a murderer and can remove the squishy champions easily. He is incredibly strong in the middle of the game if he can get choices."}
{"text": "As yasuo, His W is almost useless against you, because only your d can be blocked by it, but he can also save his death by having him almost always out of the water down. Try not to stay close to your minion wave, because Yasuo can use it as a way to close the distance and make trades favorable for him. Let Yasuo push the wave to levels 1-5, because he can't really trade you under turn unless he has the help of the jungle, and use these windows to make it fall using your d and self-attacks."}

{"text": "Against rengar, Rengar will feed the farm so it can get its Ultimate R quickly. You can delay its peak power by flying its camps or invading it. It is really good after the laning phase has finished because it can get peaks with its Ultimate R. Avoid walking around Rift Invocators alone otherwise it can try to catch you out of position. Rengar is stronger every time it has 4 piles of Ferocity. Avoid fighting it if you come into contact with it when it is completely stacked."}

{"text": "As malphite, During neutral and objective battles, make sure to take the enemy jungler first before taking the goal.

It allows him to easily CC and pick off multiple enemies with his Ultimate m and h. This allows his team to follow up on him with ease.\n\nHe is a lane bully, and his poke allows him to easily beat melee matchups. He can easily use this fact to his advantage and initiate a snowball from his lane."}
{"text": "Against sivir, Stand away from the minion wave when possible. This will make it harder for her to poke and harass you with both her Q and W.\n\nDon't give Sivir free mana by randomly poking her with abilities. Only use your abilities to poke with if you\u2019re in a position to go in and kill her. \n\nPost level 6, avoid overextending when low as Sivir\u2019s Ultimate R can be used aggressively to catch you out while you\u2019re overextended.

Regardless of what transformation you want, you need to get it as quickly as you can. This can be achieved by fighting often.\n\nKayn has good objective control. Try to secure objectives as often as possible in the early game."}
{"text": "As fizz, Don't play too aggressive or lose a lot of health early. Wait to trade and be willing to sacrifice some CS for XP so you can look for an all-in later. Once you have a few levels under your belt, look for aggressive play and go to kill. Fizz has tons of burst damage, which will make it easier to kill the enemy. But once again, staying healthy is the key if you're looking for anything in someone. Once you have your ultimate R, look for an all-in. Fizz has tons of pressure to kill with its ultimate R and it will usually lead to a kill."}
{"text": "As taliyah, Your goal throughout the laning phase is to poke and harass the enemy in the way. You have a lot of poke, so try poke the enemy down as often as you can. Play safe for the first levels while you land poke on the enemy with your Q. Once they are low enough, you can commit to an all-in-one. Once you hit level 6 and bought key elements, look to constantly harass and push the enemy in their turn. This will allow you to win turret plateau and increase your gold income."}
{"text": "As fizz, When Fizz puts a second point in his Ultimate R at level 11, he will be incredibly scary to play against because his Ultimate R will be on a low cooldown and deal a lot of damage.\n\nFizz will max his first ability at level 9. His kill pressure and skirmishing power will be quite high post level 9.\n\nThanks to his low cooldowns and the overall game state, during the mid-game he will be able to assassinate and get picks on low health enemies as they walk around Summoners Rift alone."}
{"text": "As kassadin, Level 16 is the most essential peak of power for Kassaddin. This allows him to use his Ultimate k frequently, which can cause a lot of chaos in the enemy team. Kassaddin will do a lot of damage during this phase of the game. It will allow him to remove huge pieces from the enemy's health bars, which will allow him to win the game for his team. His presence in the team fights will be really high, especially if he manages to get a flank on the enemy team. His ability to penicate, shoot down enemies and get out of it is phenomenal."}
{"text": "Against akali, In team fights, Akali will look to dive the backline and take out the squishiest champions first. As soon as she engages, try to lock her down with CC/ peel her away from yourself and your allies. CC is your biggest friend when it comes to beating her.\n \nIf Akali engages and is hidden inside her W, back away from the Shroud until it\u2019s disappeared. This will make it much harder for her to fight and survive if she cannot hide within it.\n \nIn the later stages of the game, try and stay as a team and try not to wander the map alone. Akali has a ton of burst and can easily assassinate squishy targets that walk alone."}
{"text": "Against sett, Avoid grouping to closely as it may allow Sett to get a multi-person E off which will help his team win the team fight. Splitting up slightly will be better for you in the long run.\n\nDo not walk too far forward when sieging an objective as Sett may use his Ultimate R to pick up the closest champion and launch them into their allies behind them. If you\u2019re grouped together and in line with one another, it will be harder for him to do this. \n\nWhen no team fights are occurring, Sett will put himself in a side lane and try to split push. When he is alone, you could look to either pick him off or start a team fight with his allies when he is unable to help them."}
{"text": "As maokai, Try to place your saplings in the lane brushes and take control of them. This will help you a lot when trying to all-in enemies and picking them off in the enemy jungle.\n\nYou should start ganking at level 3. Your W and Q make up for some excellent lockdown and CC, while your E can dish out some damage to the target.\n\nGetting your Ultimate R will be a massive spike in the game. This is important for the rest of the game, and you can easily catch out enemies and initiate team fights.        "}
{"text": "As diana, At level 16 and with 3 points in her Ultimate R, the damage to AOE Diana and all the potential will be extremely high. As the teams will regroup in the last game, she will be able to inflict a lot of damage to several enemies at once. While Diana will inflict a lot of damage in the fights of the late game team, it can be more difficult for her to targets at one stroke because the enemies will start building defensive elements to protect them from her burst."}
{"text": "As vayne, Your goal is to get it out with your W in this matchup as much as possible. This will make you quite easy later. It can try you E in a wall if beware of your position near the field in this matchup. Any error can easily cost you the fight. Its Ultimate makes it really strong, and invisible, so make sure you label it with your W. In this way you will be able to see gradually it silohuette and know where it is. Keep the wave somewhere near your turn in this matchup. This will give you many opportunities to bring the enemy under the risk of ganks of your Jungler/laners."}
{"text": "As ashe, Ashe should focus on the enemy with her y out of sight when possible. Track brushes should be controlled by her because she has the reach advantage over most other champions. She should use her k carefully in this way. That's because it can help Jungler a lot when it comes to detecting the enemy Jungler without putting Ashe's life in danger. Getting her Ultimate w will be a massive point in the game for Ashe. She can target CC with ease now, gets choices on the map, and inflicts a lot of damage according to what she's going to build."}

If they die at the beginning, you will not be able to win the fight alone.\n\nFocus the nearest enemy champion to your carries and work as a team to take down the enemy one by one. If you focus on the backline alone, you may be an easy target for the enemy and may die quickly. By focusing on the nearest champion, you will survive for longer and keep your carries alive."}
{"text": "As graves, Focus on securing the remaining Dragons / Rift Herald in the middle of the game. Getting as many Drakes as possible will increase your chances of winning the game. Graves is a strong skirmisher, so keep playing aggressively and looking for 1v1 duels in the middle of the game. Just make sure you don't die or get caught when Baron's about to spawn. Group with your team and look for seat goals / look for peaks like a team to open the map."}
{"text": "Against camille, Camille Support can be aggressive at levels 1, 2 and 3. Watch your positioning and stay away from the walls so she can't win an early health advance. Stay away from the walls, especially when her E is at the top. She can get killed and play games whenever her E is at the top. Then play around her cooldown. At level 6, Camille will try to play games with her Ultimate. Follow her Ultimate Cooldown and play far back, and avoid staying your welcome if you are weak to deter her aggressive play form."}
{"text": "As yasuo, His W is almost useless against you, as only your d can be blocked by it, but it can also save his demise by having it almost always off-cooldown.\n\nTry to avoid extended trades with Yasuo at all costs, as his abilities have low CD, and instead you should poke Yasuo with your d when he positions incorrectly.\n\nTry not to stay close to your minion wave, as Yasuo can use it as a way to close distance and make favorable trades for him.\n\nLet Yasuo push the wave at levels 1-5, as he can't really trade of dive you under tower unless he has jungle assistance, and use these windows to poke him down using your d and auto-attacks."}
{"text": "Against tryndamere, Tryndamere will look to split push during the mid-game and he\u2019ll rarely join team fights. You can use the numbers advantage to force objectives or look for favourable fights to gain an advantage.\n\nIf Tryndamere is split pushing in the bottom side in the mid-game, avoid sending lots of people to stop him when Baron\u2019s up. It will take you some time to kill him even if you commit 5 champions to kill him which could give his team lots of time to take the Baron.\n\nTry to fight when Tryndamere doesn\u2019t have his Ultimate e} up. This will make it incredibly difficult for him to dish out lots of damage in a team fight."}
{"text": "As vayne, Scales extremely well into the late game and can single-handedly carry a game if the game lasts for that long. She can even duel enemy champs due to her e mobility.\n\nExtreme mobility allows her to both dodge skillshots, and play defensively at the same time. This can be extremely obnoxious for the enemy, especially when Vayne is using her Ultimate n.\n\nHer s is a real game-changer for her as she can use it to completely win extended trades against other laners. It also allows her to cut through tanks\u2019 health bar like butter."}
{"text": "As neeko, Another point in his Ultimate R will allow him to inflict massive damage with his Ultimate R. The cooldown will also be reduced. It will now have its basic elements, allowing him to deal with a lot of damage. This will help his team during the fighting, especially the fights of choking points. The first ability will be maximized at level 9. This will increase his overall damage in the game, and she can easily ambushed someone."}
{"text": "As ekko, After your bot track has moved to the medium track, turn to the bot side of the map or somewhere on the map so you can continue to grow and win XP. Flank in team fights with your W and E to get up on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so that you can get in the quick fight. As you are good for getting choices and killing isolated targets, try to ambuscader and assassinate enemies who are alone or walk around Summoners Rift alone. After killing someone, make the call for a nearby goal."}

Keep them warded so you can see the enemy move around the map and see them starting the objective.\n\nStay with your team at all times. Avoid moving around the map alone so you do not get caught out. Getting caught out will result in your team having to play 4v5. Do not ward alone unless you know where the enemy is.\n\nPeel for your allies as much as possible. Keeping them alive for as long as possible in team fights is a must in order to win the game."}
{"text": "Against olaf, Once Olaf reaches level 6, it will be difficult for you to kill him or lock him up with CC. Do not commit to using any hard CC ability when you know that his Ultimate k is up. Olaf is a steep heavy jungler and will be looking for gank frequently in the early game to get himself and his allies in front. Olaf can solo goals in the early game with ease. If there are no gank opportunities for him, he can try to take the Dragon instead."}
{"text": "Against ekko, Ekko's main source of damage comes from his liabilities. Avoid letting him stack his liabilities by escaping his Q and standing outside his range E. Ekko will seek to set up a W stun by walking out of sight. Be careful of this and wait a few seconds after he appears again before trading with him. Ekko will seek to constantly push the wave with his Q. Punite him every time he uses it for the waveclear by engaging in trades."}
{"text": "As khazix, It will fall at the end of the game unless it is really far ahead. This is due to the enemy building defensive elements and completing their constructions. He will be able to get all his empowerments by now. This will always allow him to concentrate and kill isolated targets, especially if he manages to catch someone in the jungle or a side track. Kha'Zix will now have several articles. This means that he will be doing a lot of damage but will be killed if he is CC'd. He will have to look for flanks and play around the vision to succeed."}

You can even roam directly after recalling and then show up to your original lane with your Ultimate R.        "}
{"text": "As caitlyn, Caitlyn is a great champion at the end of the game. As long as you can kite on her, you will be incredibly powerful in the fights of the team at the end of the game. At level 16, Cait will put the third and final point in her Ultimate R. It's a good point for her because she can use it to finish higher health goals. But, just like in the middle of the game, she can't use it in a team fight that is one of her many falls. At the end of the game, Cait would have reached 100% critical strike."}
{"text": "As rammus, Rammus is really tanky during the late game. He won't take a lot of damage but can return a lot of damage if enemies attack him consistently.\n\nA maxed-out Ultimate 2 will allow Rammus to completely take over a fight. Since he can use it frequently, picks will be aplenty.\n\nRammus is pretty decent in late-game fights due to his ability to pick enemies off easily. He should focus on making sure that his allies don't get killed by flanks to ensure an easy victory."}
{"text": "As skarner, His early game can be quite good, especially if he is in a favourable matchup. Look to trade and skirmish with the enemy frequently.\n\nAt level 6, your trading power intensifies.

{"text": "As kindred, Avoid team fighting in the late game unless your Ultimate R is up. Fighting when it is on cooldown is a big-no-no and can cost you the game.\n\nWhen ahead, look for picks by waiting in high traffic areas for an enemy to walk by. If you\u2019re able to take down the enemy Mid, ADC or Support, you can use their death timer to end the game or take a major objective.\n\nAvoid dying and remain on the same side of the map as the next major objective.

You need to be proactive and look to gank whenever your Ultimate R is up.\n"}
{"text": "As malphite, Malphite is a strong Jungler, especially after reaching level 6 because he can easily inflate his allies with his Ultimate h. Malphite has a very versatile construction path. He can either go damage, damage or full tank, depending on what his team needs. Malphite is very good in team fighting because he can potentially land a five-person Ultimate h. Knocking several champions could win his team the fight."}
{"text": "As yuumi, Can undo a lot of poke, and give her a vital boost of movement speed to avoid incoming skills, especially champions with crowd control. Once she gets her Ultimate R, she can pretty much keep any form of engagement away from her port as long as she has her Ultimate R Up."}
{"text": "Against sylas, Always keep an eye on what Ultimate Sylas has. If her Ultimate R is a very strong Ultimate combat team, try to wait for it to cool down before forcing a fight. Look at the flanks as Sylas will often try to flank a combat team with her E to get started. Make sure no one in your team is standing too much before or out of position as it can allow Sylas to choose them with her E and start the team fight."}
{"text": "As veigar, Infinite scaling on his Passive makes him a late-game monster. He can quite easily start one-shotting people once he manages to get his first item.\n\nExtremely powerful when fighting in closed spaces as he can easily land his e and r on multiple targets while crowd controlling them with his n.\n\nVery high gank set-up potential with his n. This can allow him to call his Jungler to gank his lane and help him get an early lead, which will be quite devastating for the enemy team."}
{"text": "As ekko, It is important that you try to take these goals whenever possible to give your team an advance. Once Ekko enters, it doesn't have a lot of left. So, you can abuse that that you are a good against ganker. Playing around your Ultimate is crucial in this matchup. Try to make plays whenever you have your Ultimate at your disposal."}
{"text": "Against anivia, CC is your best friend against Anivia because she is sneaky and still. But she has tools to defend herself like her ts and e. To facilitate her lock, try to flank her rather than run directly on her to make her more difficult to escape. As Anivia will need to keep, you could set up a death bush around the Baron or Dragon and kill her when she goes to watch. You could then use her death timer to take the goal. If Anivia is going to miss during the middle of the game, she could try to set up a death bush herself. Ask yourself where would you be now if you were Anivia."}
{"text": "Against gragas, Gragas will look to gank a lot in the early game. Try to counter this by having good vision around the map so you can spot him before he gets to a lane.\n\nGragas is a strong dueler and can easily take down a target if he gets the jump on them with his E. If you can dodge the E, you\u2019ll have an easier time fighting him.\n\nAs Gragas will be ganking a lot early, his jungle will be open to the elements. If you spot him on the top side of the map, you should invade his bottom side jungle and steal away his camps."}
{"text": "As mordekaiser, Very strong potential duel in the way thanks to its W. This ability allows it both to block the damage as well as to heal itself of a respectable quantity. After six, it can select any target and convert the fight into a 1 v 1. This can mean hell for any still enemy or weak health carry that Mordekaiser can easily E>Q them. Once he gets enough items, it will be almost impossible to kill unless the enemy team concentrates him down."}
{"text": "As corki, At level 13, Corki maximizes his second ability which is usually his n. It is a very powerful peak for Corki as it will allow him to shred tanks in the end-of-game team fights. At level 16, Corki will put the third and final point in his Ultimate e. As the teams will regroup at this stage of the game, he will be able to bring them down a lot before starting a fight. Corki is very good in the late game as long as he is not late. Try and avoid falling behind in the early game to make you an overwhelming force to count in the late game."}
{"text": "As thresh, Thresh is a lane dominant Support. This means he can often win lane and win the game just by getting kills.\n\nHe has great pick potential thanks to his Q. One good Hook Q in the mid-game could snowball into a huge advantage.\n\nThresh has tons of roaming pressure. This allows him to impact multiple lanes and get his allies ahead. Look for roaming opportunities once you have Mobility Boots."}
{"text": "As rakan, Level 2 is the all-in power spike for Rakan. He should use the lane brushes and work with his ADC to get a kill early on.\n\nLevel 6 will be another decent spike for Rakan.

But don't over-force this as you'll take a lot of minion damage for no real reason."}
{"text": "As viktor, Very effective clear wave that also allows it to damage several enemies at the same time. This gives it an innate advantage against various matchups, as well as the priority of the way in general. Can disrupt a whole fight with its d and Ultimate m, so fighting in close spaces is very advantageous for him. It can also pursue a single target with a fantasy foot job, using its r. Its poke damage is heinous and very strong. This can allow him to force his enemy to roll out of the way and then take targets with a numerical advantage."}
{"text": "As soraka, As a Support, you are very vulnerable and can easily be killed by going to the room, when you're in motion around the map, and when you're alone. To reduce the chances of dying and being taken out of position, try to stay with your team at all times. Keep a constant eye on this main objective is fresh next. If it gets fresh soon, make sure to place the vision around the lens as quickly and as safe as possible before withdrawing to safety. Having the vision around the main objectives is the key. Look at your positioning in the team fights and try to heal the one that needs it most. Try to keep your ADC or principal alive as long as possible."}
{"text": "As ezreal, Stand behind minions to reduce his Q damage.\n\nEzreal is good in extended trades, so avoid going for extended trades with him.\n\nUnfortunately, their level 6 is stronger than yours, so be careful when fighting post 6.\n\nKeep the wave closer to your side of the map in the very early game. It will protect you from ganks and from them zoning you away from farm."}
{"text": "As soraka, Consider investing in healing reduction items or abilities to counter Sorakah's maintenance. This can help reduce their ability to heal and trade effectively during skirmishes and all-in. Keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map. This encourages Sorakah and their ADC to expand, creating opportunities for your gank jungler and potentially secure instigators' murders or spells. Take advantage of the windows of the opportunity to detach your ADC and harass Soraka when they have used one of their abilities. This disadvantage in the trades, because they have less ability to exchange effectively. Be aware that at level 6, Soraka's ultimate ability, Wish, can be used to heal his allies across the map. It is important to pin and communicate with your team when Sorakah reaches level 6, so that they can be cautious and adjust their game accordingly."}
{"text": "As yone, Yone will get two points into his Ultimate R at level 11, which will be a massive power spike for him. This is mainly because he can easily pick off enemies during this game phase, especially from the fog of war.\n\nAt level 9, Yone will have his first ability maxed out. This means that his trades will improve significantly, and he will quickly snowball the game if he manages to get some kills early on.\n\nYone is really good during team fights as he can pick multiple targets off with his Ultimate R.

Enemies will have a hard time traversing choke points now.\n\nHe will have a lot of ability Haste now, which means he can drop a lot more mushrooms around the map. The enemies will have to invest heavily in vision to keep themselves safe.\n\nHe will complete his build during this phase of the game, which will allow him to one-shot squishy targets. His t blind should come in handy during this phase of the game as well."}
{"text": "As chogath, ChoGath is immobile and has a very large hitbox. This makes ChoGath easy to invade and ambush with Rek\u2019Sai pre-6. Stay ahead of him so even if he Flashes, his hitbox is so big you can knock him up regardless.\n\nAvoid trying to 1v1 ChoGath after level 6 because Rek\u2019Sai has a much lower chance of winning the 1v1 due to ChoGath\u2019s Feast t. Instead, set him up to be caught out with your teammates since he has such little ways to get away from other champions.\n\nChoGath\u2019s Feast t causes him to have a huge advantage on neutral objectives like Baron or Dragon which Rek\u2019Sai can\u2019t contest with. Take extreme caution when ChoGath is near and avoid neutral objectives unless ChoGath is dead, unaware or zoned far away.\n\nChoGath has an extremely weak and linear gank pattern. Counteract this by warding the river bushes which will decrease a successful ChoGath gank considerably. In addition, ChoGath is also easy prey for a counter gank with Rek\u2019Sai if spotted trying to gank."}
{"text": "As rengar, After going in with your Ultimate R, be prepared to fall back and peel for your allies in late-game team fights.\n\nLook for picks in the later stages of the game. If you can pick someone off, you should rotate to the Baron or Elder Dragon.\n\nKeep a constant eye on which primary objective is spawning next. Do not split push or go on the opposite side of the map when a significant objective is up or about to spawn, and work with your Jungler to set vision around that side."}
{"text": "As brand, Brand is quite still. It can be frequently invaded by strong early game champions like Lee Sin, Elise or Pantheon. In addition to being quite still, Brand is also quite squishy. In team fights, he is inclined to everything and will die quickly if he is taken out of position."}
{"text": "Against galio, Avoid regrouping closely in team fighting as this can allow Galio to get a 5 man with his R once one of his allies has engaged. Space between each other for maximum survival from the go. If Galio uses his Ultimate R when you are close to him, you can disturb him with any crowd control capability. This will be very useful as it can prevent him from using his Ultimate R to help his allies."}
{"text": "As fiddlesticks, Your goal is to hide in the fog of war during team fights and then get a massive team-wide CC on the enemy team. Fighting around chokepoints should be very fruitful for you.\n\nRoam around when possible as your Ultimate R, E, and Q should make up for some easy ganks during this phase of the game.

{"text": "As fiora, Its passive with its Q allows it to do a lot of damage to both the squishies and the tanks while allowing its team to do what they want. Its W is the most important ability in its kit and it can completely cancel any form of damage and CC with this ability. The fact that it can block the damage of the Ignite tick itself can be tilted for its enemies. When it is used correctly, it can even CC a group of enemy champions by running against any source of enemy CC. If it manages to find someone separated from their team, it can one against one easily, even if it is behind. This is due to the amount of damage that it can pull out with its Passive and Ultimate R. These choices can easily allow it to pressurize and take part of the card."}
{"text": "Against taliyah, Try to match Taliyahs clear wave during the laning phase. Matching his clear wave will reduce his ability to wander. Taliyah does not have access to a harmful Ultimate R at level 6. If you are a champion with a strong Ultimate, try to abuse his weakness at that time. When trading with Taliyah, always keep behind at least 1 minon. This will make it very difficult for her to do damage with her Q. Make sure you also watch for her C."}

This is great for Draven because it will allow offer him additional protection in the late game.\n\nDraven\u2019s level 16 is pretty good. The extra damage his Ultimate t offers him will come in handy and allow him to execute enemies. As his Ultimate t is an AOE ability, it will also deal damage to multiple champions at once."}
{"text": "As velkoz, At level 16, Vel'Koz will have its ultimate R maxid. This means that it can now inflict tons of damage from afar even if it gets a stack of its passive on its enemy. Its release of damage will be really high due to the number of items it owns at that time in the game. It should focus on using the fog of war to pull out the enemies first. Vel'Koz will be extremely good in team fighting, especially fighting where it plays around choking points. This means that it can apply its passive batteries to several enemies, which allows it to kill a group of enemies more easily together."}

In some cases, it might not be worth ulting one person.\n"}
{"text": "As garen, If you are able to catch someone with the help of your allies, you will increase your chances of winning the fight. Peel for your team as much as possible in the team fights.

Anyone who is immobile will have issues with him.        "}
{"text": "As kayn, Your champion is really good at blowing someone up, so try your hardest to increase your lead by getting peaks. In team fights, watch to flank and blow up the most squishis enemies. Attacking on the side rather than running directly to the enemy will be your go-to-ground in team fights. Focus on securing goals like the Dragon and Baron in the middle of the game. As you are the Jungler, make sure you make the call for the goal when necessary."}
{"text": "Against xerath, Once Xerath is level 6 and unlocks its Ultimate 2, it will have a lot of poke and extra damage. Do not stay in the post 6 track as it might be able to sting you. When Xerath has its Luden, it will greatly increase its poke and push power. Avoid remaining in the minion wave so that it is unable to poke and push at the same time."}

{"text": "As jarvaniv, Look for choices during the middle of the game to get your team before. Getting a choice here or there or blowing an enemy Summoner Spell may be more than enough to get a goal nearby. Calling targets during the middle of the game. You are the after all Jungler and have to prepare and make the call to take a goal whenever it is about to spawn. Usually, the CDA and Support will go to the middle track after having secured the lower lane tower. If the enemy turns to the middle track too, you should look at the gank so you can get the murders and the medium track tower."}
{"text": "As veigar, Stay with your team in the late game. Do not separate or walk away from them otherwise the enemy can try to remove you or initiate a 4v5 fight when you are away from your team. Look for a choice with your n to win the number advantage. Then, use your Ultimate R to get them down quickly before looking to seat or take a goal nearby. At this stage of the game, you should have tons of batteries and be really strong."}
{"text": "Against gangplank, In team fights, try to destroy his Barrels E before he can blow them up. This will reduce his AOE damage and his ability to win fights.\n\nTry to avoid fighting in areas that are tight like around objectives or in the Dragon as his Ultimate R will hit your whole team. Fight in lanes rather than in the jungle and make sure you\u2019re not grouped closely together.\n\nWhenever Gangplank has his Ultimate R, ping your team so they know that he can impact skirmishes."}
{"text": "Against xinzhao, Xin is vulnerable to the CC during the team fights, don't ignore it. Focus on him when he engages. As he is a powerful champion of skirmishes, he will look for choices on enemies who walk around Rift Summoners alone. Avoid walking in areas that are not rewarded unless you know where Xin Zhao is. When Xin Zhaos Ultimate R is on cooldown, he is incredibly vulnerable. Force Team fights when his Ultimate R is down to increase your chances of winning the fight."}

If she isn\u2019t able to snowball, her mid-game is going to falter. \n\nHas an incredibly high skill cap. She is one of the hardest Junglers to learn thanks to her s, unique combos thanks to her r, and the constant need to kite jungle camps.\n\nWhile Nidalee is incredibly mobile, she is prone to CC. If they get caught out by any CC, they will probably die."}
{"text": "Against poppy, Avoid fighting around the goals as Poppy can use his Ultimate R to shoot down the Jungler and cost your team the Baron/ Dragon. In team fighting, disengage and avoid team fighting in the jungle as this will allow Poppy to get a good boost with his Ultimate R or choose a key target with his E. Fighting around Poppys Ultimate R is a good way to win team fighting."}
{"text": "As riven, If you can get a murder or two, you can snowball your lead quite quickly. Every time your Ultimate e is up, you can look for aggressive games to try to kill the enemy. Your Ultimate e is an excellent trading tool that makes you much stronger. Keep the minion wave even or slightly closer to your side of the map early. This will allow you to run the enemy down while protecting yourself from the ganks. If you keep pushing when you are not forward, you will be unable to run the enemy down and you will be an easy target for the enemy Jungler."}

Do not underestimate his all-in potential with his Ultimate.

{"text": "As jax, In the last game, continue to divide the push if your team is not at risk of dying or getting caught. If your team is going to get caught or if the game is not one way, you have to group with your team to help them fight.

Otherwise, if you have Teleport, you can go to the bot side of the card and use it to get it to your team."}
{"text": "Against graves, Vision is your best friend against Graves. If you can see him before he spoils a track, it will be harder for him to get killed and snowballed. Make sure you place quarters around his jungle entrances to spot him when he leaves his jungle. Grouping against Graves will prevent him from taking key targets in the team fights because he will find it hard to cross several champions at once. CC is also very good against him because he is quite still even with his Ultimate t et e. In the later stages of the laning phase and early in the middle of the game, he will try to kill isolated targets that walk through Summoners Rift alone."}
{"text": "As jax, The Jax O will be maximized to level 9. This will give it a massive increase in damage, and it will frequently use the ability. Moreso, it will allow it to mitigate more damage in turn. Jax is excellent during the middle of the game because it will have its basic items with it. This means that it can look for peaks and can quickly get killed on isolated targets. At level 11, it will have two points in its Ultimate t. This means that it will absorb more damage, completely plunge the enemy rear line, and still survive."}

When he unlocks his Ultimate at level 6, his death pressure increases. Keep this in mind and avoid staying in the way when weak. After Akshans first return, he should have taken a component element for his Myth. Unless you've matched him, be careful because he will win jobs and all-in."}

He can assassinate people if he goes for the Blue Form, while he can act as a frontline if he goes for the Red Form.\n\nDepending on the form and build, Kayn will either be a killing machine due to his burst damage or a tanky, unkillable frontline who will easily peel for his carries."}
{"text": "As talon, It can easily catch enemies wandering on their own. Another point in its Ultimate R will increase its overall damage in the game.

{"text": "As malzahar, Once you've changed with the average, make sure you have the average priority at all times. This will help a lot in neutral goal fights. When no team fight occurs, go on a side track and push. You have to continue growing during the middle of the game so you can get your items as quickly as possible. Do not just stay in the middle if you can't get anything done. Play around your ultimate R in the middle of the game. It's an incredibly strong tool that can help you get an advantage of killing. With the advantage of numbers, you can then make the call for Baron or seat a round nearby."}
{"text": "As diana, A good guard of the enemy team can reduce Diana's flank potential in team fighting as it will be detected by the enemy over time. This can really reduce her team fighting ability. When she spoils an enemy, if she misses her Q, her gank will probably fail because she will be unable to use her t twice. She will also miss a lot of additional damage. Unfortunately, Diana is counting on moving forward. If you don't advance it, the likely hood is that you won't be strong in the later parts of the game."}

Her Ultimate R is really useful in fights, so fighting when she isn\u2019t there is favourable.\n\nWard your flanks in the mid-game!

Try and stand back and out of range of him so he\u2019s unable to attack and harass you with his W. Ensure that you remain healthy otherwise you\u2019ll never be able to fight him.\n\nA good time to fight Brand is when he\u2019s out of mana or has an ability on cooldown. This will make trading much better for you as he will not be able to dish out a lot of damage (or possibly stun you if his Q is on cooldown) as he\u2019ll have 1 less ability to use."}
{"text": "As lillia, Lillia is really fast and mobile thanks to her Passive. This makes it difficult to catch her out of position. It will also allow you to avoid skill shots and CC. Your goal in early play is to win as much gold and XP as quickly as you can. Power farm and gank the tracks that are overstretched to increase your gold income. Your Ultimate R is an incredibly strong tool. Every time he is up to it, try to use it to help your allies get killed."}
{"text": "As yasuo, Once Yasuo reaches level 11, its Ultimate R will have two points in it. This will allow it to inflict more damage and will also allow it to deal with tanks more efficiently than the game continues. At level 9, Yasuo will have maximized its r. It is an excellent peak of power for Yasuo because its damage production increases massively and its tornado r increases considerably. The brushes of the track will help you a lot with that too. Its peak of power mid-game depends on his team comp as well. Yasuo will be able to do much more in the game with ease if the Yasuo team has a form of knockup on one of their champions."}
{"text": "As zac, Your tankiness will be god-like during this phase of the game so make sure that you set up fights and also peel for your carries during the fights.\n\nAs you get your items, you should have a really easy time blowing enemies up with ease.

Just make sure that you land the ability."}
{"text": "As shen, Use the lane brushes to your advantage and take control of them early during the game. It will allow you to E enemies easily. Roll around as much as possible and try to help other laners as well. This will grant you a lot of help that will be translated into gold. Peeling for your transport is your top priority in the way. After engaging with your E, step back and make sure no one gets too close to your transport."}
{"text": "As velkoz, Vel'Koz will have his Q maxed at level 9. This means that he will do more poke damage and completely dismantle an enemy range team. He will have two points in his Ultimate R once he reaches level 11. This means that Vel'Koz will use the Ultimate R more effectively as a final step to get rid of the low-health targets. Team fights will be really good for Vel'Koz due to his kit. If he manages to score a hit on a target, he will probably kill them instantly with his team."}

In the team fights, keep focusing the most squishi and the easiest to kill high priority targets in the backline. Flank in the team fights to get on the enemy backline easily. Make sure to be close to your team at all times so you can get in the quick fight."}
{"text": "As zed, Can catch ignorant enemies with his W E Q combo, especially when the enemy is last occupied hits a minion.

The only way to counter this is by ensuring you get pen items.\n"}
{"text": "As shyvana, After entering with your Ultimate t, be ready to fall and peel for your allies in the fights of the late game team. To make it easier to access the enemy backline, group with your team but stay out of the way. If you flank a nonwarded bush, the enemy will find it harder to react to your all-in. Avoid dividing or being away from your team in the late game as the enemy will force a fight while you're gone. Play around your Ultimate t in the later parts of the game. Avoid fighting unless your Ultimate t is standing. Fighting without this will make the fights of the late game team much more difficult."}
{"text": "As neeko, Your champion is weak in the early game. Avoid fighting until you have quite a few levels behind you. Once you have an item and some levels under your belt, you can look for skirmishes with the enemy.\n\nFocus on farming and picking up as much farm as possible in the early game. This will make you more of a threat in the later parts of the game.\n\nRotate and move around the map if your bot lane decides to rotate to the top lane after securing the bottom lane tower."}
{"text": "Against chogath, Cho=Gath is powerful at level 6 because it is able to inflict real damage with its Ultimate t. Always consider its damage results whether it is built as a full tank or AP. Cho=Gath becomes stronger and stronger than the game continues. Try to close it to make it useless in team fights, or finish the game as quickly as possible so that it can not become a mega tank. Every time he has his m or e up, his survival and self-pleasure are greatly increased. Wait for him to use one of these abilities before he engages or fights him."}
{"text": "As aatrox, Aatrox tends to fall later in the game that the enemy will buy items that against him. They will also be the group that makes it harder for Aatrox to secure the murders. If it can go to them, you will always be able to take charges in the fights of the late game team. Suppose you are able to land a W on high priority target- go and try to remove them. You have to play around with your Ultimate R in the late game. Fighting while it is on cooldown could be the difference between winning a fight and losing. When you have 3 points in your Ultimate, your support is very difficult to manage."}

{"text": "As kled, If Kled is against a remote match, he did not succeed from the farm safely while being dismantled. Missing his E will make it really easy for the enemy carried for the kite out. If he goes with his W on cooldown, he has won more effective than he should be in an all-in-one. If he uses his Ultimate R and the enemy manages to cut off his team from him, then he did not win any form of follow-up and his team will have lost their front line. This will cause a lot of harm and could cause a loss of team combat."}
{"text": "Against tristana, Her E and Q bring down turrets a piece of cake. Avoid letting her get free blows on your turret as the tower trays will give her a golden advantage over you. Avoid prolonged exchanges with Tristana every time her E is on you. The more she hits you with self-attacks with- the more damage you will take. Tristana will often use her W aggressively. If you are strong and have good all of it, you could try to trade with her and use her bad position to kill her."}
{"text": "Against rammus, The team fight can be difficult for Rammus as most players will disengage as soon as it runs towards them.

{"text": "As galio, Galio's prowess at the beginning of the game comes from his all-in-one combo. Level 3 is an important powerpike. Moreover, he will have both a clear wave and an all-in-one damage at his disposal. Getting his boots is a decent powerpike for Galio. It is mainly because he can quickly push the wave and wander on other tracks with the help of his Ultimate R. This will also allow him to quickly return to the track. Galio is one of those champions whose level 6 is not so great a power peak for himself. It is because it is a Ultimate R dependent on the team, and therefore Galio should try to compensate by trying to push the wave in and then wander to his allies."}

{"text": "As senna, She is very immobile and can be killed easily if she is all-in\u2019d. This can shut her down during the early game and force her to play defensively.\n\nHer enemies can look to all-in her as soon as she misses her W, so she needs to use that ability quite carefully. She will be more focused on getting her Passive stacks in order to be able to carry later in the game.\n\nThe E invisibility can be easily countered with a properly placed Control Ward. Her Q costs a lot of mana as well and can make her run out of resources if she uses that ability in a carefree manner."}

The power of his Ultimate R will still depend on the enemy team comp, but he will be able to use more ultimates in a given time.\n\nHis damage will be really significant during this phase of the game. The burst damage he can deal will completely catch enemies off-guard and ruin their chances of winning the game.\n\nSylas is quite decent during the late-game fights as he can deal tons of damage and heal himself for massive amounts at the proper time. It will let him separate the enemy front line from the backline and help his team a lot."}

{"text": "As cassiopeia, If Cassiopeia gets to Q you, make sure to use your W to block its tracking Es. This will make its mana of waste and will allow you to get the top. Once Cassiopeia gets its Ultimate R, you will want to be very careful when all-in-one. Make sure to look away from it the moment your Ultimate R animation ends. Keep the wave slightly on your side of the way. This will make Cassiopeia vulnerable to the ganks and leave you all in it frequently."}
{"text": "Against yasuo, Be cautious around the minion wave as Yasuo will often use his E to dash through the minion wave to get on to you. Stand outside and away from the minion wave at all times.\n\nTry to keep the minion wave closer to your side of the map early on. This will reduce his ability to play aggressive and look for an all-in.\n\nGood times to use CC abilities or to trade with Yasuo is when he is overextended after using his E. You could use his poor positioning to go for a favourable trade to get him low."}

He needs to hit level 6 as quickly as he can so he can unlock his Ultimate R and start ganking his allies. \n\nAfter Fiddlesticks has picked up his first component item, he will be a little stronger and he will be able to start dealing a lot of damage to enemies when he ganks his allies.\n\nAfter Fiddle has completed his first item, his damage output will dramatically increase. As long as you\u2019re playing around your Ultimate R, you will be very strong after completing your first item."}

He can also look for flanks and dive the enemy backline.\n\nHis early game will be pretty solid as he can just go for consistent all-in trades and get back to safety due to his y. He won't be taking a lot of damage with proper usage of that ability, but he will need to stay out of vision.\n\nHe is a decent skirmisher early on, especially once he gets his Ultimate *R*. Looking for clumped fights is his way to go.        "}

When compared to other Junglers, it doesn't bring a lot to the table.\n\nHer first ability will be maxed out at level 9. This will let her deal a lot of damage to enemies she has managed to catch. It will also allow her to thwart escape attempts from the enemy.\n\nPoppy is perfect during the mid-game as she can deal consistent damage and can CC enemies for days. Her tankiness makes it impossible for the enemy team to kill her as well.        "}

He is much stronger and has good gank set up when he\u2019s healthy and both of these abilities are up. \n \nGalio\u2019s biggest power spike is reached at level 6.
