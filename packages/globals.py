Input: Title: Â¯Eostre. Section: Theories and interpretations, Connection to Easter Hares. Content:
The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in
1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in
other parts of Germany until the 18th century. Scholar Richard Sermon writes that "hares were
frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the
origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition
that hares laid eggs, since a hare's scratch or form and a lapwing's nest look very similar, and
both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence
of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe.
German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the
Easter Bunny."

Input: Title: Udyr. Section: Udyr Guide. Content: Additionally, he can periodically empower 
one of his abilities. In addition, when changing stances he empowers his next two basic 
attacks to gain bonus attack speed and refund some of his passive. Udyr's Q isn't important 
as we don't level it. Udyr's W grants him a shield and makes his next two attacks gain lifesteal
and heal him. Of course making sure you use two attacks between each ability. For matchups, 
Udyr is amazing into tanky top lane bruisers who he can simply outvalue in extended fights. 
The longer the fight goes, the more you'll be rotating through your stances and getting your 
passive hits off, so the longer the fight, the more value you tend to get. 
However, at level 6 you don't get the big power spike so do care against champions that do.
